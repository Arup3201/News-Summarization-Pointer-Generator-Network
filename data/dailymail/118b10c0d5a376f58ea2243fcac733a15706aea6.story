A teenage boy has described the bizarre moment he was diagnosed with testicular cancer using a pregnancy test.   

Byron Geldard, from Huntingdon, Cambridgeshire, was given the test by doctors because the disease can cause the body to make the same hormone produced during pregnancy.

After getting a positive result, the 19-year-old was given the devastating news he had the disease and began seven months of treatment .

Now, after surgery and intensive chemotherapy, he is in remission - and has become an ambassador for Teenage Cancer Trust.

Byron Geldard, was diagnosed with testicular cancer using a pregnancy test. The disease can cause the body to produce the same hormone as produced during pregnancy

After the 'positive' result, the 19-year-old began months of treatment at Addenbrooke's Hospital, Cambridge

Mr Geldard said: 'It was all very surreal to be honest.

'There I was with a positive pregnancy test and something growing inside me. I thought I was going to end up in a documentary.'

Home pregnancy tests detect a hormone called beta human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) found in the blood and the urine which is produced by the developing placenta. 

Experts say beta hCG can also signal testicular cancer.

Dr Danish Mazhar, Consultant Medical Oncologist at Cambridge University Hospitals, said: 'The pregnancy hormone (HCG) is often (but not always) produced by testicular tumours.

'Where it is produced, it can used for diagnostic and monitoring purposes.

'In cases where the cancer has spread, the level of the HCG can be very high and if the clinical picture fits with a testicular cancer then a pregnancy test, which effectively is a test for HCG in the urine, can be used to make the diagnosis.'

Home pregnancy tests detect a hormone called beta human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG) found in the blood and the urine which is produced by the developing placenta. 

Experts say beta HCG can also signal testicular cancer. 

Rob Cornes, Male Cancer Information Nurse at the charity Orchid, told MailOnline: HCG is one of three blood tests performed in all men with testicular cancer - it identifies how active and possibly widespread the cancer may be.

'It can also be used to help monitor treatment and determine how well treatment is working and to identify men who may need more intensive treatment.'

However he stressed there are two types of testicular cancer - and HGC is not present in the majority of cases of the most common form.

And any man worried should not use a pregnancy test as a diagnostic tool. 

Mr Cornes added: 'To be picked up by a urine pregnancy test, the level of HCG has to be very high which will not be the case for many testicular cancers. 

'It is not and never has been a standard test 

'HCG can also be raised in the presence of other things such as illegal performance enhancing drugs (used by athletes etc.)' 

Mr Geldard claims his hospital experience was as bizarre as his diagnosis.

'When I was about to go into surgery, I had to have an epidural like a pregnant woman - it was all very weird.

'It's really hard to describe how it felt - you don't really come to terms with what's going on, you just go along with it - it took me a while to realise what was happening to me.

'I'm relieved to be in remission, and now I want to help raise awareness.

'Cancer is no longer a death sentence, and I would like to spread that message.'

Mr Geldard had just returned from a boy's holiday in Kavos last August, when a niggling pain in his side became too hard to ignore.

After visiting his doctor, who could feel a mass in his abdomen, he was referred to his local hospital for an ultrasound.

He said: 'Before I went to Kavos I'd been getting this weird pain on and off, but I didn't think much of it.

'I went to the GP about it, but because I was going to the gym it was just put down to muscle pain.

'But when I was referred to the local hospital scans showed that I had a tumour that was spreading into my lungs.

'I was told that it was cancer - but they weren't sure what type - and that I would probably need chemotherapy.'

Mr Geldard was referred to the Teenage Cancer Trust unit in Cambridge, where doctors tried to determine what type of cancer he was suffering from.

It was there that he was asked to provide a sample for a pregnancy test, to determine if the tumour was producing the hormones linked to both pregnancy, and testicular cancer.

Looking back, Mr Geldard said: 'It's really hard to describe how it felt - you don't really come to terms with what's going on, you just go along with it - it took me a while to realise what was happening to me'

After getting a positive result from the pregnancy test, Mr Geldard was diagnosed with stage four testicular cancer - which had spread to his abdomen and lungs.

The news came just a day before he received his A-level results. 

In 2012, a man credited the popular social news site Reddit with helping him catch his testicular cancer at an early stage.

The patient, who was not identified, took the test left in his apartment by an ex-girlfriend as a joke - but was shocked to discover two pink lines indicating pregnancy.

The incident was turned into a crudely drawn black-and-white comic strip by a friend, who put it up on Reddit where it attracted more than 1,300 comments from concerned users.

'If this is true, you should check yourself for testicular cancer. Seriously. Google it,' one commenter wrote.

The Reddit user who put up the cartoon passed on the concerned comments to his friend on Monday, the man made an appointment with a doctor who diagnosed him with cancer after detecting a small lump in his right testicle. 

He said: 'I gave the hospital a urine sample, the pregnancy test came back positive, and I started chemotherapy the day after I was diagnosed.

'I would go in for five days in a row and have the chemo constantly.

'It really took it out of me - my brain was muddled and I found it hard to concentrate on long films or books. 

'I suppose I did have some thoughts about death, but I didn't want to approach cancer in a negative way.

'For me, the cancer diagnosis was a positive thing, because it meant that a plan could be put in place to get rid of it.

'Throughout my cycles of chemo the hospital would monitor the "pregnancy hormone" through blood tests.

'The hormone had been really, really high, but it was gradually declining which was great news, and the tumours in my lungs and abdomen were shrinking.'

In December, Mr Geldard had surgery to remove the growth in his abdomen (and the surrounding lymph nodes) and a testicle.

In January, tests revealed he was cancer free. 

He said: 'It was a really strange feeling to be told I was OK again - you're just sort of expected to go back to normal, but my mindset has completely changed.

'Before all this happened I thought my life was pretty much guaranteed until I was about 85.

'But it gave me the realisation of my own mortality - I sort of had an early midlife crisis.'

He now plans to  attend university and says he 'just wants to enjoy life'.  

'I'm doing stand up comedy about testicular cancer, as I think people need to be educated about it more.

After chemotherapy, which caused him to lose his hair (right), Byron is focusing his energy on living life to the full and raising money for the Teenage Cancer Trust

'I hated hearing people talk about cancer all the time, and I just thought this is a different way to approach it.

'It's something a bit different, and a way to show that cancer doesn't always have to be a death sentence.'

Throughout his cancer journey, he was supported by Teenage Cancer Trust.

He said: 'The Teenage Cancer Trust ward was great, the ward is kitted out with a TV, pool tables and free WI-FI.

'Everyone is going through the same thing so you get a lot of support.

'I even had the opportunity to meet John Bishop and Stephen Fry when I was there.

'It gave you an aspect of normality through everything that was going on.'

Testicular cancer (pictured) is one of the most treatable forms of cancer 

Cancer of the testicles most commonly affects men aged 15 to 45, with around 2,200 cases diagnosed each year.

Around 47 per cent of men diagnosed with the disease will be under 35 years old.

Despite it being a relatively rare form of cancer, it is one of the more treatable.

If caught at an early stage, men can expect a high cure rate with 98 per cent of sufferers disease-free a year after treatment.

If caught at any stage, 96 per cent of men will still be alive 10 years after their treatment.

Unlike many cancers, there are few known risk factors for testicular cancer.

Men born with an undescended testicle, are at a slightly greater risk. Around 10 per cent of sufferers will have a history of this condition.

Having a brother or father affected by testicular cancer can also increase a man's risk.

Some research has suggested the disease is slightly more common in men with fertility problems and men with HIV are more likely to develop testicular cancer.
