Forget TfL workers and impatient bankers, London commuters have been joined by a surprisingly seductive group on their way to work.

Travellers on the Northern Line were given an interesting wake up call when a lingerie brand launched its new collection at an Underground platform.

Transport for London gave permission for the catwalk show to take place at the newly reopened Tottenham Court Road Tube station on Monday.

Lingerie brand Bluebella gave morning commuters a shock when they showcased their latest collection on a platform of a London Tube station

Models from the brand Bluebella posed among travellers for the label's latest collection, and in true British style many commuters pretended not to notice.

The brand chose the Underground to launch their new spring/summer creations to give commuters a pre-work pick-me-up.

Bluebella founder Emily Bendell says that the idea was to share the brand's ethos with the weary travellers.  

'Bluebella is all about confidence and enjoyment and we thought it would cheer up a few commuters on their way to work to watch a catwalk show with gorgeous models.'

Emily added that she wanted to demonstrated that luxury lingerie shouldn't be saved for best and can be worn at any time and any place 

Emily added that they wanted to demonstrated that their lingerie can be worn anywhere and everywhere even if that is on the tube.  

'We believe in never saving anything for best so our lingerie is designed to make you feel fabulous every day. Why not make a grey day special by wearing beautiful lingerie under your clothes?'

'Great lingerie gives you an inner confidence - even if you are jammed against other travellers on the morning commute.'

One of the models, Jennifer Anstead, says that it had been one of her more unusual catwalk shows but she had really enjoyed the experience. 

'It was probably one of the most nerve-wracking catwalk shows I've ever done, but it was very exciting and created a real buzz. I loved it.

'Going Underground is a great way to do a catwalk show.'

Bluebella was launched by Oxford University graduate Emily 10 years ago when she was just 24 after she spotted a gap in the market for luxury provocative designs at High Street prices. 

Chiswick-based Bluebella recently worked with author E L James creating the Official Fifty Shades of Grey lingerie - including the 'after dark' Black Label collection of highly erotic lingerie which was launched last month to tie in with the movie's release.
