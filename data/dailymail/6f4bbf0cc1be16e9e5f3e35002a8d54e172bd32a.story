They say there's no place quite like home and Chelsea certainly are believers of that as they trained at Stamford Bridge ahead of their home game against newly-promoted Leicester City on Saturday.

Jose Mourinho's side were pictured at their ground in action ahead of their opening home fixture of the season, with the playing surface on display nearly as impressive as the Blues' performance at Burnley on Monday night.

Mourinho's side were rampant in their opening game of the new season putting the newly-promoted Clarets to the sword, with a emphatic first-half display heavily contributing to the routine 3-1 win.

Level-headed: Jose Mourinho says Leicester's 'champions' mentality means they will be a tough side to face when they visit Stamford Bridge on Saturday

Mourinho will be looking for more of the same this weekend as his side look for to make it back-to-back wins, as he faces the Foxes for the first time in his managerial career.

Speaking ahead of the game at his pre-match press conference he said: 'The game is difficult for sure.

'Leicester are champions and they come with this winning mentality from the previous season, so have high expectations and motivations to play in the Premier League. They know that every point is important in this league, especially for the teams that fight to keep in the division.'

Nigel Pearson's men began with an encouraging 2-2 draw against Everton on the opening day, so will look to defy the odds again and cause a shock at Stamford Bridge.
