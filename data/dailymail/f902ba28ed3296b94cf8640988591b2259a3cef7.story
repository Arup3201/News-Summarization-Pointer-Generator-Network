He's already spent £125,000 on his quest for the perfect face and body but despite having had liposuction, multiple nose jobs and a set of pec implants, Rodrigo Alves, 30, is still not satisfied.

Now the Brazilian flight attendant has revealed that he is to have rhinoplasty for the fourth time - but will have to travel to the Middle East to have the operation after being unable to find a surgeon closer to home.

Alves, who describes his nose as 'totally botched', will travel to Dubai for the surgery which will be performed by a doctor from Iranian capital, Tehran.

More work: Rodrigo Alves, 30, is to have his fourth nose job but will have to travel to Dubai for the operation

'There is lots wrong with my wrong with my nose,' says the London-based 30-year-old. 'It's totally botched.'

But, after failing to find a doctor in his usual surgery destinations London, Miami and LA, he was pleased and surprised to find an alternative in Iran. 

'I have found this amazing doctor based in Iran,' he says excitedly. 'Apparently Iran is the country where people do the most nose jobs. 

'He guaranteed that he could give me my dream nose and said he can perform the surgery in Dubai which is much better because, as you know, I do most of my shopping in Dubai.'

Alves is no stranger to surgery and has already had 24 cosmetic operations at a total cost of £125,000. 

Along with regular Botox injections, he has spent £30,000 on three nose jobs, £20,000 on a surgical six pack and £3,000 on having his calves reshaped.

He has also spent £8,000 on having self-designed pec implants put in place and another £9,000 on two rounds of liposuction.

Just before Christmas, he splashed out another £5,000 on a hair transplant designed to fix his receding hairline.

The latter, however, doesn't really count according to Alves, who says looking like he does requires 'continuous maintenance'. 

'There was always going to be a need for continuous maintenance once I started on this journey,' he explains.

'There's always going to be things that you need to get topped up and done.'

Painful process: Alves says having so much surgery is all part of his journey and part of who he is

Expensive habit: On top of surgery costs, Alves spends £200 a month on lotions, gadgets and pills

Alves' quest for the perfect face and body began 10 years ago when he moved to London and felt himself to be unattractive in comparison with the people he met.

'I was surrounded by beautiful and trendy people but I felt like I wasn't welcome in their circles,' he explains.

'I am completely aware that I am far from perfection. I'm not deluded and I know I'm not the most good-looking guy. I'm just aiming to be the best that I can possibly be.' 

Luckily for Alves, a massive inheritance from his grandfather provided the funds to set about achieving his aim, beginning with a nose job.

Since then, the 30-year-old has completely remodelled his body, although he admits that his bulging biceps and sculpted six-pack could have been created by exercising.

'Basically I don't like going to the gym,' he explains. 'I just don't like it. My time is valuable and I need it to catch up on my sleeping and do other things.

'I do my muscle toning in my spare time when I'm here in my bedroom lounging or watching a film.'

Alves, who spends £200 a month on pills, gadgets and lotions, also owns a tooth whitening machine and happily admits that everything about him is artificial.

'I'm artificially made,' he says cheerfully.  'If you look at my chest it’s all made of silicone.'

Not all of his procedures have gone to plan however, most notably a recent bid to have his biceps boosted, that left him in agony after he developed an infection.

'I was lucky to be alive,' he says. 'I regretted [that operation] badly. I was crying all day. It was traumatic... It was really was very bad.'

Nevertheless, with another operation planned, the experience doesn't seem to have put him off cosmetic surgery.

'I don't think that I will really regret anything in the future,' he says. 'I really believe that everything I've done to myself was an investment.

'It is exhausting, it is expensive, it is time consuming but it is who I am and it is a long journey. Once you start, stopping is very difficult.'
