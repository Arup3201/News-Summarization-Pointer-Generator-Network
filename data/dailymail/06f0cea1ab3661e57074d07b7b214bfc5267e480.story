The threat was made at the Booralie Early Learning Centre in Terrey Hills

Parents have been sent into a mad panic about whether to send their children to a Sydney preschool this morning after a letter was found yesterday threatening that a bomb was allegedly in a child's school bag.

Police confirmed there was a 'threatening note' discovered in the kitchen at the Booralie Early Learning Centre in Terrey Hills on Sydney’s Northern Beaches at 9.30am on Wednesday.

The preschool was evacuated for a short period of time along with a neighbouring preschool on Booralie Road before police cleared the scene.

A staff member for the two preschools said on Thursday morning nobody was available for comment on the incident.

The alarming news was announced on the Northern Beaches Mums Facebook page alerting other mothers of the threat and asking if parents would send their children back.

However, the popular local mums online forum posted that the letter had actually been found on the director's desk.

The bomb threat sparked a lively discussion the Northern Beaches Mums Facebook page

‘Police have done all the appropriate checks and given the all clear and the daycare handled the matter professionally, however I’m still feeling nervous. Has anyone ever heard of a bomb threat at a preschool?’ the post said.

Then another post followed claiming the letter was in fact left on the director’s desk and ‘apparently it said there was a bomb in a child’s school bag.’

Mothers expressed their concern on the local mums Facebook page about sending their children back to the preschool following the incident.

‘I don’t think I could send my child back there just in case as I would never forgive myself is (sic) something happened,’ one said.

Another mother asked to be personally messaged with more information as she was concerned about the news - especially considering her son was scheduled to attend the preschool this morning.

While other mothers simply dismissed the note as a cruel hoax.

‘Really how people can make a threat like that is beyond me. We have no problem sending our son back. But you’re right to feel nervous,’ one mum posted.

Another urged parents not to give the 'scumbags the satisfaction' of not sending their children.

A mother, who is a director of another preschool, tried to reassure her fellow local mums that it was more than likely a disgruntled parent or staff member.

‘We have procedures, policies and training with my organisation in this area and bomb threats in the early childhood field are more often than not made by disgruntled parent or staff member and highly unlikely to be serious – definitely send them.’

Police appeal for anyone with information to come forward.

A spokesperson said the site was cleared by specialist officers after the preschools were closed temporarily.
