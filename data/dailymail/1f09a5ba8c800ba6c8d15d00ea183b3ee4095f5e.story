These shocking photographs lay bare the extent of obesity in Britain, with school uniforms being sold in super sizes to fit overweight children.

Items on sale at stores in Burnley and Clitheroe, Lancashire, include trousers with a 48in waist, classed as 5XL, and blazers with a 56in chest - which is 16 sizes bigger than the average adult fit.

It comes a month after doctors warned childhood obesity in the UK had reached ‘alarming’ levels with up to a third being dangerously fat, and that British girls under 20 were the fattest in Europe.

Obesity Britain: Shahid Aslam, 29, and Janet Aslam, 55, of family business Moonline in Burnley, Lancashire, show examples of oversized school uniforms that they sell. These trousers are XXXXL and the blazer is 52in

Shahid Aslam, 29, whose family runs the Moonline children’s clothes shop in Burnley, said: ‘We’ve introduced sturdy fit trousers that go up to a 48in waist - and believe me, we do sell them.

‘We have also sold large adult sweaters to children, when they’re not even in the last year of primary school, and we now do blazers up to 50 inches when it used to be 42.’

Before the start of the 2014/15 school year, uniform supplier Trutex, of Clitheroe, started providing made-to-order blazers for chest sizes up to 56in, the Lancashire Telegraph reported in September.

A spokesman said: ‘We work closely with our retailers, and over the last few years they’ve been advising us that parents are now often asking for bigger sizes of the garments we manufacture.’

In addition, Caroline Fotios, of uniform charity Mum’s The Word, said they have also had requests for surprisingly large sizes.

She said: ‘There was one recently where we had to find a large adult sweatshirt for a 10-year-old pupil. The child came in with his parent and I thought he was going to be much older than she said.’

Last month the Mail reported on how a study by the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health found British girls are the fattest in Europe, topping a league table of 22 nations in Western Europe.

British boys under 20 are 10th in the league table, with Greece at the top where one-third of boys are ranked as fat.

Recent research for the period 1980-2013 says there has been a substantial increase in overweight and obese children and adolescents in developed countries, including the UK.

The RCPCH wants a ban on advertising of foods high in saturated fats, sugar and salt before 9pm, and restrictions that stop them being advertised on internet ‘on-demand’ services.

Moonline has been supplying school uniforms in Burnley for almost 30 years, with its owners first trading at markets in 1985 - and opening their first store in 1992.
