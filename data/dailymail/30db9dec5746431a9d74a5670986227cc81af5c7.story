Senator Rand Paul was spotted hobnobbing at a party in the Hamptons last weekend after he claimed he could not attend a high-profile conservative event he was listed as a sponsor of because he had a 'family commitment.'

Paul told the Family Leader he had to skip the group's annual summit on Saturday because he had to attend an event in New York with his family.

The presumed 2016 presidential candidate's absence at the influential Iowa gathering was called into question, however, after the New York Post reported that Paul and his wife, Kelley, attended the East Hampton Library fundraiser that day.

An aide to Paul told The Des Moines Registrar that Paul was indeed in New York for a family event, which Paul, his wife Kelley and one of their sons attended. The Hamptons party was a bonus stop, the staffer claimed.

'We have some friends up here,' Paul told Bloomberg Businessweek of his visit to the Hamptons. 'They invited us to meet some of their
friends.'

The Pauls spent the weekend in Hampton Bays with family friend and Hachette Book Group executive editor Kate Hartson.

Hartson is the publisher of Kelley Paul's upcoming book, and she has worked with both Rand and his father Ron in the past.

Hartson told Bloomberg that she and Kelley worked on photos for her book during the trip. Bloomberg reports that Hartson also took the Pauls on a boat tour, and the trio went fishing in Montauk.

It was another Hachette author, Nelson DeMille, who reportedly invited the Pauls to the library fundraiser, which was co-sponsored by actor Alec Baldwin.

The 10th annual Authors Night Benefit was held at Gardiner Farm in East Hampton and attracted approximately 1,000 attendees.

Doug Stafford, Paul's political adviser, told the Registrar that the Pauls dropped by the fundraiser at the request of Hartson.

At the party Paul was photographed yucking it up with Fox News host Bill O'Reilly and other members of the New York elite.

Bob Vander Plaats, president of the Family Leader, an evangelical Christian group, indicated to the Registrar that he was not impressed with Paul's behavior last weekend.

'From my perspective, there are always choices to be made of where do
 you want to be and what message do you want to send,' he said.

'If you want to be at a fundraiser in the Hamptons with the rich 
and famous, you probably ought to tell people you want to be at a 
fundraiser in the Hamptons with the rich and famous.'

After the brouhaha over Paul's weekend plans erupted, the Registrar says Paul's staff contacted the Family 
Leader chief to reemphasize that the Senator did not miss the group's event to attend 
the Hamptons fundraiser.

'I guess I can understand as [my wife] Darla and I have a family commitment in 
New York beginning tomorrow,' Vander Plaats said afterward.

The Family Leadership Summit - which drew 1,200 attendees this year - is considered a must-attend event for presidential hopefuls courting the right.

Texas Governor Rick Perry and former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum - both of whom are openly considering 2016 presidential runs - made the mecca to Iowa for the event.

Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal, former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee and Texas Sen. Ted Cruz also appeared at the summit. The three men are considered possible presidential candidates, as well.

As a consolation prize for attendees 
hoping to meet Paul in person at the Family Leadership Summit, the 
Kentucky lawmaker had event organizers play a video compilation of his 
pro-life speeches.

And while Paul did not attend Saturday's event, he did spend the first three three days of last week barnstorming the Hawkeye State, wooing conservative groups and headlining fundraisers for Republican candidates.
