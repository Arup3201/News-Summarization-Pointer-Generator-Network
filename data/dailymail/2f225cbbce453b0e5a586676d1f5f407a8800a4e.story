Tearful: This mugshot of Shanesha Taylor moved people on the internet to donate more than $100,000

A mother who won public sympathy - and donations of more than $100,000 - claiming she left her two little boys alone in a sweltering car only so she could attend a job interview is now faces charges for keeping the money to herself.

Shanesha Taylor missed a deadline on Thursday to set up a trust fund for her children with the donated money, as she had promised to do.

Breaching the deal means she will now face trial on December 10 on two felony charges of child abuse.

Ms Taylor, 35, of Phoenix, Arizona, became an Internet sensation after her tear-stained mugshot was published following her arrest for leaving her children - a two-year-old and six-month-old - in a 100F car while she went to a job interview.

She received $114,000 in donations from a public that seemed inclined to give her a pass for endangering her children because she was apparently trying to get a job and was heartbroken over what she had done.

Prosecutors gave her a break, too, allowing her to keep her kids and not face charges as long as she set up a $60,000 trust fund for her children with the donated money.

But Ms Taylor breached the deal by missing Thursday's deadline for putting money in the trusts, even after the amount of her payments was lowered to $40,000.

Outside a court hearing on Thursday, Ms Taylor repeatedly refused to say how much of the donated money remains, but said it was well over $60,000. She said she didn't fund the trusts because her children will not get the money if they choose not to attend college.

Prosecutors say the mother of three has spent about $4,100 per month, including more than $1,000 in non-essential items such as cable TV, clothing and dining.

Prosecutor Bill Montgomery said this week his patience 'has reached its limit.'

Ms Taylor said she isn't living an extravagant lifestyle, taking her children out to eat at places like McDonald's and Chuck E. Cheese's. More importantly, Taylor said, she is still looking for work on a regular basis.

Ms Taylor left her two sons - one two years old and the other eight months - in her car for about 45 minutes outside an insurance company where she was being interviewed for a job

Passersby called the police after noticing the boys inside the car. Police said the keys were in the ignition but the air conditioning was off and the fan was blowing hot air. Temperatures inside the car reached 100F

'I am not some lazy bum sitting on the couch,' Taylor said.

Ms Taylor was arrested March 20 after leaving her two young sons in her car for about 45 minutes while she interviewed for a job with a Scottsdale insurance company.

Authorities said the temperature inside the car exceeded 100F. A witness found the infant crying hysterically and sweating profusely. She told investigators she didn't have anyone to watch her then-2-year-old and 8-month-old sons.

Her situation, along with her mug shot, inspired a New Jersey woman to start an online fundraising campaign for her. Donations poured in.

She struck a deal with prosecutors in July that allowed her to avoid prosecution if she fulfilled a number of requirements, such as setting up the trust funds, taking parenting classes and completing a substance-abuse treatment program.

Firestorm: A struggling New Jersey mother set up this youcaring page for Ms Taylor. It raised more than $100,000 but also been a forum for heated comments in support and against of Shanesha

Divisive: Ms Taylor's story split public opinion between those who are supportive of a mother on food stamps trying to get ahead any way she knows how and those who believe she should never put her kids in danger under any circumstances

Prosecutors backed out of the deal after they say Ms Taylor failed to put $60,000 in the trusts. Still, they gave her another chance by lowering the amount to $40,000 as they negotiated with her.

Ms Taylor told Maricopa County Superior Court Judge Michael Kemp she missed the deadline for making the trust deposits because she thought it was Nov. 15.

Ms Taylor's attorneys, Benjamin Taylor and John Agra, were clearly frustrated at Thursday's hearing and asked the judge to remove them from the case.

'This is a deal of a lifetime,' said a clearly frustrated Benjamin Taylor, who isn't related to his client.

Taylor said she and her attorneys have experienced a 'communication breakdown' in recent weeks.

The blown deadline has sparked criticism and speculation on social media. Some people say Taylor is not worthy of sympathy, while others have accused her of already spending the funds. But she also still has supporters who are giving her the benefit of the doubt.

Gary Braden of Phoenix donated twice to the online fund. He said her request to put less money into the trust funds doesn't necessarily mean anything unethical is going on.

'They keep saying she spent it all. Then why would she offer to put up $35,000?' Braden said. 'I put myself in her position. If I don't have a job, I'm not going to put up a bunch of money that I can't touch.'

Braden said he will continue to follow the case, but he has no regrets about opening his wallet.

'As far as I'm concerned, she could have burned the money. It wouldn't have bothered me,' Braden said. 'Whatever the person did with the gift, that's on them.'
