If you think your Christmas schedule is hectic, then spare a thought for mother-of-nine Rayna Warriner, from Bournemouth,  whose festive preparations begin in January and are planned with military precision.

Rayna, 39, spends all year organising the festivities for her large brood of children, all aged between six and 16.

To ensure she sticks to her strict budget of £3,000, she starts shopping for bargain gifts in the New Year sales - 11 months before the big day.

Big family: Rayna has nine children and needs a 10.6kg turkey and eight tins of Quality Street to feed them

Tough job: Rayner Warriner starts preparing for Christmas in January and needs 110m paper to wrap her gifts

'For most people Christmas is busy but for me it's an average day,' explains Rayna. 'I
 hear people tell me they are worried because they have nine people 
coming for dinner, and then it dawns on them that it's a usual thing for
 me.

'But it is brilliant fun and I love making it magical for the children, it makes me feel like I have done my job for them.

'I
 think the key to running Christmas smoothly with a big family like ours
 is organisation, and also realising that you are only one person and 
you can only do your best.'

To ensure the day goes perfectly for Eryn, 16, Jackson, 14, Harrison, 13, Callan, 11, Taitum, 10, triplets Meredith, Romany, and Ilish, aged eight and Avie, six, Rayna writes her food list weeks in advance and fills two large shopping trolleys with goods worth £550, including a 10.6kg turkey.

Along with the turkey she buys eight bottles of soft drink, six tins of Quality Street and dozens of boxes of biscuits.

Rayna's little helpers: All of the children, and husband Malcolm, pitch in and help put up the tree

Presents take five nights to wrap and require an astonishing 110 metres of paper, as well as piles of ribbon and bows.

Once the festive period gets underway, she and her husband Malcolm, a police sergeant, attend no fewer than six nativity plays starring their youngest five children.

She and Malcolm then supervise the decoration of their 8ft Christmas tree but because the children to help out, 
it takes minutes.

On the big day itself, Rayna less than three hours sleep as she waits until 3am to put out the children's stockings but is woken again at 6am by the excited youngsters.

After cramming the turkey in the oven, she and Malcolm, 53, take their brood to church for a Christmas service.

They return to their six-bedroom home in Bournemouth to eat dinner around the 12 seat dining table at 2pm sharp.

The family spend the rest of the afternoon unwrapping the piles of presents and assembling toys and Rayna finally gets a moment to herself at around midnight.

Rayna, who now works as a stress management consultant, says the experience of planning Christmas for her large family has provided her with useful lessons to teach her clients.

'Christmas starts for me in January,' she reveals. 'I start shopping for the kids' stockings then for things that don't date, like stationary, underwear and socks.

'By the time August comes around, I really start getting it in my mind and start buying their main presents.'

But present buying doesn't always go entirely to plan, so Rayna schedules in time for returning gifts should the children change their minds ahead of the big day.

'With new adverts on TV and new toys out all the time, what the children want can change all the time so sometimes I have to return and swap a few gifts over the year.

'I spend about three days wrapping presents and on Christmas Eve I stay up until about 3am putting them in their stockings and hanging them up.

'Once they have opened their stockings we all go to church because I think that shows them what the true meaning of Christmas is.

'We have Christmas dinner at about 2pm which might sound stressful but as I do a roast every Sunday anyway for that many people, it's not too bad.'
