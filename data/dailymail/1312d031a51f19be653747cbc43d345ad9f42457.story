A 33-year-old woman has leapt to her death from the 24th floor of a luxury Manhattan apartment block, authorities said today.

Taheri Sunnuz died on Sunday after smashing a bedroom window at an apartment on the Upper East Side and throwing herself out.

The woman had been visiting a couple who lived in the building at the time of her death.

Miss Sunnuz was described as 'irrational and irate' when she got to the home on 3rd Avenue and East 92nd Street, according to the New York Daily News.

The woman's parents were allegedly called to come and pick her up - but before they could so, she jumped to her death through the broken window.

The woman reportedly lived nearby on East 103rd Street.
