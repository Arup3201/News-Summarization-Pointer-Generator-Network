A mural featuring a four-metre high woman in a skimpy bikini has been ordered to cover up after protests from local Christians.

The mural of the scantily-clad woman was painted on a ride at the Brisbane Ekka carnival and slammed as inappropriate by the Australian Christian Lobby.

'Our children's innocence should not be compromised by attending the Brisbane Ekka,' wrote Wendy Francis, Queensland director of the ACL in an online petition aiming to have the mural removed.

'This imagery is situated in the section of sideshow alley where there are lots of little kids rides.

'If this image was in an adult workplace it would be deemed as sexual harassment and removed.'

The petition received more than 1,000 signatures.

On Sunday night, Monday a representative from the Royal National Agricultural and Industrial Association of Queensland said the 'inappropriate' mural had been covered up with placards in response to the protests.

She apologised for any offence the image might have caused.
