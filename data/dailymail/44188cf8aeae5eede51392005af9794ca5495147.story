Fierce speculation is surrounding the new season of The Simpsons when creators claim a lead character will be killed off - and religion will play a part.

The killing is rumoured to take place in the first week of the 26th season, which premieres on Sunday night.

But impatient fan sites across the world have been analyzing cryptic remarks by the writers for a hint of the explosive storyline as it approaches.  

Major storyline: Fans have been waiting for months for the 26th season which will kill off a major character

Creators announced the planned death in October last year, sparking almost a year of theories.

Last week, a reporter asked executive producer Al Jean if religion plays a part in the death, to which he replied 'yes'. 

According to Yahoo TV, the character in question cannot be played by an actor that voices any other role in the show, since the creators said in April: 'What we told the performer is, 'This does not mean the end of your participation in The Simpsons'' - suggesting they needed reassurance of that fact.

And Jean also revealed it is not an 'iconic character', saying: 'I'd like to say it's a great character, but I never used the word "iconic".'

He added that the actor who plays the character has won an Emmy award - but that applies to all six members of the main cast: Dan Castellaneta, Julie Kavner, Yeardley Smith, Nancy Cartwright, Hank Azaria, and Harry Shearer. 

Refusing to confirm or deny any of the suggested victims, he added: 'Some people have guessed it correctly, and some are really, really off.'

Cryptic: The show's executive producer Al Jean has said the death will involve religion in some respect

One detail that has been revealed about the episode titled Clown in the Dumps is that Krusty the Clown decides to retire after a celebrity roast goes bad.

'I think it's an emotionally resonant episode and people will really like it,' says Jean.

The Simpsons, now the longest-running prime-time TV series of all time, has become a $12 billion franchise, with merchandise lines selling everything from toys to clothes.

Cast deals expire at the end of this year, but Jean says he anticipates more Simpsons seasons to come. 

The series averaged 5.8 million viewers for original episodes last season.

 'Nobody has said anything to me about ending it or doing a finale. My guess is at least two more years or maybe four or maybe more,' Jean says. 'We're doing pretty well right now.'
