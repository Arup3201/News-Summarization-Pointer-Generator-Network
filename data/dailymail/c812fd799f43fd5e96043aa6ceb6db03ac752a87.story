Iceland midfielder Gylfi Sigurdsson scored twice against Holland to pile pressure on Guus Hiddink.

Hiddink's second reign as Holland manager has not got off to the best of starts as he has witnessed his side lose three of their first four games.

Swansea star Sigurdsson followed up his goal against Latvia by converting a penalty past Jasper Cillessen to open the scoring in the 10th minute.

Sigurdsson's goal from the spot came after Stefan de Vrij was adjudged to have fouled Birkir Bjarnason inside the area.

And the midfielder doubled his side's lead just before the interval when he punished Holland for their slack defending inside the box by blasting the ball past the helpless Cillessen.

Hiddink threw on Klaas Jan Huntelaar at half-time - to join the likes of Arjen Roben and Robin van Persie - in hope that he could ignite their attack, however they were unable to find a way back into the game.

Holland started the second half with Van Persie hitting over from outside the box. Another fine Daley Blind cross looked set for his Manchester United team-mate to pull a goal back for Holland but the pass was deflected away from the forward's grasp.

Jon Dadi Bodvarsson could have made it more comprehensive for the hosts as he broke clear with minutes remaining but failed to hit the target.

Iceland now have nine points from nine in Group A and sit alongside the Czech Republic, who also have a 100 per cent record.

Holland have just three points, with their first ever loss to Iceland arriving after an opening defeat by the Czechs.

The expanded version of Euro 2016 means they remain alive in their bid to qualify, but their form - on the back of World Cup semi-final disappointment - suggests they will have a job on their hands to make up the gap.
