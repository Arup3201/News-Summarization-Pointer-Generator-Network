Dr Drew Pinsky, host of Dr Drew On Call, was diagnosed with prostate cancer in 2011 and has written about his experience

Putting off going to the doctor to avoid a prostate exam is an experience known to many middle-aged men.

You might have though that middle-aged doctors might be better at getting themselves a check-up, but as the testimony of one man shows, that's not always the case.

Dr Drew Pinsky, host of HLN show Dr Drew On Call, has revealed in a post on the TV network's website that he had his prostate removed after suffering from cancer for two years.

He is speaking out for the first time in a bid to raise awareness of the disease which will affect more than half of all men who live until they're 80.

In the heartfelt piece, he writes: 'I want you to hear it from me. Not from the Internet. Not from a gossip column. Not from someone who doesn’t know me.

'And I want to make you aware. Men, you are likely to get prostate cancer. The odds are you will if you live long enough. When you do, don’t freak out. You don’t need to take action today. In many cases, time is on your side.'

In the confessional article he explains how, despite being a doctor himself, it was actually his wife that convinced him to get tested.

Once the signs of cancer were detected, Pinsky's doctor decided to order a biopsy despite the TV star insisting that nothing was wrong.

Speaking about the biopsy, he says: 'It was awful. They don’t put you under. They take a prostate tissue sample through the anus.

Dr Drew has revealed he was back at work 10 days after his operation, is now back to working out, is eating well and feels good

'What they discovered was a low-grade tumor. What I discovered is that my own intuition and judgment were telling me that I had nothing to fear. But I had prostate cancer, for sure.'

According
to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 200,000 men in the US
will be diagnosed with prostate cancer this year, and 25,000 will die 
from it.

It
is most common in men over 65, and by the time men reach 80 there is 
more than a 50 per cent chance they will have developed it.

It has very few outward signs and can often remain undetected for years before sufferers develop symptoms.

However
research has found that, if carefully monitored, only a third of cases will 
get worse. One third will remain unchanged, and one third will get 
better.

Risks
associated with surgery include loss of sensation in the penis, 
incontinence and infertility, meaning men are reluctant to get tested in
case they need the procedure.

Together he and his physician decided to watch and wait, knowing that there was only a 30 per cent chance of the tumour getting worse.

But after a year of observation and two more biopsies there was evidence that the tumour had grown and become unpredictable. The decision was made to remove it.

The surgery involved a four-armed robot, operated by a surgeon, making its way into his pelvis via four incisions to remove the kiwi-sized gland.

However, when it was taken out, and despite the pain of recovery, Pinsky was glad he had opted for surgery.

The tumour had grown a 'finger', meaning it was about to spread to other areas of his body had it not been removed.

It took him 10 days to return to work following the operation, though he says that in hindsight his jobs - presenting his HLN show alongside the Dr Drew Podcast - could have waited longer.

He recommends that other men get screened for the disease, though he admits the PSA test is complicated and controversial, and says not to avoid a biopsy just because it affects a sensitive area of the body.

He also thanks his wife, Susan, for making him go to the doctor.

Dr Drew is a practicing physician, Board Certified in Internal Medicine, Board Certified in Addiction Medicine and a member of the staff at Huntington Memorial Hospital.

Pinsky is also Assistant Clinical Professor of Psychiatry at the Keck USC School of Medicine.
