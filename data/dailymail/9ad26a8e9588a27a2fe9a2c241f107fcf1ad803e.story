A soldier returned home from the front line to find the dead body of his fiancee, who had hanged herself after suffering from postnatal depression.

Linzi Mannion had told friends she was looking forward to marrying Lance Sergeant Robert Kopicki and was busily decorating their new home.

But the mother of two committed suicide the night before her fiance returned from his post in Afghanistan and he discovered her body.

They had spoken on the phone the night before and he said she seemed in good spirits.

Shocked friends who had been with the 29-year-old hours before her death on August 30 said she seemed her ‘normal, jolly self’.

An inquest yesterday heard she had been diagnosed with postnatal depression after the birth of  her second daughter Nancie on  April 24, and was prescribed anti-depressants.

'Impulse': Linzi, pictured left with her two 
children and right with Mr Kopicki, was suffering from post-natal 
depression and acted impulsively, a coroner said. Miss Mannion told 
friends she was excited for the return of Mr Kopicki and was looking 
forward to enjoying life at their new home

Sgt Kopicki, 28, who serves with the 1st Battalion Scots Guards, told the hearing: ‘After the birth Linzi began to suffer from depression.

She had some anti-depressants from the GP which seemed to help her. In June she tried to harm herself but she was so upset and traumatised by that. She just couldn’t cope.’

Doctors who were monitoring the healthcare assistant had believed her condition was improving, and Sgt Kopicki didn’t suspect she was contemplating suicide.

He said: ‘We were looking forward to getting married. The house was getting decorated and I was coming home the following day. On the evening before I came home I spoke to her and we exchanged texts.

'She phoned me at 10.30pm when she was with all her friends. There was no warning of what was to happen.

‘When I came home I found Linzi and she had died.’

On the night of her death Miss Mannion, who also had an elder daughter Maddalyn, had been decorating her home in Kearsley, near Bolton, with the help of her friend Lee Bleakley, who she had known since she was 18.

Mr Bleakley left around 9.30pm and Miss Mannion went to visit another friend and drank some wine.

Later the same night Miss Mannion rang Mr Bleakley asking him to come back round to her home to finish off the decorating before Sgt Kopicki returned the next morning.

Happy: Miss Mannion's friends said they had no reason to believe she would harm herself

Mr Bleakley said: ‘I said I would come round in the morning before Rob came back home to help with the decorating. She seemed all right when I spoke to her but a little bit drunk. We had been having a laugh and a joke that night and she was saying how happy she was with her kids.

‘I have known her a long time so I would know if there was something wrong. She just seemed the normal Linzi to me.’

Post-mortem examination results showed Miss Mannion was at more than twice the drink-drive limit, Bolton coroner’s court heard.

Coroner Jennifer Leeming, who recorded an open verdict into Miss Mannion’s death, said there was nothing in her behaviour which could have indicated she was planning to take her own life.

‘Clearly it was impulsive,’ she said. ‘I suspect if she could, she would say that she didn’t really mean it. Please accept my sincere sympathy for your loss.

Around 10-15 per cent of new mothers suffer from post-natal depression, but help is out there (file pic)

Feeling 'low' after having a baby, 
also known as the 'baby blues', is so common it is considered normal, 
but 10-15 per cent of mothers go on to develop a much deeper and 
long-term condition called post-natal depression (PND).

It
usually develops within six weeks of giving birth and can come on 
gradually or suddenly, and can range from being relatively mild to quite
severe.

Sufferers may feel sad or low, unable to
cope, and hostile or indifferent to their husband, partner or baby.  
They may have thoughts about death, be unable to sleep, and feel 
hopeless about the future.

Many
of those who suffer from it do not want to admit to it, but doctors say
that if PND is diagnosed and addressed, it is likely to pass sooner and
to be less severe.

Treatments
for PND include counselling and psychotherapy, and antidepressants, 
which can be very effective.  Tranquilisers and sleeping pills may also 
be offered for short-term use.

Some
women find complementary therapies such as cranial osteopathy, massage,
and reflexology can be a help in reducing symptoms of depression and 
anxiety.

Practical and 
emotional support from friends and family has also been shown to be a 
great help to those suffering from PND.  Getting out to meet other 
parents can be a lifeline to new mothers who are feeling isolated and 
anxious after having a baby, while exercise can also work as an 
antidepressant.

Organisations such as the Association for Post-Natal Illness
provides a telephone helpline for women who believe they are suffering 
from PND and for medical professionals.  Call 0207 386 0868 
Monday-Friday 10am-2pm.

Other telephone helplines available 24 hours a day include Parentline on 0808 800 2222 or the Samaritans on 08457 90 90 90.

Emma Cadywould: A new mum killed by a speeding train was suffering from 'one of the worst cases of post-natal depression' a coroner had ever seen, he told an inquest into her death

The wife of an army major who was 
killed by a speeding train was suffering from 'one of the worst cases of
post-natal depression' a coroner had ever seen, he told an inquest into
her death.

New mother Emma Cadywould had battled the condition for six months before she drove to a railway line where she was hit by a train. 

Mrs Cadywould, known to friends as Emsie, was struggling to cope after giving birth to baby Harrison, who woke her up through the night, the court heard.

Despite
support from family, including husband Steve, and from friends, she 
regularly told loved ones she wanted to be at peace and expressed 
suicidal thoughts, it was said.

She
was prescribed anti-depressants to cope with the strain, which had also
taken a physical toll, as she started to lose her hair.

Swindon Coroners' Court heard that
on December 16, 2011, she left from her home in Watchfield, next to the
UK Defence Academy, on the Oxfordshire-Wiltshire border.

Mrs
Cadywould drove four miles towards Swindon, Wiltshire, where she parked
near the village of South Marston and made her way onto the main 
railway linking London with the West Country.

Shortly
afterwards she was struck by a train.
