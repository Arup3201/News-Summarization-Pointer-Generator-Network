A former volunteer firefighter has pleaded guilty to setting a fatal fire in 1986 that killed a Connecticut couple one year before he was dismissed for having a suspicious knack for finding fires.

Peter Waraksa, nicknamed 'Pyro Pete' by fellow firefighters in East Windsor, pleaded guilty on Thursday to two counts of negligent homicide, arson and burglary.

The 50-year-old was arrested in July 2010 – more than 23 years after the crimes – in connection with the deaths of 59-year-old Orie Weeks and his wife, 57-year-old Assunta Weeks.

Guilty: Former volunteer firefighter Peter Waraksa has pleaded guilty to setting a 1986 fire that killed a Connecticut couple in their home more than 23 years ago

The couple were found dead in their home on Oct. 7 one year before Waraksa was dismissed by the Warehouse Point Volunteer Fire Department in 1987 on suspicion of setting fires throughout the area according to an arrest report.

A retired fire chief and fire marshal of Warehouse Point told investigators in 2010 that the number of brush, grass and structure fires significantly increased after Waraksa became a firefighter.

He said 45 fires were found within a one-mile radius of his home between 1984 and 1987.

He was also said to often be the first to arrive at fires, called in many himself, and found grass and wood fires no other firefighter could find.

Laurence Johnson, a retired East Windsor police officer, told police he was surprised when arriving at the 1986 fire that killed the Weeks couple and seeing Waraksa immediately there in full uniform.

Pleading guilty to two counts of negligent homicide, third-degree arson and second-degree burglary, Waraksa was sentenced to eight years and eight months in prison with 10 years of parole following.

At the time of Waraksa's arrest in 2010 he was already serving an unrelated five-year prison sentence issued in 2007 for sexually assaulting five boys.
