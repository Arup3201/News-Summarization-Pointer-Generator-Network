Hull manager Steve Bruce has defended under-fire Wigan chairman Dave Whelan, insisting he is not a racist.

Whelan has been accused of making anti-Semitic comments as well as claiming there was 'nothing bad' in calling a Chinese person a 'chink' during an interview with the Guardian.

That comes on the back of his controversial appointment of Malky Mackay as Latics manager at a time when the former Cardiff boss is under investigation by the Football Association for allegedly exchanging discriminatory texts with then colleague Iain Moody.

Whelan has come under fire and has faced accusations of being racist in some quarters

Whelan, 77, has since apologised for causing offence and Bruce, who managed Wigan on two occasions under Whelan's watch, is willing to stand as a character witness.

'Maybe sitting on the fence might be the easiest thing to do but I've worked under Dave Whelan twice - I know him very, very well,' said Bruce.

'There's no racism in him at all. Sometimes words can be said which can be misplaced, they can be out there in the public domain, but certainly when I've worked with him there's been no sign of racism.

But Hull boss Steve Bruce has defended Whelan and insisted that he is not a racist

'He is without question one of the best chairmen I've worked for. What you see is what you get.'

Bruce also described appointing Mackay as Uwe Rosler's replacement prior to the FA verdict as a 'brave' call.

'It's a big brave decision by him,' added Bruce.

'But he thinks that's the best thing for his football club. Being Dave he'll be single-minded enough to see that through.'
