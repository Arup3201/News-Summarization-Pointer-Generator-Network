She was nicknamed The Body thanks to her famous Sports Illustrated shoots, lithe limbs and golden glow and as Elle Macpherson turns fifty this weekend, she's keen to prove that she's most certainly still got it.

Speaking about her landmark birthday, the Australian model said: 'I am 50 this weekend. I feel loved, balanced, happy, healthy and at peace with who I am.

'Feeling good on the inside is more important to me now...looking good follows. My secret? Love, laughter...and my super greens.'

The body: Elle Macpherson is turning fifty this weekend and has unveiled her own super greens to celebrate

Like fellow models Miranda Kerr and Rosie Huntington-Whiteley, Elle swears by the power of all things green and she is so convinced by their potency, that she's unveiled her very own brand.

Today, Elle introduces The Super Elixir by WelleCo, a range of alkalising food supplements.

The new product was formulated over many years especially for Elle by Dr Simone Laubscher PhD, a Harley Street nutritional doctor specialising in disease prevention.

The powder, which can be sprinkled over salads or mixed into juices and smoothies, claims to support healthy nutrition and ensure your body is working to its optimum function.

Strength: 'The Super Elixir balances and strengthens me, to enable me to be the woman and mother I want to be, and now I want to share it!,' says Elle

The product, which costs Â£98 and launches on 22 May in Selfridges, is designed to support healthy nutrition at a cellular level and aid the digestive, endocrine (hormonal), circulatory and nervous systems. 

Packed with 45 key ingredients including alkalising super greens, Chinese herbs, and the miatake mushroom, Elle claims that just 10g of the powder daily contains all the vitamins, minerals and trace elements to assist wellness and vitally.

'There's so much discussion surrounding health and fitness but what I really aspire to is wellness. Spiritual, emotional and physical...and in my experience they are closely interrelated,' she explains.

Model behaviour: Britain & Ireland's Next Top Model, which Elle was a judge on, was cancelled last year

'It's not something you achieve simply through going to the gym, using expensive creams or speaking to a therapist, it's a feeling of balance and strength that originates from within and on a cellular level.

Elle's new collaboration comes at just the right time for the model, who was dealt two sets of bad news last year.

Fashion Star, the show she hosted in 2012 and produced in 2013, was cancelled in July.

Three
 months later it was announced that the other show Macpherson starred 
in, Britain & Ireland's Next Top Model, was also cancelled.

Elle, who began modelling in the early 80s in order to earn money to pay for her law books, also has several other business ventures under her belt, including a lingerie line and skincare range.
