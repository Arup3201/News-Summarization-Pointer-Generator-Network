For most people a ten kilometre run would be enough of a challenge whatever the conditions, but not this lot.

Wading neck deep through thick brown gloop, these intrepid athletes were clearly relishing the challenge of one the World's muddiest running races - the annual 10K Muddy Trials.

The event, which take place in the  grounds of Craufurdland Castle in Fenwick, Scotland, was first held in 2012 and has quickly gained a reputation as one of the most gruelling races in the cross country calendar.

Described by the organisers as 'very, very muddy', the course takes in almost impenetrable ditches and gruelling trails through thick forest and unforgving bog.

Racers must first cross fields and make their way through dense woodland after which they ford several streams before plunging waist deep through dark gooey ditches and dragging the,selves towards the finish line.

Conditions are so bad that before they set off, runners are advised to tape their shoes to their feet with industrial-strength gaffer tape to stop them getting stuck and coming off in the mud. 

But anyone can take part with a less demanding but similarly muddy 5km course available alongside the 10km course, and even a 'Muddy Mile' short course for youngsters. Some runners even brought along the pets dogs.
