Rafael van der Vaart has been enjoying his time away from club football by relaxing on holiday in Saint-Tropez with his girlfriend Sabia Boulahrouz.

Former Tottenham midfielder Van der Vaart was pictured with Sabia on a beach in Saint-Tropez on the same day Holland defeated Brazil 3-0 in the World Cup third-place playoff.

Van der Vaart was expected to be named in Louis van Gaal's 23-man squad for the tournament until he was forced into pulling out of Holland's preliminary squad as he was ruled out of the tournament due to a calf injury.

The Hamburg playmaker is dating former teammate and fellow countryman Khalid Boulahrouz's ex-wife after divorcing Sylvie Meis after an incident on New Year's Eve 2012.

Van der Vaart's Hamburg managed to avoid relegation from the Bundesliga by winning their play-off match against Greuther Fuerth on away goals.

The experienced midfielder will be hoping he can add to his 109 caps when he returns to the Dutch set up under Guus Huddink after sitting out Van Gaal's final few matches in charge of the national team.
