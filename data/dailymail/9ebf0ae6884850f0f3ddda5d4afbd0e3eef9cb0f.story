Bottles of wine should be labelled with cigarette-style warnings to alert shoppers to the risks of drinking too much, according to MPs.

They said most Britons have a ‘low understanding’ of the health problems associated with alcohol, which contributes to cancer, heart disease and strokes, as well as liver disease.

Tracey Crouch, Tory chairman of the All-Party Group on Alcohol Misuse, said it was time for ministers to impose standardised health warnings on beer, wine and spirits.

Warnings: The government has recommended that wine bottles should carry a stark warning: 'Alcohol kills'

 

They would be similar to labels on cigarette packets, with statements such as ‘Alcohol Kills’.

However, she stopped short of recommending what she called ‘shock and awe’ tactics, similar to pictures on some packets of cigarettes showing diseased lungs.

Miss Crouch said it was important that the warnings also contained the units and calorie content of the alcohol.

Professional women, whose levels of drinking have risen sharply in recent years, might be put off to learn there are around 700 calories in a bottle of wine, she said.

Last week the Mail reported that the Government’s health quango will tell Britons to avoid drinking alcohol on consecutive days.

Danger: The message would be similar to that on cigarette packets, but the print could be smaller

Public Health England says a ‘one day on, one day off’ rule is needed because daily drinking is a key contributor to increased health risks.

The MPs’ report out today says most drinkers do not know there can be up to 2.5 units of alcohol in a pint of high-strength beer, or as many as nine units in a bottle of wine.

‘Health warnings are a familiar and prominent feature on all tobacco products,’ the report says.

‘Likewise, detailed nutritional labelling is ubiquitous on food products and soft drinks. Yet consumer information on alcohol products usually extends no further than the volume strength and unit content.

‘In order to inform consumers about balanced risk, every alcohol label should include an evidence-based health warning as well as describing the product’s nutritional, calorific and alcohol content.’

Miss Crouch said the size and wording of labels would be up for debate. The powerful drinks industry would object to health warnings, she said, but lack of awareness was leading to ‘people regularly drinking far more than they should’.

Although the label recommendation are still at the proposal stage, it will put further pressure on the Government to act.

A Government spokesman said: ‘We are taking action to give people better information about the impact drinking can have on your health.

‘Through our Responsibility Deal, the drinks industry has committed to putting unit and health messages on 80 per cent of all bottles and cans.’
