Paris Saint-Germain are still keen to sign Chelsea midfielder Eden Hazard this summer, according to Laurent Blanc.

The mega-rich French side are also set to seal a deal for David Luiz, with a £50million fee agreed.

And Blanc admits that Hazard is their 'Plan A' in terms of attacking reinforcements this summer.

Plan A: Laurent Blanc has admitted he loves Eden Hazard as a player, he can open up a game at any minute

No holding back: Blanc says PSG are looking for two to four players this summer, despite FFP restrictions

'A player who an eliminate three, four players at any time a game is something else,' Blanc said at a press conference when asked on why he liked Hazard.

'We do not know what to expect with these players. They destabilise the opponent.

'Of course. There is also a Plan C. We will first focus on the areas of game where you want to recruit and propose three solutions. We know we want Plan A.'

Knowing that trying to prise away Jose Mourinho's most valuable performer this season may be difficult, Blanc also admitted that he 'can love a player, knowing full well I cannot have him.'

Despite Financial Fair Play restrictions, PSG are looking for between two and four recruits this summer, with Jeremy Menez and Alex definitely leaving as their contracts expire.

Exact terms are still to be thrashed out by PSG and Chelsea for Luiz, but the transfer of the 27-year-old Chelsea star will be the world's most expensive for a defender, beating the previous two highest fees - both paid by PSG, for Marquinos and Thiago Silva.
