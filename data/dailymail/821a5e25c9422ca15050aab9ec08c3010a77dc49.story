A Tory councillor named on an arrest warrant over a suspected revenge killing in Pakistan met David Cameron at a 10 Downing Street festival.

Abdul Aziz met the Prime Minister at an Eid celebration last month.

He is named on an arrest warrant in connection with the brutal killing of his cousin, who was gunned down with a .44 calibre rifle and handgun in Gujrat last year.

Mr Aziz, a councillor in Pendle, Lancashire, was invited to the party by East Lancashire MP, Andrew Stephenson.

He defected from Labour earlier this year and was welcomed by the Conservatives - despite the party knowing of the allegations against him.

Mr Aziz has always denied involvement in the murder and has said he was in Britain at the time.

The UK has no extradition treaty with Pakistan so he would have to travel there willingly to be under risk of arrest.

Mr Aziz told his local paper after the Eid party on October 21: 'I was proud to see the Prime Minister and enjoyed myself, really. I shook hands with him and he welcomed me.

‘We had a great chat with Andrew Stephenson, too, and we thank him that he recommended us to be invited by the Prime Minister. It was great.’

He is listed on a document that names four men Pakistani police wish to speak to in relation to the murder of Muhammad Ilyas in the village of Domian on May last year, just days after he was elected to the council.

Mr Ilyas was shot in the stomach and arm after four armed men burst into his house.

Mr Aziz said last month when the allegations surfaced: ‘I don’t know who has accused me or why I am named. It’s the first time I have seen the document.

‘This is an incident that has devastated my family. It can only be to stop me going back to Pakistan to see my family and to help out. People don’t realise that this is my family. It is my cousin who has died.

‘In all my life I have never been in argument or aggressive. This has nothing to do with me.’

Meeting: The PM met Mr Aziz, whose name is listed on a document published by website Political Scrapbook, during an Eid celebration

The arrest warrant - published by the Political Scrapbook website and translated from Urdu - describes the incident was a ‘revenge’ killing ‘done on the hook of Abdul Aziz’.

It lists 19 supposed witnesses but does not name Mr Aziz as one of the gunmen in the description of the incident.

It is alleged four men, armed with a 30 bore pistol and a 44 bore rifle, entered a house at around 5pm on May 1, 2012, and shot Mr Ilyas in the stomach and arm.

Labour MP Graham Jones has written to the Conservative Party chairman Grant Shapps, querying why the Prime Minister met Mr Aziz while police want to speak to him.

Mr Jones said there were ‘serious allegations’ which involved an arrest warrant for Mr Aziz.

He asked whether ‘security arrangements at 10 Downing Street are adequate’ when assessing visitors.

Mr Jones, the MP for Haslingden and Hyburn, wrote: ‘Was Number 10 aware that Mr Aziz was wanted in connection with this incident?

'Do you think Councillor Aziz should still be a member of the Conservative Party whilst such questions remain?

'Do you think it is acceptable to the victim’s family that one of the people named on the arrest warrant should be invited to Downing Street and shake hands with the Prime Minister?’

He also queried whether the Conservative party had conducted its own investigation into the allegations.

A spokesman for Mr Shapps declined to comment, simply pointing to earlier statements made to the press by Mr Aziz.

A spokesman for the Prime Minister said: ‘We don’t comment on security issues. His explanation for the allegations is there.’

Mr Aziz did not respond to the Mail’s request for a comment.
