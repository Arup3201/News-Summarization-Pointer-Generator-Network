After her month-long imprisonment in a Chinese jail late last year, Sydney woman Kalynda Davis' life appears to have returned to normal.

Ms Davis was arrested at Guangzhou International Airport in southern China on November 8, along with travel companion Peter Gardner, 25, and the pair were accused of smuggling 'ice' - the drug crystal methamphetamine.

They had met in dating app Tinder weeks earlier and decided to take a last-minute trip to China before heading back home. 

Ms Davis, 22, from western Sydney has spent the summer catching up with friends, spending time at the beach while showing off her short haircut - one that was forced upon her while imprisoned.

Social media photos show Ms Davis enjoying the sunshine, much of it with her best friend Dan Stella, who posted a touching tribute to the friend with which who he shares a 'magical bond' with.

'I'm blessed n thankfull I have this girl back home n in my life, best friends for life (sic)', he wrote earlier this month.

Mr Stella went on to describe the emotion he felt when he discovered he may never see Ms Davis again, saying he felt truly 'blessed' to have her back.

The pair visited Naru Beach in Newcastle together in the first week of 2015, with Ms Davis joking she wanted to forget how sunburnt she was after spending the day in the sun.

Mr Stella likened Ms Davis' return to 'winning the lottery' to which she replied 'love you so much' and 'Makes each time we spend together so much more special'.

A video montage of pictures of the pair was also uploaded by Mr Stella, alongside a caption which read in part 'endless smile on my face ... #tearsofhappiness'.

Friends of the young woman from Glenmore Park have taken to her page to say hello, wish her a happy new year,  or express their relief that she is safe and sound and moving forward with her life after the ordeal.

She has also since returned to her job as an employee of Cover-More Insurance, Fairfax reported.

Ms Davis and Mr Gardner met overseas on dating app Tinder late last year, before deciding to take a last minute-trip to China.

A New Zealand citizen, Mr Gardner has lived in Australia for some time, having completed his apprenticeship at a western Sydney construction firm.

He could still face the death penalty by firing squad for allegedly attempting to traffic 30 kilograms of methamphetamine. 

Just following his daughter's release, Ms Davis' father Larry gave a heartfelt interview to The Western Weekender, describing the anguish he went through while she was away.

Ms Davis has returned to her job at an insurance company according to reports 

 

'I don’t know what I have been feeling. It is like I have been brain-dead. Think of a parent’s worst nightmare and multiply it by ten,' he told the publication.

'Her and I are close, as close as any father and daughter could be. I never once thought that she had done anything wrong.'

‘I knew she was so innocent. I prayed every night that the truth would come out… We found out that she was being released on Friday (December 5) night.

‘We cried and cried and cried and cried and I don’t think I had more than four hours sleep after that until last night, when she was home safely,’ he added to the newspaper. 

Ms Davis' friend Dan Stella had previously posted about the Sydney woman's return, writing he was thankful she was home with loved ones

The same week Kaylnda's parents - father Larry and mother Jennifer - told reporters they were pleased and relieved Kalynda was free and safe following her month-long ordeal in Guangzhou.

In a statement, they said: 'We are happy to have Kalynda back home. We have always known Kalynda to be innocent of these allegations.'

'Her return home today is a clear statement of her innocence.'

'We have received so much support from family and friends. We thank everyone for the support we have received during the last month.'
