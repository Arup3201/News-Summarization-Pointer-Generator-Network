He might have taken the title at Wimbledon but Andy Murray's luck ran out yesterday after he crashed out of the US Open with girlfriend Kim Sears looking on.

The 25-year-old bit her lip and looked grim-faced as Murray lost 6-4 6-3 6-2 to Switzerland's world number nine, Stanislas Wawrinka.

Behind her, Murray's formidable mother Judy looked increasingly irate as the match went on and was left holding her head in consternation as the British number one conceded defeat.

Glum: Kim, who wore a £199 Ted Baker dress, looked increasingly concerned as the match drew to a close

Irate: Andy's mother Judy looked thoroughly displeased at the result and was covering her eyes by the end

Despite the on-court catastrophe, Kim was her usual stylish self in a cream scallop-neck lace dress, the £199 Lucya from Ted Baker, which she paired with a stylish pair of Ray-Ban sunglasses.

Judy, meanwhile, plumped for a low-key charcoal camisole which she paired with a grey cap and one of her trademark charm bracelets.

Kim has made almost as many headlines as her other half this week, thanks to her stellar sense of style.

Thrifty Kim has developed a reputation 
for making low-cost high street buys look a million dollars and the last seven days have been no exception.

On Tuesday, she wore an elegant cobalt blue top and a floral necklace from high street favourite Zara, and while on Sunday she was seen toting a chic £329 bag from Ted Baker.

Distraught: Andy couldn't hide his disappointment at being knocked out of the tournament

Tense: Andy lost the match to the Swiss player in straight sets

Looking on: Virgin supremo Richard Branson watched the match alongside swimwear model Jelena Ristic

Not amused: Amanda Seyfried seemed to enjoy the match but Sean Connery appeared glum

Although elegant Kim was left looking glum, she and Judy Murray weren't the only famous faces spotted watching the action.

Fellow Scot Sean Connery looked grim as he watched the match unfold, 
while Tommy Lee Jones looked in good spirits as he smiled and laughed 
with a female companion.

Virgin
boss Richard Branson was also spotted courtside, sittling alongside 
Novak Djokovic's swimwear model girlfriend, Jelena Ristic.

Other famous faces included Lovelace star Amanda Seyfried who looked relaxed in a loose black t-shirt and skinny denim jeans.
