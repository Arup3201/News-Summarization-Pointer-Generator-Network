Vladimir Putin wants to see the independent state of Ukraine wiped off the map, the country’s interim prime minister claimed yesterday.

As fresh clashes erupted in Odessa and across the east of the country, pro-Western Arseniy Yatsenyuk blamed Moscow’s secret services for dozens killed in a fire in the city on Friday.

‘What happened in Odessa was part of a plan by the Russian Federation to destroy Ukraine and its statehood,’ Mr Yatsenyuk alleged. ‘Russia sent people here to create chaos,’ he added.

He went on to beg Ukrainians to bury their differences ‘so as not to give the terrorists backed by Moscow the opportunity to divide our people’.

Further violence engulfed the country over the weekend. In the eastern city of Mariupol, pro-Russian forces tricked soldiers into eating food laced with a sleeping potion before taking them hostage on Saturday.

Some 2,000 pro-Moscow activists stormed the Odessa police HQ in the normally easygoing Black Sea resort, shouting ‘fascists, fascists’ and ‘Russia won’t abandon its own’ as they demanded the release of almost 130 ‘comrades’ arrested for bloody unrest in which 42 were killed.

After forcing their way into the yard and smashing windows, the authorities caved in and released some 30 of the detainees.

Engulfed by violence which is rapidly plunging Ukraine into full-scale civil war, the bespectacled Yatsenyuk begged his people to unite and to bury their differences ‘so as not to give the terrorists backed by Moscow the opportunity to divide our people’.

Russia had a very different take on it, with one senior figure demanding that Kiev’s leaders should be hauled before the International Criminal Court in The Hague over the Odessa ‘massacre’ in which pro-Russians were killed.

Senior MP Mikhail Markelov warned ‘that Yugoslavia’s fate is in store for Ukraine’, referring to the years of ethnically-fuelled bloodshed that scarred the Balkans.

Yatsenyuk countered by accusing Putin of a plan ‘to repeat in Odessa what is happening in the east of the country’.

He spoke in Odessa, in Ukraine’s south, which was founded by Russian empress Catherine the Great, and is seen by some as a key target for Russia in seeking to grab territory stretching from pro-Moscow eastern areas to the Moldovan enclave of Transnistria which will this week make a new bid to be subsumed into the Kremlin empire.

But he was also critical of his police, firing all commanders on Odessa for failing to protect people and failing to counter ‘terrorist forces’.

‘There were dozens of casualties resulting from a well prepared and organised action against people, against Ukraine and against Odessa,’ said Yatsenyuk, whose government is being closely aided by operatives from the CIA and FBI according to German sources.

At the weekend, Putin’s entourage revealed he had received ‘thousands’ of calls for help from Ukrainians.

He has already secured permission from the Russian parliament to use military forces in Ukraine, and has as many as 65,000 in Russia and annexed Ukraine, where there was a show of aerial force - strategic bombers and fighter jets - at the weekend.

In Mariupol, embarrassed troop commanders revealed that donations of food were spiked.

‘It turned out that the food contained a substance that induced sleep among the servicemen,’ the acting head of Mariupol criminal police department, Alexei Paniotov, said.

‘After about half an hour, about 20 unidentified people arrived in three cars and, taking advantage of their helpless state, took them prisoner along with four automatic rifles, a grenade launcher, a machine gun and ammunition.’

They were held overnight before being released yesterday.

Ukraine faces acute tests in the next week as two regions - Donetsk and Lugansk - stage ‘illegal’ referendums which could see them splitting permanently from Ukraine.

Western intelligence suspects that Russia is engaged in a plan to re-take vast swathes of Ukraine which in tsarist times were called ‘Novorossiya’, or New Russia, stretching from Kharkov in the north-east to Odessa in the south-west as well as Transitria in the west.

Under such a scenario, Ukraine would have its east and south lopped off and become a rump state cut off entirely from the Black Sea, with all the industrial muscle and port cities falling to the Kremlin.

In February, before Crimea was annexed, a mysterious internet petition in Russia called on Putin to invade ‘Novorossiya’ - and met with overwhelming approval. After 100,000 signed, it was dramatically withdrawn with no traces left on the web but now there is suspicion that it revealed a Kremlin plan.

In his TV question and answer session three weeks ago, Putin dropped another hint.

‘Novorossiya - Kharkov, Lugansk, Donetsk, and Odessa were not part of Ukraine in Tsarist times,’ he said. ‘They were transferred in 1920 [after the Bolshevik Revolution]. Why? God knows.’

Ukrainian forces were last night said to be surrounding Sloviansk amid expectations its troops were planning to storm the city to free it from control by pro-Russian militants.
