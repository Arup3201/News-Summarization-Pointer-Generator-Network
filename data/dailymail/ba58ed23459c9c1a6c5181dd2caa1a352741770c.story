IT glitch: RBS Chief Executive Stephen Hester said he was sorry for the difficulties customers were facing

Stephen Hester, boss of NatWest owner RBS, tonight personally apologised for the technical glitches that have left the bank in chaos.

The chief executive said 1,200 branches would be opened nationwide tomorrow morning to tackle the problems caused by faulty computer software.

Mr Hester admitted that NatWest had let down its customers after hundreds of people vented their anger over the issue.

The IT glitch has led to payments going missing, wages disappearing and holidays and home purchases being disrupted.

Account balances were not updated properly overnight, meaning credit and debit payments were not showing up as quickly as they should.

In a statement released tonight, Mr Hester said: 'I am very sorry for the difficulties people are experiencing.

'Our customers rely on us day in and day out to get things right, and on this occasion we have let them down.

'This should not have happened.

'Right now my top priority, and the priority of the entire RBS Group, is to fix these problems and put things right for our customers.

'This is taking time, but I want to reassure people that we are working around the clock to resolve these problems as quickly as we are able.'

Mr Hester, who owns a £7million home and earns £1.2m a year, bowed to pressure and declined a £963,000 bonus last month.

Empty wallets: NatWest cashpoints across the country were left out of order because of 'technical difficulties'

NatWest - owned by taxpayer-funded RBS -
admitted the breakdown resulted in money credited to customers accounts
overnight not appearing in their balances 'as it should'.

In some cases people were left homeless after the computer problems meant house purchases fell through.

The bank said: 'We appreciate this has caused an unacceptable level of inconvenience.

'We have fixed the initial problem and our priority has been to work round the clock to sort the backlog as soon as possible.'

Today over 900 branches extended their opening hours until 6pm and they will open again from 9am until 12pm tomorrow to cope with emergencies.

Frustrations: Branches will open tomorrow to deal with problems including unpaid wages and disrupted mortgage payments

Others were stranded abroad, unable to access funds which should have been in their account.

Frustrated customers said the bank's response was not good enough, with some vowing to take their business away.

The problem arose after staff tried to install a software update on RBS’s payment processing system, but ended up corrupting it.

When checking their accounts on Wednesday many customers found their balances had not updated properly to show new payments in. This meant those relying on wages being paid in were unable to pay their mortgage and other bills.

Anger: NatWest allowed customers to post their 'feedback' on their website - and people were using it to record their disgust

Three days later, many of those payments have still not appeared – meaning thousands of customers are now likely to have been hit by penalty charges for missing the payments.

Although the banking group has promised that no one will be out of pocket as a result of the problems, it may take weeks to clear the backlog of claims.

The problems have hit 7.5million personal customers, many business customers and 100,000 customers of Ulster Bank.

Messaging boards were flooded yesterday with complaints from those who were unable to access wages or who had their cards declined in shops.
