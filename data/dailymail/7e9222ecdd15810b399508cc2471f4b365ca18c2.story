Margaret Thatcher in a sheer strapless top and leopard-print bra, Winston Churchill in a pork pie hat and John F Kennedy with a hoop earring and a hipster haircut - these are world leaders as we have never imagined them before.

Israeli artist Amit Shimoni created the  series, depicting global political icons in the most improbable way possible, outfitted and styled in the latest hipster fashions.

The  illustrator said he hopes to 'encourage us to reflect upon our leaders, our society, and ourselves' with his new set of unlikely artworks.

Winston Churchill, who led Britain through WW2, sports a sartorial sailor look with braces and porkpie hat

The illustrator mixes the modern hipster culture of today's youth with history's greatest, most iconic leaders for the Hipstory series.

The subjects are seen against solid pastel backgrounds and in place of power suits, expensive haircuts and clean-shaven faces, Shimoni's world leaders sport piercings, moustaches and edgy, street fashions.

They are a far cry from posed official photographs or stately  portraits in which  leaders are presented soberly dressed.

Great war leader and Nobel Prize-winner Winston Churchill is given a sartorial sailor look, with a Breton-striped T-shirt with a plunging neckline, braces, pork pie hat and cigarette behind one ear.

Even if the leader depicted has died, the pictures in Hipstory aim to include elements that echo something about its subject.

John F Kennedy dons a nose ring, chains and a T-shirt bearing, what appears to be, a black and white image of Marilyn Monroe.

Mahatma Gandhi, meanwhile, wears a tie-dye top and Sixties-style shades to reflect his peaceful politics.

Meanwhile, South Africa's Nelson Mandela's hipster makeover involves a stylised flat top hair style with a tropical print bomber jacket and gold hoop earring.

Abraham Lincoln wears an ironic purple velour blazer with a gold jewellery, while the USSR's Vladimir Lenin sports ear 'spacers' and a studded jacket.

'I often find myself thinking about the differences between these world's greatest leaders, their beliefs and motivations, and our self-centered generation,' Shimoni said.

'The Y Generation is constantly looking at fashion and style as their way of self-expression while steering away from the big ideologies.

It's hard to imagine Russian communist icon Vladimir Lenin, who died in 1924, as a fan of studded jackets

'Hipstory wishes to reimagine the great leaders of modern history and place them in a different time and culture - ours. 

'It was not easy to illustrate all these leaders; it took me a few months to complete the project, but the effort was worth it. 

'It is my hope that this series will encourage us to reflect: upon our leaders, our society, and ourselves.

'Hipstory wishes not to criticise, but to shed new light on the way we think of ourselves and the figures who inspire us.'
