A ‘sadistic’ father has been ordered to spend the rest of his life in prison for murdering his ex-partner and their two-year-old daughter in a jealous rage.

David Oakes, 50, stormed Christine Chambers’ house and blasted her and their daughter Shania with a shotgun just weeks after the family gained a restraining order against him.

Beforehand, he subjected Miss Chambers to ‘degrading assaults’ by forcing her to strip and cutting chunks from her hair. He then wounded his face with the gun himself following the attack last June.

His were so grave that Essex Police have refused to release his arresting mugshot because it was 'too graphic'.

Instead they released a photo of Oakes, who had a history of violent attacks against his former partner, taken following an earlier arrest.

Officers refused to reveal what he was held for on that occasion.

Last month the former nightclub bouncer admitted bringing a bottle of petrol, a drill and an axe round to the house late at night following a drunken night playing pool at a local pub but not to murder.

But today at Chelmsford Crown Court a 
jury of seven men and six women found Oakes, of Steeple, Essex, guilty 
of two counts of murder after nearly nine hours of deliberation.

Mr Justice Fulford ordered Oakes to 
serve a whole life sentence for the ‘sadistic’ killings, meaning he will
never be released from prison.

Mr Justice Fulford

He said: ‘These tragic and needless deaths occurred in deeply shocking circumstances.

‘A bullying and controlling man, who 
had frequently inflicted violence on Miss Chambers during the six years 
of their relationship, killed his ex-partner and their young daughter 
simply because he knew she could not bear to be with him and wished to 
start a new life.’

The judge added that Miss Chambers ‘carried not a shred of blame’ for what happened.

‘Instead of thinking of his daughter 
who he has claimed to love, he concentrated on himself alone and most 
particularly his desire for revenge and his determination that no other 
man was going to be Christine's partner or act as Shania's father,’ the 
judge added.

‘He resolved that, if the family was 
at an end, that they would pay for leaving him with their lives and that
their last hours of live would be terrifying and, in the case of 
Christine Chambers, extremely painful.’

The judge said Oakes ‘planned the 
deaths in elaborate detail’ and took with him a series of implements to 
inflict pain on Miss Chambers during the attack at her home in Braintree.

He made her beg and proclaim her love for him while at the same time ‘torturing’ her, the judge added.

Miss Chambers' family wept as the 
judge said: ‘Shania would have witnessed her mother's gravely injured 
state and heard her cries for help. She would have seen the appalling 
injuries to her mother.

‘That little girl must have been terrified.

‘He then put the shotgun against her head and pulled the trigger.

‘No decent, civilised human being could ever describe that as being the result of love.’

Oakes did not appear in court to be sentenced.

Richard Connolly, in mitigation, said
his client's absence for the verdict and sentencing was ‘not intended 
to show disrespect to the court, jury or the verdicts that have been 
passed’.

He added prison guards had been 
concerned for Oakes's safety because he ‘expressed emotions’ which made 
them fear he may harm himself.

Andrew Jackson, junior prosecution counsel, read an excerpt from a statement by Miss Chambers' family.

It said: ‘The tragic loss of Chrissie and Shania has deeply impacted on all of our everyday lives.

‘No parents should have to outlive their child, let alone grandchild.’

Miss Chambers' 10-year-old daughter 
with former partner Ian Flitt witnessed the attack but escaped out of 
the bedroom window to her father's house nearby.

Mr Jackson said the 10 year old - Shania's half-sister - had suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder ever since.

Oakes had some ‘old and trivial’ 
previous convictions committed ‘within the context of his relationship 
with Christine Chambers’, he added.

Chris McCann, head of the Crown 
Prosecution Service's East of England complex case unit, said outside 
court: ‘This was an extremely violent and horrifying assault by Oakes 
upon Miss Chambers in advance of a family court hearing over access to 
Shania and driven by a determination that he would kill both Christine 
and Shania before attempting to kill himself.

‘Our thoughts are obviously with the family of Miss Chambers who behaved in such a dignified way throughout the trial.’
