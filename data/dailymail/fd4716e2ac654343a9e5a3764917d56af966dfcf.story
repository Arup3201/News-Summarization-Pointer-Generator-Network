Tragic: Alexander Denk, 26, from Munich, was found eight days after he died in his room in Cardiff

A university student lay dead in his room for eight days until his worried family raised the alarm.

Alexander Denk, 26, was living with eight University of Wales undergraduates in a shared house when he mysteriously died in early November.

But he went undetected for more than a week until his family became concerned that they had not heard from him.

Police forced their way into his locked room in Roath, Cardiff, on November 8 and found his body.

The German-born student was last seen on October 31, an inquest heard.

Due to the time lapse, pathologist Gareth Leopold said the circumstances of death were unclear.

He told Cardiff Coroner's Court Mr Denk could have been a victim of Sudden Adult Death Syndrome.

Drinking too much caffeine to stay awake could have also been a factor, Mr Leopold said, adding: 'Consuming a large amount of caffeine has been known to cause death by a condition called arrhythmia, in which the heart beats too fast.'

Sudden Adult Death Syndrome, known in medical circles as Sudden Arrhythmia Death Syndrome, is the term given to an unexplained heart attack in healthy adults, also linked to so-called 'cot deaths'.

Alexander moved to Cardiff from Munich last year to study for his masters degree in international business management at the University of South Wales.

Undetected: Mr Denk lived in a house in Roath, Cardiff, with other students

Unexplained: Pathologist Gareth Leopold said the delay meant the cause of death is difficult to determine

Hard worker: His father, Raimund, paid tribute to Alexander, who worked hard on his MA at the University of Wales and loved sports

His father Raimund last saw his son at home in Munich in August, and spoke to him on the phone on October 29.

He said: 'I knew he had a lot of pressure in relation to his studies and I told him he should take care of himself. He was very ambitious.'

Coroner Thomas Atherton recorded an open verdict.
