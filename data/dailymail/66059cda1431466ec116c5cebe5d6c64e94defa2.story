Injured: Stewart Jackson MP claimed he was attacked while trying to perform a citizen's arrest

A man is due in court tomorrow charged with a string of offences after a Tory MP was injured when challenging an alleged bus shelter vandal.

Ivans Karanovs, 20, will appear before magistrates in Peterborough accused of criminal damage, common assault, and using threatening words and behaviour.

Backbencher Stewart Jackson said he tried to make a citizen's arrest on Saturday after seeing a man smash the glass with a bottle.

However, the alleged culprit fled after kicking him in the chest.

Mr Jackson, who had been shopping with his wife and daughter in his Peterborough constituency, posted about the incident on Twitter.

'Had set to with violent thug kicking in bus shelter in Broadway & suffered kick in side for pains,' he wrote.

He said: 'I was walking past and couldn't just ignore it...That's when I put my shopping down and went on up and said, "You can't do that'."

The MP added: 'I just felt, I live there, it is my city, it is my constituency.

'When you tolerate that the next thing is that they are smashing up people's faces.'

The civic-minded MP's actions provoked a mixed reaction from his Twitter followers.

‏@orderlyplayer
 asked whether Mr Jackson should have let police handle the incident, 
tweeting: '@SJacksonMP perhaps you should have had some sense and call 
the police before you went in all guns blazing!'

But other users on the social network were quick to back Mr Jackson.

Daniel Hill, tweeting under the name ‏@IRDanIeL said: '@SJacksonMP Great to see you taking a stand. Hope you're okay!'
