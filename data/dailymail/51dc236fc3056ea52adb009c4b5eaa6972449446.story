Nurse Amber Vinson has beaten Ebola. 

The Texas health care worker, who contracted the deadly virus while treating 'patient zero' Thomas Eric Duncan, has been officially declared Ebola free and will be released from Emory University Hospital in Atlanta later today. 

Her remarkable recovery comes exactly two weeks after she was admitted to Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital with the disease hours after flying from Ohio to Dallas. 

Ms Vinson, 29, is the second Dallas nurse who caught Ebola from Duncan and the second to recover. Last week, her colleague Nina Pham was cured and released from the hospital.

Recovered: Doctors at Emory University Hospital in Atlanta have declared Amber Vinson free of Ebola just two weeks after she was admitted

Even as Ms Vinson steps out in public, dozens of people who came into contact with her - including her family and passengers on her October 13 Cleveland to Dallas flight - remain fearful that they could still come down with Ebola from contact with her.

She sparked panic across Northeast Ohio when it emerged that she had visited her family in Cleveland and Akron while possibly contagious. School closed, a bridal shop she visited has had to undergo a deep cleaning to lure customers back and some members of her family remain in voluntary quarantine. 

She boarded the Frontier Airlines flight with the blessing of public health officials, even though she had a low-grade fever at the time. Local health officials have ordered the 132 passengers on her flight to regularly monitor their temperatures to signs of fever - the first symptom of Ebola. 

So far no one has been diagnosed with Ebola from contact with Ms Vinson and health officials say the chances of exposure are 'very low.' However, the 21-day incubation period for the disease still has not passed.  

Ms Vinson was flown to Emory University Hospital in Atlanta the same day she was diagnosed with Ebola at Texas Presbyterian Hospital in Dallas

Ms Vinson's family announced last Wednesday that the virus could no longer be detected in her body. Doctors are now confident she had beaten the disease after keeping her under observation for six more days. 

She was admitted to Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital, where she works, on October 14. She was diagnosed the next day and flown to Emory's hospital for treatment. 

Ms Vinson handled Duncan's blood and other bodily fluids - transmitters of Ebola - while he was under care at Texas Presbyterian. However, hospital officials say she and Ms Pham took CDC-recommended precautions. It is still not clear how she contracted the disease. 

Ms Vinson is the eighth person treated for Ebola in the United States. Only Duncan, a Liberian national who died on October 8, has not survived the disease. 

Dr Craig Spencer, a New York health worker who volunteered in Ebola-ravaged Guinea, is the only person currently being treated for the disease in America. He is in serious condition at Bellvue Hospital in Manhattan.
