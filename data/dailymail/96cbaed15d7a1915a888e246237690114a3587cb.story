Dr Sharad Shripadrao Pandit told an inquest he denies telling Alina Sarag's family her illness was 'all in her head.'

A 15-year-old schoolgirl died of tuberculosis after a series of doctor errors missed the chance to detect and cure her disease, with her GP claiming she was 'lovesick', an inquest heard today.

Alina Sarag died in January last year after a GP allegedly advised her that her physical deterioration was due to mental health problems.

The teenager’s father, Sultan Sarag, told Birmingham Coroner’s Court his daughter was told she needed to see a psychiatrist or even a spiritual healer.

Alina's parents called her GP more than 50 times about their daughter’s ailing condition over a four-and-a-half month period before her death.

She was also seen by more than five doctors at four different hospitals but medics failed to detect the curable disease.

Her distraught father, broke down as he told the court: 'The doctor said to her ‘Did you meet someone on holiday? Are you missing him?

'She found it very distressing he was suggesting she was lovesick for a boy.

'He said all the problems were in her head and she should see a psychiatrist or spiritual healer.'

Mr Sarag also claimed Dr Sharad Shripadrao Pandit accused him of 'mollycoddling' Alina, and refused to test his daughter for TB.

He told the inquest: 'He said: "We don’t need these tests, we are not going to get them done either."'

Alina was told by her GP that she may have bulimia and would need to see a psychiatrist, the inquest heard.

Giving his version of the disputed conversation concerning his recommendation that Alina should see a psychologist, Dr Pandit said it had not taken place in the teenager's presence.

'I did not do that in front of Alina at all. She was terribly young, she was 15,' he said. 'She went to the car with her father and I asked her mother to wait.

'I wanted information from the parents, particularly the mother.'

Today on the fourth day of the inquest at Birmingham Coroners Court, Dr Pandit said he 'fully accepted' TB did not 'cross my mind' despite knowing she had previously been struck down with the disease in 2009.

But he denied telling her family her illness was 'all in her head.'

Dr Pandit said: 'There was never any discussion about TB or sign of TB. It did not match her symptoms. I fully accept TB did not cross my mind.'

'Every time she [Alina] came to see me she walked into the surgery unaided and she never looked unwell. I would not have recorded her condition as ‘normal’ if she had not seemed so.

'She never presented to me with a cough or night sweats. I would not have behaved in a threatening way to her father as her family have suggested. I would not have told them it was all in her head.'

'I would not have behaved in a threatening way to her father as her family have suggested.

'I would not have told them it was all in her head.'

At the conclusion of his evidence, Dr Pandit said that, as a GP, he still did not know what else could have been done to save Alina's life.

The long-serving doctor, who heads the Highgate practice, also attempted to offer his condolences to Alina's family, prompting them to walk out of the courtroom.

Another GP at the Highgate surgery, Dr Khalid Iqbal, told the coroner he believed Alina did not have active TB when he assessed her on four dates in September and October 2010.

Dr Iqbal eventually referred Alina to Birmingham Children's Hospital but did not pass on details of her previous history of latent TB in his referral letter.

'I don't think she had active TB at the time,' the doctor said. 'None of the symptoms were suggesting that she had TB.'

Mr Sarag - who is also being treated for TB - told the inquest his daughter vomited up to 10 times a day and had to be carried to bed 'like an old woman with weak legs'.

'I would spend hours rubbing her back, arms, head and neck to try and help ease her pain,' he said.

He added that he made more than 50 phone calls to the GP’s surgery in Birmingham but Dr Pandit failed to return his calls.

Mr Sarag said: 'There was mass neglect. The medical profession, as soon as they mess up they hide.'

Alina first contracted TB in 2009 after a girl at her school was diagnosed with the illness.

She was prescribed a course of antibiotics at Birmingham Chest Clinic but medical staff never followed up her treatment.

Alina was struck down again in July 2010 after returning from a trip to Pakistan with her family.

The inquest heard a simple phlegm test would have shown Alina was suffering from TB but this was never carried out.

Instead, doctors shrugged off her family’s concerns and told them Alina was suffering from a chest infection despite being classed as a 'high risk' patient.

Alina’s weight plummeted and at one point she was so ill she could only tolerate baby food.

After doctors at Heartland and City hospitals did not detect TB, Alina was admitted to Sandwell Hospital where she stayed for five days.

TB was picked up but no phlegm test was carried out and a chest X-ray was thought to have found a chest infection.

She later saw a clinical psychologist at Birmingham Children’s Hospital but was in too much pain to complete the assessment.

On January 6, 2011 Alina was rushed to hospital after suffering breathing difficulties and she died of a cardiac arrest.

The hearing continues.
