Manchester United have been stunned after Real Madrid demanded a British record fee of £75million for Angel Di Maria.

The Argentina international has made the European champions aware that Old Trafford is his preferred destination and said goodbyes to his team-mates on Saturday with United growing increasingly confident of clinching a deal but the price-tag has come as a shock.

They had expected a valuation of up to £56m, similar to the figures discussed by rivals Paris St Germain last week, but Madrid, sensing United's desperation to land a stellar signing, have upped the price.

The deal is not off but, with a week left in the window, it leaves United battling against time to barter down to a figure they believe is more acceptable.

Madrid's president Florentino Perez sees Di Maria as their best chance to redress their summer spending and the 26-year-old's departure would also allow them to bring in another non-EU player in Radamel Falcao from Monaco.

They know United have money to spend and want to use that to squeeze out as much as possible.

It would represent a huge profit on the £20m they paid Benfica for Di Maria in 2010 and, coupled with his £180,000 a week wages, represent a huge outlay for United - smashing the current British record of Chelsea's £50m for Fernando Torres in 2011.

Madrid coach Carlo Ancelotti has confirmed Di Maria said goodbye to his team-mates ahead of the impending move.

'Di Maria has not trained with us today and he came in to say goodbye to the players and people at the club,' Ancelotti told a news conference in Madrid.

'There is nothing official yet but it is being sorted out. The decision is his and the club has done what it could to keep him here.'

Time is up: Di Maria is expected to be a Manchester United player if the club can agree a fee with Real Madrid

The two clubs meanwhile are also in discussions over a deal for United's young right-back Guillermo Varela.

The 21-year-old was David Moyes's first official signing from Penarol for £1.75m but Madrid want him to join up with Zinedine Zidane and their B team Castilla. They have asked for a loan which could become a permanent £4m deal.
