Dramatic footage of an alleged teenage terrorist testing a Molotov cocktail behind a leisure centre was shown at the Old Bailey today.

Neo-Nazi Michael Piggin, 18, asked friends to film him hurling the homemade bomb at a wall where he had spray-painted the phrase 'no more mosques', the court heard.

Jurors were shown the mobile phone clip of the incident, where Piggin faces the camera while grasping the flaming bomb made from a wine bottle.

Another video shows the defendant spraying the anti-Islamic message on the leisure centre wall in Loughborough.

Piggin is on trial accused of plotting a 'new Columbine' massacre at a school and college, as well as formulating attacks on mosques, local shops, a cinema and council offices.

He kept detailed notes of his plans in a Che Guevara notebook adorned with racist epithets and Nazi symbols, the court heard.

Police found a Swastika flag on his bedroom wall and a cache of weapons including homemade pipe bombs, a crossbow, air rifles, and knifes next to his bed among books on notorious mass murderers.

One of Piggin's old classmates said he alienated fellow pupils by spouting racial abuse and declaring his support for the British National Party and the IRA.

The Asian teenager, now 17, who cannot be named for legal reasons, said they were friends when they first met in September 2011, but fell out in May 2012.

Gesture: After throwing the suspected bomb and setting part of the wall alight, he turns to the camera

Organisation: The accused teenager is said to have plotted a Columbine-style massacre at a school and college

'I heard him call me a P*ki a few times, and then I got told through other friends that were in some of his lessons that he was quite a big racist', he said.

'He said offensive things to teachers and he was uncontrollable. When it was the beginning of exams, he was saying I wasn't British because my family wasn't born here.'

The witness described an incident when Piggin flew into a rage while they were playing football and he was accidentally tripped up.

'He got quite wound up and he just started going really mad, raging at the person', he said. 'He started calling him names and threatening him.

Graffiti: More footage shows the defendant allegedly spraying 'No more mosques' on the wall

Suspected: He wrote the anti-Islamic slogans on the wall next to a footpath behind a leisure centre in Loughborough

Apparel: Wearing a cap and carrying a shoulder bag, the court saw the defendant stepping back from the wall

'After that, he would say to people "You better watch your back, I've got guns".'

He added: 'People got really sick of him, because he is really racist.'

The boy said Piggin smashed a display cabinet in school when another pupil questioned the deployment of British troops.

'At the beginning he seemed like a nice, decent guy', he said. 'But then throughout the year he acted up a bit, saying he supported certain types of terrorist groups like the IRA and the EDL. And he was quite racist as well.'

The court heard how Piggin detailed the plans in a notebook with Che Guevara on the front

'He was in quite a few of my lessons, and I saw him change in character.

'I didn't think he was a right person to hang around with so I stopped speaking to him.'

Jurors have been shown Piggin's alleged 'hit list' from his notebook, including teachers, pupils, and other people he held a grudge against.

Prosecutor Max Hill QC told the court this witness 'appears at number two on that list'.

Piggin's notes also include his plans for 'Project New Columbine' and his ideas for his Urban Revolutionary Army.

Piggin and two other 18-year-old boys, who cannot be named, have already admitted possessing petrol bombs and pipe bombs.

But Piggin, an Asperger's sufferer, denies he was planning a terrorist attack.

Piggin denies possessing articles for a purpose connected with terrorism and possession of a document or a record containing information of a kind likely to be useful to a person committing or preparing an act of terrorism on or before 19 February 2013.

The trial continues.
