Rafael Nadal was brought back down to earth with a bump by Dustin Brown in Halle.

Four days after winning the French Open for a record ninth time, Nadal lost his opening match on the grass 6-4 6-1 in less than an hour.

Brown, the flamboyant and big hitting Jamaican-German, was not the man Nadal would have wanted to meet as he tried to find his feet on the grass.

Bags packed: Rafael Nadal did not last long at Halle, losing to Dustin Brown in straight sets

War cry: Brown beat Nadal 6-4, 6-1 in less than an hour

Hands up: Brown, ranked 85th, made light work of world No 1 Nadal

Serial winner: Nadal claimed a ninth French Open at Roland Garros on Sunday

The world No 1 looked to have adjusted well in the first set but Brown, who beat Lleyton Hewitt at Wimbledon last year, broke serve in the 10th game and did not look back.

In the opening five games of the second set, Nadal won just five points and, although he stopped the rot eventually, 85th-ranked Brown confidently served out the best win of his life.

Nadal had said before leaving Paris that his expectations for Halle were not high but, having won just one match in two years at Wimbledon, it is hardly ideal preparation.

Low key: Nadal had said his hopes for success in Halle were not high

Room for improvement: Nadal has only won one game at Wimbledon in the last two years

Defending champion Roger Federer avoided the same fate but did have a scare against Portugal's Joao Sousa.

Second seed Federer lost the opening set on a tie-break but recovered to win 6-7 (8/10) 6-4 6-2.

The Swiss was in a positive mood after the match, saying on the ATP's official website: 'It was slightly frustrating at times clearly, but nevertheless I served well and kept on doing my thing.

'It was important to stay calm and actually I think it gives me more confidence winning this way. I had to stay calm, fight through the match and find a way and then the last set and a half were much better. So, I'm actually pretty happy now.'

Federer next meets Lu Yen-hsun, who defeated Ivo Karlovic in two tie-breaks, while American Steve Johnson was given a walkover into the quarter-finals by Teymuraz Gabashvili.

Defending champion: Roger Federer won in Halle last year and progressed after beating Joao Sousa

Winning mentality: The second seed saw off his Portuguese opponent in three sets, 6-7 (8/10) 6-4 6-2

Next on the agenda: Federer will now face Lu Yen-hsun in the next round of the tournament
