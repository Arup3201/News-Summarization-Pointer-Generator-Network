Paul Downton was forced to apologise 
to Kevin Pietersen on Friday night when lawyers decided that the 
managing director had breached the confidentiality agreement reached 
when England sacked their maverick star.

Downton
 had provided the most detailed and welcome explanation yet behind the 
decision to sever ties with Pietersen after the Ashes disaster in an 
interview last week with Jonathan Agnew on BBC’s Test Match Special.

Hitting back: Kevin Pietersen rejected Paul Downton's claims made on Test Match Special

Hitting out: Pietersen was criticised for his 'irresponsible' batting style during the Ashes series in Australia

Yet his claims that Pietersen was ‘disinterested’ and ‘distracted’ during the Sydney Test in January and that all senior players and management agreed with the sacking incurred the wrath of the player and his lawyers who have been engaged in talks with the ECB’s legal team over the last week.

Those talks ended with Downton issuing an apology for talking about the matter but not for what he said.

It is another blow to the ECB, who have been outmanoeuvred by Pietersen in the PR stakes despite having justifiable reasons for the sacking. It will also be frustrating for senior players and coaches who want the full story made public as soon as possible.

And the fact that Pietersen has regularly appeared to breach the confidentiality agreement himself through comments made via his voluble mouthpiece Piers Morgan does not seem to have been taken into account.

What is clear is that both sides should 
have been allowed to have their say at the time, rather than leaving 
frustrated supporters in the dark.

Meanwhile, after the twin 
imposters of Durham disaster and Old Trafford triumph, England will go 
in search of consistency at Lord’s on Saturday when they look to clinch a 
one-day series that would provide a significant boost for them.

Three
 one-sided matches in the Royal London series see England 2-1 up with 
two to play and determined to repeat the positive cricket which saw them
 recover from being skittled for 99 in the North East to blast Sri Lanka
 out for 67 under Manchester’s leaden skies on Wednesday. 

The sun 
may finally shine on the tourists at Lord’s today which could provide a 
more level playing field and a test of the methods which England insist 
they will employ all the way to the World Cup next February in 50-over 
cricket.

‘We’ve tried to learn from what has gone on and we want to 
produce the brand of cricket we saw at Old Trafford again and again 
now,’ said spinner James Tredwell. ‘That’s the focus. There’s not a lot 
of time left until the World Cup and, win or lose, we want to do the 
things that we think will stand us in good stead in that tournament.’

England
 have seemed a seamer short in these recent matches, although that 
problem should be addressed when Stuart Broad and Ben Stokes return to 
the one-day side.

For now, though, captain Alastair Cook must find 20
 overs from a combination of Tredwell, Ravi Bopara and Joe Root to 
supplement his three main bowlers.
