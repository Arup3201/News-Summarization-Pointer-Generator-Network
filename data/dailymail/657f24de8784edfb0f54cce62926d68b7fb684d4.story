A packet of nice honey-glazed ham here, a block of rather tasty Stilton there: everyone knows there are surprisingly good deals to be found in discount supermarkets such as Lidl and Aldi.

But sometimes these deals are less surprising, more jaw-dropping.

A whisky being sold in Lidl for under £40 a bottle has become the latest food and drink sensation, after experts claimed it is a 'superstar' spirit worth at least £100.

Lidl has sourced its own brand from an unnamed distiller and is selling it for £39.99 - it claims it is worth £100 a bottle and, according to whisky experts, they may not be exaggerating

Whisky buffs are set to clear the 33-year-old Maxwell Single Malt Scotch Whisky off
shelves of the budget chain, after reviews described it as 'nearing 
perfection' and 'a whiskey that gives us all a reason to live'.

The little-known liquor, launched in the chain's UK stores today, is set to become a collector's item, according to reports.

Lidl has sourced its own brand from an unnamed distiller and is selling it for £39.99. It claims it is worth £100 a bottle and, according to whisky experts, they may not be exaggerating.

One highly rated whisky reviewer, Jim Murray, gave the spirit 95 points out of 100 and raved: 'This has to be nosed to be believed. Here is a chance to have a sniff at something nearing perfection.

'It is a superstar whisky that gives us all a reason to live - a malt destined to be a collector's item.'

Supermarkets like Lidl are already well known for putting the noses of established brands out of joint by snaring awards for their noticeably cheaper own-brand products, from wine to Christmas pudding

Supermarkets are already well known for putting the noses of established brands out of joint by snaring awards for their noticeably cheaper own-brand products, from wine to Christmas pudding.

But it is unusual for a budget grocer to outscore the traditional distillers in the world of malt whisky.

Lidl said: 'It is the first time that we have sourced a whisky of this kind which would normally retail at over £100. We are expecting it to fly off the shelves when it arrives in time for Christmas.'
