Victoria's Secret have released images
of Candica Swanepoel, Adriana Lima and Behati Prinsloo showing off a lot of bottom in the brand's new range of lingerie.

Wearing
underwear in an array of colours and styles, the Angels are seen 
relaxing on beds, posing on chairs and lifting up their camisoles 
to show off their perfectly toned physiques.

South
African stunner Swanepoel, 24, has been a Victoria's Secret Angel for 
three years and frequently features in the brand's advertising imagery 
and catwalk shows, so it's no surprise the blonde bombshell knows how to make their product look good.

She stars in their latest campaign wearing blue boxer shorts over pink and red lingerie, playing with her hair and showing off her slim curves.

Adriana Lima, meanwhile, might be eight years older at 32 but proves she's still worth her model credentials without a dimple or wrinkle in sight as she poses in an array of small knickers - and not much else.

Girl-next-door Behati Prinsloo, fiancée to Maroon 5 crooner Adam Levine, is the same age as Swanepoel but looks the youngest of all, laughing sweetly in many of her images.

Lesser known model Cris Urena, also a Victoria's Secret Angel, stars in images showing off a monochrome range of leopard-print and lace lingerie.

Victoria's Secret creative director, Sophia Neophitou-Apostolou, recently revealed the 'terrifying' casting process all models must go through to secure a spot in the lingerie giant's annual runway show.

It might be a feat these established Angela have already conquered, but every season they must submit themselves for pre-inspection.

'They all have to do it - even the contracted girls - and it's incredibly nerve-wracking for them,' Mrs Neophitou-Apostolou told Vogue UK.

'It's quite terrifying for [the models]... They are provisionally cast by John Pfeiffer but the final decision is made by the whole team, sitting at this long table in a room with really harsh lighting and they have to walk towards us and away from us,' she added.

'It's about being show-ready,' she said.

'It's
really like being an Olympian - they have to be in peak condition. It's
not about being thin or anything like that - it's about being ready to 
perform and be the best you can be in that moment. It's not about being thin - it's about being ready to perform'

Victoria's
Secret Angel Lindsay Ellingson is certainly already in full prep mode 
for the Christmas runway show set to air December 10th - but rather than
trying to lose weight, the model says wants to 'add curves'.

During
New York Fashion Week last Tuesday, the 28-year-old told Fashionista: 
'I think it’s sexier and more feminine to be more full. So I add like 
almond butter, peanut butter, protein shakes to my diet, just to feel a 
little sexier and curvier.'

And
although the model, who has also walked for Gucci, Chanel and Oscar de 
la Renta, said she 'steps up' her workouts in preparation for the show, 
she admitted: 'I try not to stress about it because that’s never good.'

Miss
Ellingson, who was in Paris last week with fellow Angles Karlie Kloss, 
Adriana Lima and Behati Prinsloo shooting the annual Victoria's Secret 
Christmas commercial, seems to be an anomaly when it comes to her 
pre-show diet.

Last year, 
Joan Smalls, Doutzen Kroes, Adriana Lima, Candice Swanepoel and newcomer
Hilary Roda all took to social media to make note of their 
calorie-counters and workout regimes in the race to the runway.

Ms
Lima, a new mother at the time, uploaded pictures to her Twitter 
account showing herself post workout.Meanwhile Miss Smalls, 24, proudly 
posted on Twitter that she burned more than 800 calories yesterday, 
according to the picture's calorie-counting watch.

Before
the Victoria's Secret Fashion Show, models have famously worked out 
harder and watched their diets far more carefully to attain an extra 
toned and svelte look.
