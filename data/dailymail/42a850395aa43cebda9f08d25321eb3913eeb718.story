When Paul Lombard quit his job teaching English in South Korea, he could have hopped on a flight and been back home in Cheltenham the next day.

Instead the 29-year-old decided to cycle the 6,000 miles back despite never owning a bike before.

Mr Lombard set off on March 26 but only arrived home on Sunday after 265 days on the road pedalling across China, the Middle East, and Europe.

Paul Lombard, 29, has spent the last 265 days cycling 6,000 miles home from South Korea to Cheltenham

Half way round the world: Mr Lombard cycled from Seoul to Cheltenham via Asia, the Middle East, and Europe

On his trip Mr Lombard tackled temperatures of 50C (122F) in Uzbekistan, dodged bombs in Iraq, and suffered through snow in Germany.

He said: 'It was a very exhausting last leg. It was colder and darker and rainier and that pushed me on to get it finished.

'Germany was beautiful, the scenery was nice and there was some snow, but I am glad to be finished. I will probably never experience anything like that again. I've met so many interesting people.

Mr Lombard's journey took him 3,000 miles across the width of China. He is pictured here between the central city of Xi'an and the North West province ofLanzhou

For much of the route Mr Lombard followed the G30 Expressway which connects East and West China

'I wanted to find a more interesting way 
of travelling back from South Korea. I wanted a challenge. I just 
started looking at different blogs of ways people had got back and saw 
that.

'I wasn't much of a 
cyclist and didn't know much about bikes, I sort of learned along the 
way. I'm really glad I chose to go home that way, it was a great way to 
travel.'

Paul added that
 he had received an early Christmas present on his return, meeting his 
seven-month-old nephew Arthur, who was born while he was away.

After tackling the sandy deserts of Western China Mr Lombard crossed the border into Kyrgyzstan

The teacher says he often relied on the kindness of locals - including these people from Uzbekistan - who gave him a place to sleep and wash while often struggling to support themselves

Mr Lombard says he had to wait two months before being allowed into Iran and almost cancelled the trip

Once he was allowed in Mr Lombard continued his journey across the country, stopping to visit Tehran

Paul's trip saw him ride 3,000 miles 
across China, cross over into Kyrgyzstan, then travel through Tajikistan
 and Uzbekistan before heading on to Iran.

He
 said: 'It was very hot in that region. In Uzbekistan in particular, 
where it was 50 degrees, even the local people were saying it was 
unnaturally hot.

'It was too hot to cycle in the day, so I would find somewhere cool to rest and continued with my journey at night.'

The temperatures in Iran (pictured) were high, but not as high as Uzbekistan where they reached 50C

From Iran Mr Lombard made his way into Iraq where he captured this stunning sunset

While crossing Iraq Mr Lombard had to make a detour after five bombs which off in Iraqi-Kurdistan capital Irbil

Along the way punctured tyres were a constant problem for Mr Lombard, who is an amateur cyclist

Just 192 days into his cycle, in Iraq, Paul was forced to make a last-minute change to his plans when five bombs exploded in the usually safe Iraqi-Kurdistan capital of Irbil.

After that he headed on to Turkey, before crossing the border into Europe and taking on Greece, Bulgaria, Romania, Austria, Germany and France.

Paul said the lowest point of the trip
 was having to wait for two months to get a visa to enter Iran, which 
was the only time he considered giving up with his journey.

'It
 was all about achieving the mile stones, once I crossed China, which 
was by far the longest part of my journey I knew I could do the rest.

'But
 waiting for my visas was awful. I didn't know if I could move forward 
or not. The Iranian visa took so long but it came through eventually.'

From Iraq Mr Lombard travelled into Turkey where he captured this remarkable image of a tree

While on his way through Turkey Mr Lombard passed through Gaziantep in the South East, one of the oldest continuously occupied cities on the planet

He says his journey was 'one of the best experiences of my life' and says he has no regrets about choosing an unorthodox way home. Here he is pictured in Turkey

For most of the trip he camped in tents by the side of the road - such as here in Turkey

When he wasn't cycling Mr Lombard 
spent his time camping on the side of the road and in the occasional 
hotel, but also found families to take him in.

He
 said he was impressed by the small acts of kindness he experienced on 
the way, often from people who couldn't afford to help themselves.

'It was such a relief and it restores 
your faith in humanity when there's so many people prepared to help you 
along the way,' he said.

Throughout the trip border checks held him up. Here Mr Lombard crosses into Bulgaria from Greece

He could have just hopped on a 12 hour flight from Seoul to Heathrow, but instead Mr Lombard chose to spend 265 cycling across two continents. Here he is crossing Bulgaria

Mr Lombard called the scenery in Germany was stunning but said the cold weather made him want to finish

Back at last: Mr Lombard passes through London on the penultimate day of his nine-month trip

'I've met so many hospitable people and in countries you might not expect them to be hospitable. It was really good just to meet lots of really nice people who would just let you stay with them for nothing.'

Mr Lombard's return was celebrated by a party thrown by his friends and family and he said he now plans to use his break to sleep before applying for a masters degree in International development.

The trip has raised more than Â£1,400 for the Mines Advisory Group charity, which clears landmines and bombs in countries affected by conflict.
