In a brave and shocking statement about the unobtainable beauty ideals perpetuated by modern media, an artist has allowed the Photoshop transformation of herself to be made into the music video to her first single.

The haunting video sees Hungarian musician Boggie, real name Csemer Boglarka, singing her song Nouveau Parfum as she is altered through post-production in real time.

Starting out make-up free, looking tired and with her hair unstyled, the singer is digitally retouched in front of our eyes, transformed in just a few minutes into a glamorous beauty.

When they are placed next to each other, the difference between the retouched and real Boggie is startling

The digital remastering creates a woman (right) who, while she looks stunning and conforms to our beauty ideals, bears little resemblance to the real artist (left)

The start of the simple video sees Boggie, simply dressed and wearing no make-up seen through a computer screen as her image starts to be manipulated

The skin tone is lightened and any imperfections are removed by the computer programs

The right eye is widened and its shape altered before it is copied, flipped, and used to replace the left eye

The colour and shape of her eyes, colour and style of her hair, skin tone and whiteness of her teeth are all completely altered, quite literally changing her identity.

You can see skin imperfections wiped away at the click of a mouse, and artificial flattering lighting creates the kind of radiant and highlighted skin that women spend thousands trying to achieve, not realising that what they are trying to emulate does not exist in reality.

Shockingly the facial shape is also altered in the video and her right eye is artificially widened before a mirror image of it is created and pasted over her real left eye to create perfect symmetry in the face. 

The teeth are whitened and the lips made fuller and more pink using a program specifically designed to alter parts of the face

The computer program can totally change eye colour- allowing the programer to pick from a vast colour palette

Similarly, hair style, length and colour are all easily manipulable, as if creating a doll

Once flawless eye make-up has been digitally applied and the hair 'perfected', we are left with a woman who, while she looks stunning and conforms to our beauty ideals, bears little resemblance to the real artist.

Boggie chose to reveal the extent to which celebrities are altered as the video for her song which criticises modern consumerism and urges women to be themselves.

The song, which is sung in French, starts with a list of brands and designers such as Prada, Hugo Boss, Chanel, Giorgio Armani, and  Lancome, before moving onto the refrain which states, ‘I am not a product.’

The chorus declares ‘Of beauty, preciousness; they cannot change me. Peerless, unparalleled. The new fragrance is myself’ while the third verse states ‘mascara, blush, lipstick, lipsticks, lip liners, eye shadow, foundation, nail, pressed powder and I do not want it.’

Flattering lighting and perfect eye make is applied

Under the new lighting, Boogie's hair colour is once again changed, scrolling through a range of colours until the perfect shade is found

As a final touch, Boogie's hair is swept to one side and digitally made to look much thicker

The video, which has exploded across the web since its release last week, is part of a trend attempting to lift the lid on the lack of reality in celebrity culture and advertising.

In October, a 36-second clip, created by GlobalDemocracy.com, showing a relatively average-looking girl turned into a bombshell glamour model, went viral, adding fuel to the ongoing debate surrounding airbrushed models and how they can set unrealistic examples to impressionable young girls.

A result of this is an increasing backlash against altering images, with American Eagle being the latest brand to release a totally un-airbrushed campaign for its new line of lingerie.

The debate was reopened this week surrounding the digital retouching of Lena Dunham for her Vogue photoshoot (though it was, many thought, misjudged), and increasingly, brands who overuse Photoshop are being ‘shamed’ online, with the original images obtained and released as a comparison.
