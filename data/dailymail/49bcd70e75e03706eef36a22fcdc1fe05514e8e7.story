Access Hollywood: Christopher Chaney, from Florida, is facing 60 years in jail after hacking celebrities' email accounts

A computer hacker who admitted accessing Scarlett Johansson's emails and leaking nude photographs of her online has boasted about how easy it was to do.

Christopher Chaney, 35, faces up to 60 years in prison and a $2.2million fine for the stunt which also saw him hacking into the email accounts of singer Christina Aguilera and actress Mila Kunis.

He explained that to get into star's emails had been relatively easy - using Google and the 'I forgot my password' button.

After trying out combinations of A-listers' names to find working email addresses, he reset account passwords by researching pet names, where they were born and went to school. 

Chaney told GQ: 'You feel like you've seen something that the rest of the world wanted to see. But you're the only one that's seen it.'

He added: 'I don't want to compare it to throwing a touchdown pass... but it was a rush.'

Chaney, of Jacksonville, Florida, was arrested last October as part of a year-long investigation of celebrity hacking that authorities dubbed 'Operation Hackerazzi'.

He was tracked down by federal agents with a battering ram to his run-down brick home home which he had once shared with his late grandmother.

The depth of his hacking - which kept unemployed Chaney glued to his computer screen for days at a time - saw him access exchanges between celebrities and other famous people, along with their family members, partners, producers and doctors.

In all he had accessed the private information of around 50 stars including actresses Busy Phillips and Ali Larter  - which he unearthed with virtually no technical computer training.

He also hijacked a forwarding feature so a copy of every email a 
celebrity received was sent to an account he controlled, according to 
court documents.

Chaney 
claimed to have photos of Christina Aguilera wearing only her underwear 
and pictures of a well-known actress in her 'mid-to-late forties' naked.

The 35-year-old also admitted to being privy to information 
about male stars who were hiding the fact they were gay for the 
sake of their careers.

Prosecutors said Chaney illegally 
accessed the email accounts of more than 50 people in the entertainment 
industry between November 2010 and October 2011.

Nude photos Johansson had taken of 
herself were later posted on the Internet. Johansson told Vanity Fair in
its December issue that the photos were meant for Ryan Reynolds, now 
her ex-husband.

However Chaney claimed that he had 
not hacked the email accounts to make money but for 'personal' reasons 
because he was simply a movie fanatic. 

He said that female stars were 
not even his preferred targets but location scouts, producers and industry 
insiders as he became more and more obsessed with the process of making films.

Many images were forwarded to two gossip websites and another hacker, but there was not any evidence that he profited from his scheme, authorities said.

Chaney pleaded guilty to nine counts involving hacking last month. He has been jailed until sentencing on July 23 after it was discovered that he had continued to hack into celebrity email accounts even after he was interviewed by FBI agents and confessed to his scheme.
