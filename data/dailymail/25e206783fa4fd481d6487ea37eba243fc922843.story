West Ham are closing in on a move for Lazio defender Michael Ciani.

The Hammers are understood to be in advanced talks with the Frenchman over a one-year loan deal.

The 30-year-old Frenchman has been in Serie A for two seasons but is ready to seal a move to England, having been linked with fellow Londoners Crystal Palace earlier in the summer.

Sportsmail understands any loan deal would be with a view to a permanent switch in the summer.

Sam Allardyce is on the lookout for a new defender after missing out on Micah Richards, who will join the Serie A club Fiorentina.

West Ham have already made eight summer signings following the arrivals of Alex Song, Mauro Zarate, Cheikhou Kouyate, Enner Valencia, Diafra Sakho, Carl Jenkinson, Aaron Cresswell and Diego Poyet.

Out of favour: Ciani is surplus to requirements at Lazio but West Ham are looking to bolster their defence
