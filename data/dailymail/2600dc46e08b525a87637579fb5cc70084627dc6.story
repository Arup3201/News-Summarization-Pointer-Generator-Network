A violent thug who left a man confined to a wheelchair with a section of his skull missing after knocking him to the ground with a single punch has been handed a prison sentence of just 20 months.

Thomas Field, 27, attacked Reece Roberts, who has a genetic growth disorder and learning difficulties, on a night out in Blackpool, Lancashire.

A court heard how he approached Mr Roberts, 25, while he was smoking outside a bar, knocked him to the ground with a vicious blow and then said: 'he shouldn't have been so mouthy'.

Life-changing injuries: After the attack Mr 
Roberts, left, needed to have parts of his skull removed, and must now 
be fed through a tube. He is pictured right before his injuries

Mr Roberts, 25, is now unable to walk or talk and must be fed through a tube. Surgeons had to remove part of his skull to relieve pressure on his brain.

Field pleaded guilty to a charge of grievous bodily harm. The court heard how he lashed out at Mr Roberts 'for no apparent reason' as he stood outside Bar 19 in Blackpool smoking a cigarette.

Unprovoked: Thomas Field, 27, attacked Reece Roberts, 25, for 'no apparent reason', leaving him severely disabled

The maximum sentence for his crime is five years, but Field was jailed for 20 months after the judge reduced his sentence for pleading guilty and being 'remorseful'. It means he could be released from prison after ten months.

Mr Roberts, a student at Blackpool and The Fylde College, has a genetic disorder called cerebral gigantism, which means he is taller and thinner than most people, and also has learning difficulties.

Millissa Roberts, 42, Mr Roberts's mother, has said she believes that he was targeted because of the condition, which is also known as Sotos syndrome.

The hearing, at Preston Crown Court, heard how Mr Roberts was attacked at 1.50am on September 27 while he was 'minding his own business'.

Prosecutor Miss Raquel Simpson told the court: 'The defendant was stood close by, then for no apparent reason 
walked up to Reece and punched him once to the face. It caused him to 
fall to the floor.'

'The defendant appeared to brag about what he had done - he said: "He shouldn't have been so mouthy".'

Reece
 was helped to his feet but then collapsed and was taken to Blackpool 
Victoria Hospital, and was later transferred to Preston Royal Hospital due to his head injuries.

Miss Simpson 
said: 'He remains severely disabled and needs assistance to eat, walk 
and other daily activities. It clearly has had a dramatic and 
life-changing impact on the complainant. His recovery cannot be 
predicted. It is likely he will be left with life a significant physical
 disability.'

'Well-liked': Mr Roberts, pictured left holding his younger brother and right more recently, was popular at the college he attended, and was described by his mother as 'a joker'

Police tracked down Field, a father of five, three days after the attack. When confronted with his crime he replied 'Yeah, I know'. A newspaper cutting about the attack was found at 
the property.

Field had 
previous convictions for assault and battery including a suspended 
sentence for causing actual body harm. In 2011 when he and two 
accomplices attacked a man for no reason, kicking him in the head and causing
 injuries to his eye.

Defence lawyer Bob Sastry told the court: 'He is devastated by what he
 has done and the injuries so severe as they are, through the delivery 
of one punch.

'He is fortunate that he doesn't face the charge of manslaughter. He 
extends a sincere apology to the family. He fully accepts that he has 
issues with anger management.'

Passing
 sentence, Recorder Michael Blakey told Field: 'Because of 
your actions you have effectively destroyed a family and caused a great 
deal of significant upset because of the catastrophic nature of the 
injuries sustained.

'You 
are extremely lucky you didn't cause the death of this young man. The 
fact that you take drink and drink was taken is no excuse, what you did 
on that particular night will never be an excuse.

'I accept that you are remorseful for what you did and pleaded guilty at the first opportunity.'

Speaking after the verdict, Millissa Roberts said: 'I dream of him being on the street and I'm running towards him and then somebody comes and hits him and I'm still running and running. All I want to do is grab him and protect him.

'Reece was just minding his own business when he was attacked. He is so placid and well liked by everybody, he is funny and a joker. I think he was picked on because of the way he looks.

'My son has done nothing wrong in his life and has been through hell and back and still is going through it. Now doctors need to put metal plates in his head because his head is caving in and his brain is shrinking.

'It's heartbreaking to see the change in him going from a young lad who used to like going out with his mates and watching the football to being in hospital relying on other people to help him. He cannot speak, he needs to be fed directly into his stomach.

'The prognosis is unclear but it is clear his life has changed forever. I don't dare tell Reece what punishment Field got as he would be frightened to death of him coming after him again. He will be out in a few months yet we are serving a life sentence. To walk up to someone and punch them shows he is evil.

'What he got was simply not enough.'
