The Amazons - an ancient coalition of all-female warriors - smoked cannabis, bore tattoos and fought in fierce battles like men, according to a new historical investigation. 

'Archaeology has now proven without a doubt that there really were women fitting the description that the Greeks gave us of Amazons and warrior women,' historian Adrienne Mayor tells National Geographic. 'They fought, hunted, rode horses, [and] used bows and arrows, just like the men.'

Keen to dispel long-standing beliefs that these women were mere fiction, Ms Mayor, based in Palo Alto, California, studied a wealth of textual, artistic and archaeological evidence about them before penning her book,The Amazons.

No myth: 'Archaeology has now proven without a doubt that Amazons fought, hunted, rode horses, and used bows and arrows, just like the men,' historian Adrienne Mayor finds

The Amazons belonged to a nomadic people the ancient Greeks called Scythians, who roamed areas north and west of the Mediterranean.

The excavations of thousands of burial sites from these regions have turned up skeletons - originally presumed to have been male - which were buried with weapons and battle horses.

Modern DNA testing has proved that many of these skeletons are in fact female, and bear the same sorts of war injuries found on male remains.

Every one of these Scythian skeletons, both male and female, were also found to be buried with their own 'hemp-smoking kits' and, sometimes, their own 'tattoo kits.'

Ms Mayor points to the ancient historian Herodotus, who described gatherings in which Scythians would burn a plant he specifically referred to as 'cannabis' and become 'intoxicated' around the fire.

Modern discoveries: Amazons were known to 'intoxicate' themselves with cannabis and were buried with their own 'hemp-smoking kits' and, sometimes, their own 'tattoo kits'

Evidence also exists that Scythian women often bore 'beautifully, lovingly detailed tattoos.'

For a long time, Amazons - among those who believed they actually existed - were painted as ruthless lesbian war-wagers who hated men so much that they maimed and murdered their own sons.

No archaeological evidence supports the notion that they did this to their children, says Ms Mayor.

Their name was also believed to imply in Greek that these women would cut off one of their own breasts in order to better wield a bow and arrow.

'Anyone who's watched The Hunger Games, or female archers, knows that that is an absolutely physiologically ridiculous idea,' points out Ms Mayor.

'Indeed, no ancient Greek artworks - and there are thousands - show a woman with one breast.'

Ancient slander: Theories that Amazons were ruthless lesbian war-wagers who hated men so much that they maimed and murdered their own sons have been proven highly unlikely

The widespread allusion that Amazons were all lesbians is a myth too, one that didn't develop until the 20th Century.

While their 'strong bond of sisterhood' was depicted in classical art and literature, ancient Greeks did not, Ms Mayor insists, refer to them as lesbians.

She argues that the ancient Greeks and Romans were 'not shy' about discussing or engaging in homosexuality, male or female, and if the Amazons had been lesbians, this would have been mentioned.

What was mentioned, was that Amazons may indeed have been 'man-killers' but they were also 'man lovers.'

According to popular folklore, they refrained from having sex with men except for once a year, when they would visit neighboring tribes and copulate with male members so that their race wouldn't die out.

As the legend goes, girls were kept but baby boys were either mutilated, killed, or sent back to their fathers. 

Sending sons to be raised by other tribes was indeed customary, Ms Mayor says, but more as a common way of 'sealing treaties' and 'preventing incest.' 

At the time of their existence, Amazons seem generally to have been admired.

'The Greeks were both fascinated and appalled by such independent women. They were so different from their wives and daughters,' explains Ms Mayor.

'Yet they were captivated by them. Pictures of Amazons on vase paintings always show them as beautiful, active, spirited, courageous, and brave.'

Here and now: As Ms Mayors mentions, female warriors still exist today; most notably of late,  a young Kurdish woman called Rehana who was reported to have killed 'more than a hundred ISIL fighters'

As Ms Mayors mentions, female warriors still exist today; most notably of late, the Kurdish Peshmerga women currently fighting ISIS.

Last week, for example, a young Kurdish woman called Rehana was reported by Al Jazeera to have killed 'more than a hundred ISIL fighters'

And for the purpose of entertainment, female fighters have arisen in shows from Xena: Warrior Princess in the 90s, to The Hunger Games and Game of Thrones.

'It's sort of fair to say that Amazons, both as reality and as a dream of equality, have always been with us,' concludes Ms Mayors.

'It's just that sometimes that fiery Amazon spirit is hidden from view or even suppressed. Right now they're blazing back into popular culture.'
