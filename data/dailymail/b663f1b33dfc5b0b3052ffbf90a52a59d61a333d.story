A five-year-old girl has been pulled from the rubble of a house flattened by a massive avalanche that killed both her parents and at least seven of her relatives in a remote mountain village in Kosovo.

Rescuers managed to free Asmira Reka in the early hours of yesterday morning after hearing her voice and mobile phone more than ten hours after the avalanche buried her home in Restelica  under 33ft of snow on Saturday.

Security forces covered the child with blankets before she was rushed to hospital.

Saved: Asmira Reka, five, is pulled from the wreckage of her home in Restelica, Kosovo, after an avalanche struck on Saturday. Her parents and at least seven other relatives were killed in the tragedy

Rescue operation: The avalanche struck in the region near Kosovo's border with Macedonia and Albania. In Restelica it destroyed seven houses, of which only two were inhabited

Osman Qerreti, an emergency official 
at the site, said that at least nine members of her family died when the
avalanche in the village near Kosovo's border with Macedonia and 
Albania destroyed seven houses, of which only two were inhabited.

Amid
sub-freezing temperatures yesterday, local villagers braving fierce 
snowstorms used shovels to dig deep into the snow-covered rubble - all 
that remained of the brick houses.

One more person is believed missing.

Local district official Behar Ramadani said: 'No bigger tragedy has ever struck this region. Two brothers with their wives and children have been killed.'

Asmira
is recovering in hospital in the nearby town of Prizren. Doctors 
said her life was not in danger, but her parents had perished in the 
avalanche.

Nato 
peacekeepers, deployed in Kosovo to end the armed conflict between Serbs
and Kosovo Albanians in 1999, had been called in to help local 
authorities in the rescue, but they were unable to land their helicopter
due to a fierce blizzard.

Rescuers
initially dug out the bodies of a married couple and their 17-year-old 
son. Six more bodies were discovered during the excavation.

On guard: Members of the Kosovo Security Force monitor the area around the avalanche-hit houses

Ongoing search: Security forces carry away a victim's body as their colleagues continued to look for survivors

Appalling conditions: Amid sub-freezing temperatures yesterday, emergency workers and the army braved fierce snowstorms using shovels to dig deep into the snow-covered rubble

The
cold snap in Europe, which began in late January, has killed hundreds 
of people - most of them homeless. Heavy snow has been blanketing the 
Balkans for more than two weeks, with Restelica and roads in the region 
blocked for several days.

In
neighbouring Montenegro, where the government introduced a state of 
emergency because of the deep freeze, special police forces yesterday 
managed to reach about 50 train passengers stranded for two days after 
tracks were blocked by avalanches.

Police
said a 55-year-old passenger had died from a heart attack on Saturday 
night, while the others were sheltering in a nearby tunnel.

The
airport in Podgorica remained closed on Sunday and the streets were 
blocked by snow up to 22-inches high - the highest since measurements 
started in the capital in 1949.

Authorities have banned driving in the capital, while many parked cars were damaged after snow-covered trees fell on them.

Dug out: Security forces identify two victims pulled from the rubble. One person is still believed missing

Police
in Bosnia said the roof of a sports centre in Sarajevo used for 
ice-skating events in the 1984 Winter Olympics collapsed yesterday under
the weight of snow. No injuries or fatalities have been reported.

In
Serbia, the snow continued to fall on Sunday as some 50,000 people 
remained stranded in snowbound remote areas, some without electricity.

In Albania, the government is expected
to declare a state of emergency in the north and south of the country, 
said Prime Minister Sali Berisha.

Much of Italy's north-central east was
digging out after heavy snowfall collapsed roofs onto barnyard animals,
closed roads and wreaked havoc with air transport.

Twenty
horses were killed when a roof collapsed in Badia Tedalda, one of the 
central Tuscan towns hardest hit by the snow. In Le Marche, regional 
civil protection crews reported thousands of cows, pigs and other farm 
animals killed.

In Rome, the
sun shone and whatever snow remained from Saturday's blizzard - the 
second in as many weeks - melted away. But Mayor Gianni Alemanno kept a 
ban in place on motorcycles in the city centre, where some streets 
remained icy.

In Russia, 
20,000 amateur and professional cross-country skiers in Yakhroma, some 
30miles from Moscow, were undeterred by temperatures of -23C. They raced
for three miles as part of a mass skiing competition held every year.
