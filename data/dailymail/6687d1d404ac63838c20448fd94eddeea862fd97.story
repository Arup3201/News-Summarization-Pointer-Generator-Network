In a meeting room in London, a group of women are shrieking and hollering at each other while wielding cricket bats. It all looks slightly deranged - and dangerous - but they've signed up for a session with the Tantrum Club.

It's a new support group (call it legitimised ranting) in which stressed-out executives and harassed housewives come together to let off steam - without getting either fired or divorced.Â 

The idea was the brainchild of Adele Theron, 35, who founded the Naked Divorce, a 21-day programme to help separating couples.

The first day of the programme was dedicated to releasing anger and, as word spread, Adele found herself inundated with inquiries from people who weren't getting divorced, but who still wanted a slice of the shout-it-out action.

Realising she was on to something, the Tantrum Club was born.

The first few groups proved so successful that Adele - who runs the service for no charge - is in negotiations to set up Tantrum Clubs in gyms nationwide.

There is even a phoneline, available through phone-and-rant.com, where you can scream down your handset.

It's all contrary to the Keep Calm and Carry On spirit, but that's the point.

'For a long time women have been told they need to keep a lid on things, to soldier on, but suppressing anger is bad for you and your health,' says Adele, who has teenagers and octogenarians participating in mass shouting, beating beanbags with a cricket bat, wailing and drumming.
