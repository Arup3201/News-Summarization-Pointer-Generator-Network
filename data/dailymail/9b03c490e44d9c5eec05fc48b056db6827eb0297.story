A talented horsewoman killed herself hours after her beloved mare was put to sleep, an inquest heard.

Stephanie Lees, 42, from Barnsley, South Yorkshire, was found clutching a lock of her horse's mane after taking her own life when the animal had to be put down.

The equestrian had devoted ten years to caring for her horse Jake, who she rode in the fields and lanes around her rural village, and had become even more attached to him when her other horse, Elliot, died three years ago.

Stephanie Lees, 42, from Barnsley, South Yorkshire, was found clutching a lock of her horse's mane after taking her own life when the animal had to be put down following illness in November last year, inquest told

The equestrian had devoted ten years to caring for her horse Jake (pictured together in 2008), who she rode in the fields and lanes around her rural village, and had became 'very distressed' when he became unwell

The animal, which had been lame for a few months, had to be put to sleep in November last year, due to an illness called colic, which manifested following an operation on its leg.

However, Ms Lees – a chartered surveyor for Barnsley Council - was unable to cope with the animal's death and took her own life just hours after the horse was put down.

Ms Lees, who was single and had no children, had been unable to ride Jake for more than a year due to his ill health and had struggled to cope as she watched the animal deteriorate.

At an inquest into her death in Sheffield today, her friend Jane Taylor told of her utter shock at finding her on Remembrance Day last November.

She said: 'That day I went up to the stables to go for a ride with my friend Helen.

'We passed a gateway that gives access to a parking area. I heard Helen say 'Oh my God', then I heard the words 'Steph'.

The inquest heard how Ms Taylor 'knew Steph was dead' after touching her shoulders and the pair called the emergency services.

She added: 'She had a lock of her horse's hair in her hands'.

Another close friend of Ms Lees, Joanne Weatherall, said: 'Stephanie remained with Jake right up until the point the vet administered the injection. She was very upset.'

Police officer Stephen Taylor, from South Yorkshire Police, told the hearing that following the equestrian's body being found, a search of her house uncovered a note.

He said: 'It was basically saying that she lived for her horses and because the horse had been put to sleep she couldn't cope anymore.

'There was also a list of a dozen friends giving an amount of money to each person on the list.'

Recording a verdict of suicide, assistant coroner Julian Fox said: 'She had been a great lover of horses in particular her horse Jake, who had been ill with a bad leg. She hadn't been able to ride him for 18 months or so.

'It was concluded that sadly Jake needed to be put down. Steph was not able to watch Jake die and was clearly very, very distressed when that took place.

'Despite having a good circle of friends it seems clear to me that she felt she could live no longer.

'Having heard the circumstances relating to Jake and in relation to the way her body was found and a note saying goodbye I have no doubt at all that Steph did intend to take her own life.'

Mr Fox expressed his sympathy to Miss Lees' parents John and Josephine, saying: 'Perhaps in her mind at last she is now with the horse she loved.

'It is an extremely unexpected event, this lady was very talented and capable and barely in the prime of her life.'

Following her death last year, Ms Lees' mother Josephine said she and her husband John were 'devastated and heartbroken'.

Ms Lees, 42, (pictured riding her horse Jake in 2008) took her own life just hours after the mare had to be put down in November last year. She was found dead by friends near her home in Barnsley, South Yorkshire

Ms Lees cared for Jake for ten years and would visit him morning and night at these stables near her home in Barnsley, South Yorkshire. Her parents said they were 'heartbroken and devastated' over her death

Floral tributes were placed near the stables where Ms Lees kept her horses following her death last year

The 74-year-old said: 'Steph couldn't bear to be parted from Jake and made a decision to join him.

'It was really the loss of Jake which broke her heart. He had gone lame about 18 months ago and had to be put down the day before.

'She hadn't been able to ride him and devoted most of her spare time to looking after him. She absolutely adored him.'

'She just wanted to join him, which is in some ways a happy thing, but also very sad.

'She was very much loved. We've had about 200 cards from people.'

At her funeral, friends followed her coffin on horseback and recalled a 'wonderful, caring and patient' woman.

One friend paid tribute online, writing: 'Steph was a sunbeam. The prettiest smile in the village and a fine horsewoman. Unbearably sad to think she's gone from us.'
