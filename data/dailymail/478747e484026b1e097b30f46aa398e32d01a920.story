Iran paraded its military might today in a show of force which came as Isis continued making gains in neighbouring Iraq and Syria which have taken it to within 15 miles of the border with Turkey.

The Islamic Republic marked the 34th anniversary of Iraq's invasion of the country on September 22, 1980 and led to an eight-year war.

Thousands of soldiers and members of the guard marched in front of the country's president, Hassan Rouhani, who gave a speech at the ceremony in Tehran.

Army Commander Ataollah Salehi, Revolutionary Guard Commander Mohammad Ali Jafari  and Chief of the General Staff of Iran's Armed Forces, Hasan Firouzabadi were other notable commanders in attendance.

Every unit of the Iranian Army, as well as the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps joined in the parade, remembering the war in which around half a million soldiers died.

The war is known as the 'Sacred Defence', and the parade was the opening ceremony of 'Sacred Defence Week',  starting at the mausoleum of Imam Khomeini, the founder of the Islamic Republic.

Groups from the Iranian Kurds and the Iranian Arabs walked side-by-side during the ceremony - a display of the country's unity.

President Rouhani jetted off to New York and the United Nations General Assembly immediately afterwards, and was seen off by a group of top Iranian officials.

The Iranian army is made up of around 815,000 people - it has two parallel land forces - the regular army and the Army of the Guardians of the Islamic Revolution.

Iran dramatically reduced its reliance on training and equipment from abroad after the war with Iraq in 1988, and the army underwent a huge restructure.

Before the war it had been armed with the latest equipment from the West, including the USA, Britain and France, but during the war, as supplies ran out, they were also forced to Russia, China and North Korea. 

It now boasts more than 2,400 tanks, including the likes of T-72s, more than 1,500 armoured fighting vehicles, almost 900 multiple-launch rocket systems, nearly 500 aircraft and around 400 ships.

The Iran-Iraq was lasted from September 22, 1980 to August 20, 1988 and came after years of disputes over borders and fears that the 1979 Iranian revolution would inspire a similar rebellion among Iraq's Shi'ites and that Iran may replace Iraq as the dominant country in the region.

It was known as the Gulf War up until the Persian Gulf War in 1990, and is now sometimes still referred to as the First Persian Gulf War. 

It started with the Iraqi air force, under the orders of President Saddam Hussein, launching surprise attacks on the Iranians with formal warning, and also attacked on the ground, but they did not make much progress before being repelled by the Iranians until they had been basically banished from the country by the summer of 1982.

Iran was the aggressor for the remaining six years, until the war finally ended thanks to UN-brokered ceasefire Resolution 598, which saw borders restored to exactly how they had been before the war.

The final prisoners of war were exchanged in 2003. 

There were Iranians who fought for Iraq, and vice versa - including Iraqi Kurdish Democratic Party fighters siding with Iran. 

Around half a million soldiers died in total, and the war has been compared to World War I because of the brutal nature of the trench warfare, machine gun posts and forays into no-man's land. Chemical weapon use was prevalent from the Iraqi side - most famously mustard gas, which causes blisters on the skin and lungs.

The war caused huge financial losses for both the Iranian and Iraqi governments - believed to be more than $500billion each, while it also significantly set back Iraq's scientific advancements.
