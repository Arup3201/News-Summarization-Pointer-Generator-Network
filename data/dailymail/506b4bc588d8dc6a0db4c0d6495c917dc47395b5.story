Fabio Borini believes a number of his team-mates proved a point to manager Brendan Rodgers during the Reds' 2-1 Capital One Cup win against Swansea on Tuesday evening.

Rodgers made several changes to his starting XI at Anfield, giving chances to Borini, Rickie Lambert, Kolo Toure and Lucas Leiva from the first whistle.

And although the Merseyside outfit had to rely on two late goals to reach the quarter-finals of the competition, the Italian striker is confident the club's fringe players made a positive impression.

Borini told liverpoolfc.com: 'I think we played really well from the kick-off until the last seconds of the game and we scored at the last possible attempt.

'It was the players who were not playing so much or so often, like myself, and we knew that when we got the chance to play, we needed to make sure that we took the chance and we showed that.'

Borini, who opted against a permanent move to Sunderland last summer, was delighted with his own display after struggling for playing time this season.

'I'm very pleased with my performance - not just for the assist, but for my performance after a long time not playing,' he added.

'Apart from me, all the other players played magnificent and we showed that we can play as a team.'
