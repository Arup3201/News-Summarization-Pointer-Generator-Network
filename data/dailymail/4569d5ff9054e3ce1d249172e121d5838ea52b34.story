They are beautiful images that reveal just how much we have come to rely on sea transport.

The amazing images show the huge expansion of cargo routes around the world.

As routes like the Suez Canal opened in 1869, they reveal just how much of the globe is now used to transport goods, with some estimates claiming 90% of the goods we use have been transported by sea at some point.

Shipping routes from 1980 to 1997, based on data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, showing the vast number of routes now being used.

The data was obtained from decades of data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's International Comprehensive Ocean-Atmosphere Data Set.

Once plotted on a map, they create a series of maps that show shipping lanes in black.

The first map, showing 1784-1863 is known as the MAURY map.

Many of the trips shown are believed to be whaling expiditions.

An assistant professor of history at Northeastern University, Ben Schmidt, created a series of maps that display the worldâ€™s modern shipping routes.

When viewed together, the routes create an inverted map of the world.

The data was obtained from decades of data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's International Comprehensive Ocean-Atmosphere Data Set.

Mr Schmidt also says they reveal that governments have long collected data on people's movements.

'These data snapshots are fascinating and revealing snapshots of how the state used to and continues to pull in information from the world,' he said.

He admits that the data used to create them is incomplete - but says they still show government surveillance has always existed.

This map is based on shipping routes from the 19th century. It shows routes principally around North and South America, Europe, and Africa. Just a few routes, depicted by faint lines, run to Asia.

The data was obtained from decades of data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's International Comprehensive Ocean-Atmosphere Data Set. Many of the earlier trips were whaling expeditions.

'Of course, on the surface, it seems to show 19th century shipping routes: that's the primary reason it's interesting.

'But it's an obviously incomplete, obviously biased, and obviously fragmentary view of those routes.

'It's a relatively complete view, on the other hand, of something more restricted but nearly as interesting: the way that the 19th century American state was able to see and take measure of the world.

'No one, today, needs to be told that patterns of state surveillance, data collection, and storage are immensely important.

'Charts like these provide an interesting and important locus for seeing how states 'saw,' to commandeer a phrase from James Scott.'

The changes over time can clearly be seen is this collection of images from the collection
