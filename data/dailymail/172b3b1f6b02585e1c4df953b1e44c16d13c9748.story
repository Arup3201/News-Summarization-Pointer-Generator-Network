A police box identical to the Doctor Who Tardis has been unveiled by officers as their latest weapon to fight crime.

The 5ft by 5ft navy blue phone boxes were a common sight across Britain in the 1920s when they were used by the public to contact the police.

But they were scrapped in the 1960s due to the widespread availability of the telephone and they are now more well known for being the disguise for Dr Who's famous time machine.

Now Dorset Police have erected a newly-built 10ft-tall police phone box - complete with a blue flashing light on top - in a shopping precinct in Boscombe, Bournemouth.

Step back in time: Dorset Police have unveiled a new police phone box which will be manned by officers. Pictured are Assistant Chief Constable David Lewis, Inspector Chris Weeks, Police and Crime Commissioner Martyn Underhill and Sergeant Chris Amey

Super fans: Doctor Who fans dressed up as characters from the TV series for the launch of a new Doctor Who-style Tardis police box in Boscombe

Talking point: Police claim the new phone box will act as an 'engagement point' between police officers and members of the public

Standing guard: Police officers won't actually sit in the phone box but will instead be found standing nearby

The steel-framed construction will be manned by a police officer between 10am and 6pn Monday to Saturday.  There is a telephone located on the outside of the box for people to use to contact the police out of hours.

As well as being a point of contact for the public, police hope their 'Tardis' will also act as a deterrent to criminals and attract tourists, especially Dr Who fans.

The construction has 'Police Box' painted on the top and an A4 sized notice attached to the front, just like the one in the BBC sci-fi drama.

The sign reads: 'Police telephone free for use of public. Advice and assistance obtainable immediately. Officers and cars respond to all calls. Pull to open.'

Fighting crime: The police phone box has been opened in Boscombe, Bournemouth, so members of the public can use it to speak to officers or report crimes. Pictured are MP Tobias Ellwood with Insp Chris Weeks and Sgt Chris Amey

Port of call: The 5ft by 5ft police phone box is 10ft tall and will be manned by officers between the hours of 10am and 6pm Monday to Saturday

Community spirit: Dorset Police hope the phone box will help deter crime and encourage tourism. Children are pictured surrounding a dalek at the official opening of the new 'Tardis' style box

Inside the box there is a first aid kit, a shelf, two plug sockets and an electric heater.

A separate external compartment reveals a bright yellow telephone for people to use in an emergency.

The project has been funded by donations from several local businesses.

Inspector Chris Weeks, from Dorset Police, said: 'Boscombe precinct is an area that has suffered with anti-social behaviour and criminality.

'We had to do something and we thought why not come up with s police box idea with a 1920s design that we thought would fit the precinct well.

Back to basics: Inside the phone box there is only a first aid kit, a shelf, two plug sockets and an electric heater

First visitors: Excited children inspect the inside of the new police phone box which has been opened in the middle of a busy high street

'We are looking forward to the positive impact this is going to have in relation to public engagement and reducing crime.

'We will endeavour to have a member of staff with the police box as much as is operationally possible during the trading hours in the precinct.'

Nick Joy, a Doctor Who fan from Bournemouth, came to watch the Police Box being launched.

He said: 'I grew up in a time when people only saw the police box on Doctor Who, we never actually knew it had a practical application.

'So the fact it has gone full circle and is to be used as a police box is brilliant.'

Finding fame: The police telephone box has become better known as the exterior disguise for Dr Who's Tardis - pictured left in the 1970s show starring Jon Pertwee and pictured right in the 2005 series starring Christopher Eccleston

Deterrent: The phone box will serve as a new police office to help the town confront anti-social behaviour

Retro: Police phone boxes were a common sight in Britain in the 1920s but most were closed in the 1960s when telephones became more readily available

Replica: The navy blue phone box also has an a4-sized notice on the outside - just like the Tardis in Dr Who

Piece of history: An original police phone box in Scarborough, North Yorkshire

The first ever public police telephone boxes in Britain were introduced in Glasgow in 1891.

They were then brought in across the rest of the UK in the 1920s so members of the public could report an emergency.

They were designed differently to ordinary telephone boxes, as the phone was located behind a hinged door, and could be used from outside the box.

The inside of the box was effectively a miniature police station which officers could use to collect first aid kits, pick up supplies or take down reports.

As telephones were not readily available in the 1920s, the police phone box was a vital link between communities and their nearest police station.

The typical police box contained a telephone linked directly to the local police station, allowing patrolling officers to keep in contact with the station, reporting anything unusual or requesting help if necessary.

They also normally contained a stool, a table, brushes and dusters, a fire extinguisher, and a small electric heater.

A light on top of the box would flash to alert nearby officers that they had to contact the station.

By 1953 there were 685 police boxes on the streets of London.

Police boxes were usually blue, except in Glasgow, where they were red until the late 1960s.

Police phone boxes started to be taken out of service from the late 1960s onwards as telephones became more widely accessible and officers began carrying two-way radios rather than relying on fixed kiosks.

Today the image of the blue police box is more widely associated with Doctor Who's time machine, the Tardis, which takes the shape of a 1960s British police box.
