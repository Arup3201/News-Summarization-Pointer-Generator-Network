Two giant pandas on loan from China for the next 15 years received a red carpet welcome in Belgium where they were greeted by Prime Minister Elio Di Rupo.

Hao Hao, a four-year-old female whose name means 'Friendly', and Xing Hui ('Shining Star'), a male of the same age, landed around midday yesterday at Brussels airport after their journey in a pagoda-style cage onboard a cargo plane.

Their plane, arriving after a 15-hour flight from Sichuan in southwest China, taxied into place through an arc of water from the hoses of Belgian firefighters.

The pandas, each weighing over 110 kilos (242lbs), emerged to find around 100 journalists and dozens of children from a nearby school waiting to welcome them.

'We are very honoured and proud that China agreed to lend Belgium two of its national treasures,' said Di Rupo.

The new arrivals were then whisked under police escort to the Pairi Daiza zoo in the town of Brugellette, 60 kilometres (37 miles) outside Brussels.

Entry tickets to the zoo were entirely
 sold out on Sunday, even though zookeepers had warned that Hao Hao and 
Xing Hui will not be making any public appearances until they have 
acclimatised and finished a period in quarantine, due to end on April 5.

The zoo has spent some 10 
million euros (£8million) to prepare a vast enclosure for its new stars 
in its 'China Garden', comprising a pool, cave and bamboo plantation.

'They
 have flown over a thousand mountains and a thousand rivers to arrive in
 Belgium,' said China's ambassador to Belgium, Liao Liqiang.

The Belgian press has also reported 
that one million euros per year is being paid as 'rent' for the pandas, 
which have been a valuable tool for soft diplomacy and revenue 
collection for China over the years.

The
 bears have their own Twitter feed and Hao Hao was named China's 
favourite panda at the international Giant Panda Zoo Awards last year.

But their arrival has inflamed old tensions between Belgium's Walloon (French-speaking) and Flemish populations.

French-speaking Mr Di Rupo has been accused by Flemish politicians of snubbing the country's oldest and most famous zoo, in Antwerp, when he helped to secure the pandas' visit to Belgium. 

Instead the pandas are to stay in the Pairi Daiza animal park near the city of Mons, where the mayor is none other than Mr Di Rupo. 

The 170-year-old Antwerp zoo insists its pedigree and prestige should have made it the first choice.

Giant pandas are an endangered species, with only 1,600 left in the wild in China and 300 in captivity around the world.
