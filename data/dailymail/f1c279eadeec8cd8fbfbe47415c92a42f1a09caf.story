He’s used to being the center of attention, but on Wednesday night Boris Johnson was left playing second fiddle to Hollywood starlet Jennifer Lawrence when the pair appeared as guests on the David Letterman Show on U.S. television.

The last time the Mayor of London appeared with Letterman he was the star attraction and enjoyed a healthy rapport with his host, but things were much more brisk and business-like this time around.

When Lawrence overran her slot while promoting the latest Hunger Games movie, Boris' interview got squeezed to under five minutes - less than half of what he had when he appeared in 2012.

Oops! Boris Johnson almost bumps into the set as he enters the David Letterman show

He may be the center of attention in London, but on the Wednesday night Boris Johnson was left playing second fiddle to Hollywood starlet Jennifer Lawrence when the pair appeared on the David Letterman Show

Looking as crumpled as ever in a black suit and blue tie, bumbling Boris got off to a bad start when he almost walked into the set when it finally became his turn to take center stage.

Things didn't improve when the interview finally started and Letterman congratulated him on his re-election - something which had actually happened before Johnson’s previous appearance almost two and a half years ago.

As well as promoting his new book, American-born Boris used his shortened slot to boast about how well London is doing under his leadership.

‘Things are going gangbusters,’ said Johnson – no doubt perplexing the audience at home – as he claimed responsibly for reductions in the crime and murder rates and even people living longer.

Exiting together: Jennifer Lawrence urged Letterman not to retire and said he should work until he dies

Lawrence appeared confused when discussing the latest Hunger Games movie and she admitted that having completed two films at the same she really doesn't know which one she's talking about at any given time

Quoting Balzac left many in the audience perplexed, but Boris at least managed to win a round of applause when he said that the recent success of the NFL games in London was testimony to Brits love for all things American.

But even then Johnson admitted he found American Football to be ‘too theoretical’ and instead professed his love for rugby.

‘Some of my happiest hours were spent being ground into the mud,’ he recalled.

Letterman then brought the conversation round to ISIS and the search for Jihadi John, the British-accented executioner.

'If the chap wants to see 72 virgins, I think he should be able to meet them as soon as possible,' said Johnson with his best quip of the night.

With his time quickly running out, Johnson finally got to talk about his book, The Churchill Factor: How One Man Made History, which he had flown over from the UK especially to promote.

However Johnson's reasons no doubt left many viewers perplexed as he said he wanted to teach children in the UK that Churchill was more than just a toy dog in an insurance commercial.

Earlier Jennifer Lawrence had laughed and joked with Letterman about her health issues and she urged him not to retire and carry on working until he dies.

She also appeared confused when discussing the latest Hunger Games movie, Mockingjay Part 1, and admitted that having completed both it and Part 2 at the same time she gets the two movies confused.
