A woman whose sister was killed by a drunk driver, ran over a cyclist while chasing her boyfriend at nearly 70mph after a drunken row.

Emma Egan leapt behind the wheel when Liam Dent drove off after dumping her.

But the 26-year-old lost control as she tailgated him at 69mph in a 40mph limit.

Emma Egan has been jailed for for four years after admitting causing death by dangerous driving

She smashed into father-of-two Eric Codling, 55, catapulting him from his bicycle and killing him instantly.

Egan, whose sister had been killed by a drink-driver eight years previously, wept as she was jailed for four years at Sheffield Crown Court.

The beauty therapist, who admitted causing death by dangerous driving, is likely to serve two years in prison before being released.

Mr Codling’s widow, Karen, said of the sentence: ‘It is disgusting. This is not justice. Is Eric’s life only worth four years?

‘I know nothing will bring Eric back, but... to only serve two years for killing somebody just doesn’t make sense.

‘Why is what she did any different to murder? We don’t feel there has been any justice.’

The court heard that Egan, from Dewsbury, West Yorkshire, was over the drink-drive limit when she chased Mr Dent through Sheffield after he ended their relationship in November last year.

After crashing into Mr Codling, she stopped briefly before driving off in her Vauxhall Astra. When police found her at Mr Dent’s home in the city, Egan was wailing incoherently, rocking in her seat and shaking. She then fell to the floor and vomited.

Egan told the officers: ‘Oh God, what have I done? I’m so sorry.’

Alan Taylor, for Egan, said she was ‘profoundly sorry for her actions leading to the tragedy’.

She had been in a state of emotional turmoil over the ending of her relationship with Mr Dent.

‘She must bear the heavy burden of guilt for the rest of her life,’ Mr Taylor said.

‘Not a day will go by when she will not remember the pain and anguish she has caused.’

Mrs Codling, 50, from Sheffield, said the fact Egan’s sister was knocked down and killed by a drink-driver ‘added insult to injury’.

That driver was also jailed for four years and Mrs Codling said: ‘Egan’s own mum at the time said a four-year sentence for the driver who killed her daughter was an outrage, and she is right – it is.’

In a victim impact statement read out in court before Egan was sentenced, Mr Codling’s 13-year-old daughter Grace described how the death of her father had affected her and her nine-year-old sister Eve.

‘I miss him being here, I miss everything about him,’ Grace said.

‘I feel angry. I think it’s horrible someone could do it.’

She said she wept for her father, while Eve ‘does not talk to anyone’. Mrs Codling told of her husband’s love for his daughters and how he had years before nursed her through cancer treatment.

‘We all miss him terribly – I lost my soulmate, my lover, my everything,’ she said.

‘My girls lost their cuddles and hugs. We are all bereft.’

She said she takes her daughters to their father’s grave every week.

‘We speak to him as though he is standing there with us as that’s all we have left now.

‘I loved him so much and he loved me and his girls so much. It’s just not fair it has happened.’

Sentencing Egan, who was also banned from driving for six years, Judge Julian Goose said: ‘No order or sentence will bring back the life of the deceased.

‘Death by dangerous driving is aggravated in your case by the fact that at the time you were over the [drink-drive] limit and were in pursuit of another vehicle while travelling at excessive speed.’
