A lorry driver got himself in a pickle when his trailer overturned shedding its load of onions across the road.

Thousands of silver skinned pickled onions were strewn across the carriageway following the accident near Drax in Yorkshire yesterday.

The eye-watering crash happened at around 12.30pm when an articulated trailer toppled over as it negotiated a roundabout on the A614.

Hundreds of black barrels, used to transport the silver skinned pickled onions, tipped out of the trailer leaving a sea of onions across the carriageway

Hundreds of large black barrels, used to transport the tasty treats, poured out of the trailer as the lorry came to a rest at the side of the road and on the grass verge.

Despite the carnage, no-one was thought to have been injured in the crash.

Sean Stewart, 50, from Goole, Yorkshire, captured the scene on camera when he came across the accident.

He said he had spoken with the driver of the lorry who appeared to be unhurt.

Mr Stewart said: 'I've never seen so many pickles in my whole life, I just couldn't believe my eyes.

'It's lucky the pickles rolled away from the road otherwise there could have been a serious accident.'
