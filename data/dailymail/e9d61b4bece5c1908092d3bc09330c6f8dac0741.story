Derby had reportedly grown angry when her son Steven, who is in his 30s, decided to move in with the Guerroro's after having 'issues' at home.

IThe attack happened on Wednesday  when Mr Guerroro, an actor who now lives in Los Angeles but grew up next door to the Derbys, attempted to help Steven move some of his belongings between the houses.

'Honestly, it looked like something out of a TV show. She was just, like, whack,' Mr Guerrero told ABC7 while motioning with his hand. 'And I will say, she hit pretty hard.'

'We finally got the cane and got it away from her and threw it on the ground,' he said.

'And then that's when I ran around and got inside the house. And then we started trying to shut the door. And she was like, full force, coming. I honestly don't know what she was thinking or what she even had in her.'

Hate messages: As well as allegedly posting homophobic comments about Guererro on Facebook, which have since been removed by the site, Derby wrote about disowning her son after he decided to move next door

The police officers who responded to 
the 911 call noted marks and bruising on Mr Guerrero's throat and torso,
according to the report.

Mr Guerrero said Derby had repeatedly insulted him referring to his sexual orientation.

'I was very offended,' he said. 'You just don't go around calling people names because it's just not normal.'

Of the Facebook posts he said: 'She put on Facebook that I had AIDS and that I was going to die soon from AIDS anyway.'

His friends saw the messages and he said he had had to reassure them he doesn't have the disease.

Anger: Derby apparently flew into a rage when Guerrero attempted to help her son move his belonging from her home, pictured, to the house next door

Hours before the attack, according to the Star-Telegram Derby wrote on her Facebook page: 'My son Steven is no longer my son. He has sided with the idiots next door and I guess he [thinks] they will take care of him. He will never get another thing from me or his dad. We have washed our hands of him.'

On a March 10 Facebook posting, Derby wrote that she had two sons who took care of her and loved them.

'I also miss the other two sons who are no longer with us. They were great also. Then I have one who no longer matters to me,'  she said.

Police say the cane she used is 
considered a deadly weapon. The charge was enhanced as a hate crime 
which means the grandmother could be jailed for life.

'She deserves every bit of it,' Mr Guerrero said.

Derby worked at the American Red Cross of Greater Dallas from August 2008 to April 2009 and as a financial officer with Mental Health Tarrant County from June 1986 to August 1999, according to her Facebook page.
