Brazilian right back Dani Alves is proof that money can't buy good taste.

The Barcelona star wore this hideous T-shirt, which resembles an electrician's workshop, at a fashion bash in Rio De Janiero.

Posing alongside his stunning girlfriend, the actress Thaissa Carvalho, he completed the dodgy look with a brown bowler hat and giant silver studs.

Alves is likely to come in for some stick from his team-mates for checking out women's dresses at the Karamello store event.

It's certainly an interesting way to spend his downtime before the World Cup.

The defender is set to leave the Nou Camp this summer to join French giants Paris Saint-Germain.

Brazil
 kick off the World Cup against Croatia on June 12 in Sao Paulo and then
 face Mexico and Cameroon in their other Group A games.

Alves said that although Brazil's 23-man
 squad might not have much World Cup experience they have all played at 
the highest levels and will not be fazed.

'It's a delicious pressure, it's pressure we like to feel,' he said.

'I think that you conquer things when you are challenged, if you are not challenged then it is hard to really crave anything.

'So we look at it positively.'
