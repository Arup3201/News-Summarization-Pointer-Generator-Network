The annoyance of missing a delivery could soon be over thanks to a new 'smart car' scheme that would let delivery firms simply leave them in the trunk of your car.

The system would allow deliveries to be made wherever you are, as couriers can track your car via GPS.

They can then simply open the trunk, leave the parcel and re-lock it.

your dinner's in the trunk! Volvo is testing a new system to give delivery crews access to a car's trunk to leave packages.

Last year, 60% of people shopping online had problems with the delivery of their item.

Failed first-time deliveries cost the industry an estimated €1billion in re-delivering costs, Volvo said.

Despite the rise of online shopping, research has also revealed that over a half of people are not at home to receive online deliveries, leading to further hassle and time wasted through failed deliveries.

Consequently, consumers feels significantly restricted, find their day to day significantly disrupted which results in unnecessary and avoidable constraints on the most precious of commodities, time.

Volvo showed off the system at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, saying it will 'allow consumers to have their shopping delivered straight to their car, no matter where they are'.

Over half of people (60%) experienced delivery problems through online shopping last year and failed first-time deliveries cost the industry an estimated €1billion in re-delivering costs, Volvo said.

The new 'digital key' system allows car owners to choose their car as a delivery option when ordering goods online.

Via a smartphone or a tablet, they are informed when a delivery company wants to drop off or pick up something from the car.

Having accepted the delivery, they then authorise a 'digital key' and can track when the car is opened and then locked again.

Once the pick-up or drop-off is completed, the digital key ceases to exist.

The system is based on the functionality of the telematics app Volvo On Call, which, among other things, makes it possible to remotely heat or cool the car and see its position or fuel level via the mobile phone.

The technology was trialled during a pilot programme of 100 people, 86% of which agreed that ‘roam delivery’ saved them time.

'By turning the car into a pickup and drop-off zone through using digital keys we solved a lot of problems since it’s now possible to deliver the goods to persons and not to places,' said says Klas Bendrik of Volvo.

'The test-customers also indicated that the service clearly saved time.

'We are now further investigating the technology of digital keys and new consumer benefits linked to it,'

The firm said it hoped the connected car concept would lead to other ideas.

'It's all about finding solutions that are intuitive and easy to use and that create benefits in the everyday lives of our customers.

'The important thing is to make these complex and advanced systems easy to understand for everyone, even behind the wheel.

'Deliveries directly to the car are just one first example of that,'
