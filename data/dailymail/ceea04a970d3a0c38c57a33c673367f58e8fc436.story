An eyewitness said: 'He told her she already had enough shoes, more shoes that she could wear in a lifetime and it was pointless buying any more. 

'She started shouting at him accusing him of being a skinflint and of spoiling Christmas, it was a really heated argument.'

The shouting match ended when the man chucked the bags on the floor and jumped over the balcony, smashing into Christmas decorations on his way down before hitting the floor seven storeys below causing shocked shoppers to flee in panic.

Emergency services arrived at the scene but Tao was killed immediately from the impact of the fall.

A shopping spokesman said: 'His body was removed fairly quickly. 

'He
 actually landed on one of the stalls below and then fell to the floor 
so although the store was damaged it meant he didn't hit anybody. 

'This is a tragic incident, but this time of year can be very stressful for many people.'
