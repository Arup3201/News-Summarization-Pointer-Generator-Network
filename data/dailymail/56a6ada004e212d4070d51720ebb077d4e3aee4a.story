Thierry Henry has claimed he was unfairly hounded for the infamous handball that cost the Republic of Ireland a place at the 2010 World Cup while Lionel Messi was labelled a 'genius' after a similar incident.

The France striker used his hand to control a cross before setting up William Gallas to score the 103rd-minute goal that took France to the finals in South Africa at Ireland's expense.

Henry, then a Barcelona player, was heavily criticised for his actions at the time but has pointed out the contrasting reaction when his former Nou Camp team-mate Messi scored with his hand against Espanyol in 2007.

Henry, who now works as a pundit for Sky Sports, claims he was unfairly criticised over his handball

The Arsenal legend told Canal Plus: 'You are talking about people I spent so many times on the pitch with.

'I just said to them, 'Yes, it was hand, I'm sorry.' And you know what? They told me: 'We don't blame you.'

'I saw Liam Brady, the Arsenal legend, and he asked me: 'Did you touch it with your hand?' And I answered, 'Yes, it was my hand.' I spoke to the press that night. I could have ignored them but I didn't.

'I spoke honestly - it was a reflex. A reflex by a competitor, just like when you reach out for the ball on the line when your goalkeeper is beaten.

'When I see Messi scoring against Espanyol, diving to touch the ball with his hand, people say, 'What a genius, now he is closer than ever to Maradona.' But when it was me, it was like I had killed someone.'

The 37-year-old, who is now a pundit on Sky Sports, left Barcelona for New York Red Bulls shortly after the handball controversy, which occurred in a qualification play-off, second leg at the Stade de France in Paris.

But Henry denies that the storm of criticism following the handball was behind his move.

'I have always wanted to go there,' he said. 'Anyone who knows me would tell you that. Also, to escape what? To escape who? I wanted to go as soon as 2009, but I didn't because I kept playing with the national team. That is total rubblish.'
