A pastor charged in a triple slaying at a Kentucky pawn shop had attended the funeral of two of the victims, offering condolences to relatives who say they're sickened by the arrest of the man who seemed to be a sympathetic mourner.

Kenneth Allen Keith, pastor of Main Street Baptist Church in Burnside, was arrested on Wednesday and charged with murder and robbery after the September 20 slayings in Danville.

Keith, 48, attended the funeral of Michael Hockensmith, 35, and Hockensmith's wife 38-year-old Angela.  Daniel P. Smith, 60, also was killed.

Michael Hockensmith counted Keith a friend and fellow Christian, relatives said, adding they were jolted by Keith's arrest.

'To find that out, it made me sick,' Hockensmith's brother, Tony Hockensmith, said on Thursday.

There was no indication yet if Keith had an attorney, authorities said.

The pastor is scheduled to be arraigned on the charges on Tuesday in Boyle District Court.

The shootings took place at ABC Gold Games and More pawn shop last month. The shop was run by the Hockensmiths and Mr Smith was a frequent customer.

Keith also operated a pawn store called Gold Rush Gold Buyers in the nearby town of Somerset.

Tony Hockensmith, the victim's brother, said Keith was the former owner of the ABC pawn shop.

Mr Hockensmith said he believed the pastor to be in financial trouble which was the reason he sold the pawn shop to his brother. 

He told kentucky.com: 'Everybody's in shock. He was at the funeral.'
