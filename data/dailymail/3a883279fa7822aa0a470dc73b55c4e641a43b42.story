Details of Syria's chemical weapons stash have finally been handed over to an international watchdog - but have not yet been shared with other countries.

Syrian president Bashar Assad has agreed to surrender his arsenal under a deal brokered by Russia to stave off threatened US-led military strikes in retaliation for his use of the sarin nerve agent.

The Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) confirmed it had received the 'expected disclosure' from the Syrians and was 'currently reviewing the information'.

As the authorities hand over the information in a deal hammered out by Russia and America, Syrian government troops backed by allied militiamen have stormed a village in the centre of the country, killing at least 15 people, an activist group said.

The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said the attack on the predominantly-Sunni village of Sheik Hadid occurred late yesterday.

The group said the dead included two women and a child. The rest were men but it is not known if they included rebel fighters.

The assault came shortly after rebels captured Jalma, another village close to Sheik Hadid in Hama province, killing five soldiers.

The Observatory said fighting was raging today in Sheik Hadid and nearby areas.

The information will not yet be shared with OPCW member states, such as the UK, because a new process has to be agreed over the coming days as Syria is not signed up to the chemical weapons convention.

A Foreign Office spokesman said: 'Syria is a unique case. It has made this disclosure as a non-state party. The coming OPCW executive council needs to endorse a new process to handle Syria's chemical weapons.

'Once this has been achieved, the OPCW will be in a position to make the Syrian disclosure available to states' parties.'

Once the information is released to the UK, the spokesman said: 'In consultation with partners we will reach a judgment on its credibility. This is only the start of a long and complex process.'

The development came as David Cameron sought to build pressure on international leaders to do more to help alleviate the suffering of Syrians caught up in the bloody conflict ahead of the United Nations general assembly (UNGA) meeting.

In a round of telephone diplomacy, Mr Cameron has spoken to UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, European Commission president Jose Manuel Barroso and the emir of Qatar, Sheikh Tamim bin Khalifa Al Thani.

Mr Cameron has also written personal letters to the leaders of France, Sweden, Turkey, the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia focused on the specific contributions they could make.

In the letters, Mr Cameron said: 'The forthcoming meeting in New York of the UN general assembly offers a strong platform to step up international action to help the innocent victims of conflict and I hope we can work together to encourage others to contribute more to the UN consolidated appeal which is significantly underfunded.

'It is equally vital that this aid reaches those who need it most. This is proving extremely difficult in Syria, in part because of the security situation, but also because of various bureaucratic obstacles.

'We are calling on all actors, inside and outside Syria, to implement the practical actions set out by (UN emergency relief co-ordinator) Baroness Amos for improving humanitarian access.

'I hope you can use your influence with the parties and your national address at UNGA to underline the urgency of improved access, and to urge the parties to act immediately to ensure assistance can reach those in need.'

Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg will lead the UK delegation to UNGA and will attend a UN-led meeting on the humanitarian situation in Syria, accompanied by International Development Secretary Justine Greening.
