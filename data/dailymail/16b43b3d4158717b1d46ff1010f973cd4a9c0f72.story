A former network TV executive filed a malicious-prosecution lawsuit against a former aspiring actor who recently withdrew a lawsuit that accused the executive of sexually abusing him in the late 1990s.

Garth Ancier, 56, who was a high-ranking executive at the NBC, Fox and WB networks, filed his lawsuit in a federal court in Honolulu two days after Michael Egan III, 31, voluntarily dismissed his case. The lawsuit also names two of Egan's attorneys, Jeff Herman, of Florida, and Mark Gallagher, of Hawaii.

Ancier lawsuit states his reputation was damaged by Egan's claims that he was sexually molested by the executive and other entertainment industry figures, including X-Men director Bryan Singer, on a trip to Hawaii in 1999 when he was 17 years old.

Ancier and Singer have denied being in Hawaii at the time Egan says he was abused.

Ancier's suit claims that Egan and his attorney sought to 'smear, harass and severely injure Mr Ancier as part of an avowed and 
very public campaign by Mr Eganâ€™s counsel to troll for new clients who 
would enable them to shake down other entertainment industry executives 
with threats of sexual assault charges.'

Egan's attorneys did not respond to requests by Ancier's attorneys to produce evidence that supported the sex abuse lawsuit, the new case states. Ancier was in Los Angeles and New York developing lineups of shows for NBC at the time Egan claims he was abused.

His lawyer, Louise Ann Fernandez, has said Ancier never visited the estate in Hawaii where Egan claimed he was abused.

'This fabrication of facts in Hawaii 
that never took place, to create jurisdiction in a forum where there was
 none and to drum up more business for Mr Egan's counsel, requires that 
defendants be held to account for malicious prosecution and abuse of 
process,' the lawsuit states.

Ancier's
 complaint states he has already spent hundreds of thousands of dollars 
defending himself against Egan's claims and is seeking punitive damages.

'Mike
 Egan maintains that he was sexually abused by Garth Ancier in both 
Hawaii and California. Prior to filing the case in Hawaii, Mike was 
examined by a psychologist who made findings that supports Mike's 
claims,' Herman wrote in an email. 'This is nothing more than an attempt
 to silence victims.'

Egan 
sued Ancier, Singer and two other entertainment industry figures in May,
 just days before a law that extended the statute of limitations on 
sex-abuse lawsuits in Hawaii expired.

Egan
 withdrew the lawsuit against Ancier on Wednesday, three weeks after he 
withdrew a similar suit against David Neuman, another former TV 
executive. Singer has filed a motion to dismiss the lawsuit against him.
