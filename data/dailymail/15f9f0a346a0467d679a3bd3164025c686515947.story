For professional sportsman, there is not much worse than the serious injury. It makes defeats and mistakes on the field of play seem as trivial as, in the wider context, they often are.

What is often overlooked, however, is the daunting nature of the recovery period. The hours of lonely rehab, the moments when competitive action seems as far away as ever and – worst of all – the often unspoken fear that the body may never quite work in the same way again.

There is only cure, of course, and that is time spent back in the arena, on the field of play, in combat. Only time back in the thick of it clears the doubts from the mind and allows sporting instinct to return. On a cold night at Turf Moor, Sam Vokes took an enormous step forward with a goal that will have finally helped him feel like a footballer again.

For the uninitiated, Vokes was one half of the centre forward partnership that propelled Burnley towards promotion from the Championship last season. While the other half, England's Danny Ings, has been busy cementing his reputation in the Barclays Premier League recently, Vokes has been recovering from a cruciate knee injury suffered last March.

The Welshman's contribution this season had been 10 unremarkable minutes as a substitute in the home defeat by Liverpool on Boxing Day. Burnley manager Sean Dyche, aware of the dangers associated with the specific injury, had been holding back a player who had started to strain at his leash.

Vokes was given another opportunity as his team trailed to Tottenham and, only 13 minutes after coming on, he watched a cross arrive from the right side and then simply let instinct take over, swivelling naturally to sweep the ball right-footed across goalkeeper Michel Vorm and in to the far corner of the goal.

For Vokes it was a landmark moment and it may well transpire to be so for Burnley, too. For parts of this season so far, Dyche's team have looked a little short of goal scoring threat and, despite the recent efforts of Ashley Barnes, the sight of Vokes and Ings back in harness can only brighten the mood in this part of Lancashire.

'When someone has waited that long to come back from a very serious injury, this is fantastic,' said Dyche.

'We are delighted to see him back. It's very important we look after his recovery but this is a huge step on his journey.'

For the neutrals, it was just good to have a story, something to talk about. For almost an hour, this was perhaps one of the worst games of football this stadium has ever witnessed.

Is it possible for nothing to happen in a whole half of professional football? Perhaps not. But certainly there was nothing of significance. No shots on target, no saves (obviously) and nothing that remotely resembled progressive intelligent football.

Both managers had picked strong teams and deserve credit for that. Not until the start of the second half, though, did either team begin to do justice to the decision to take the game, and the competition, seriously.

It was Tottenham who showed first after the interval and their improvement owed something to the half-time introduction of their latest hero Harry Kane. The young striker’s evening was to end badly but initially he was influential, his energy and direct running threatening to bring the best – if such a thing exists – out of the lumbering Roberto Soldado.

Soldado fluffed two chances before Tottenham took a lead they perhaps deserved through Nacer Chadli in the 56th minute. Ben Davies did well down the left side and when his cross found Chadli in a yard or two of space, the Tottenham midfielder was able to take a touch before finishing powerfully and accurately from 12 yards.

At that point, Burnley had shown nothing to suggest they would get back in to the game and had Kane not seen a low shot rebound back from the knees of Burnley ‘keeper Tom Heaton shortly after Chadli’s goal then that probably would have been the end of the game.

As it was, Burnley sensed opportunity as the game drew on and Ings had already brought a save from Vorm prior to Vokes’ equaliser.

Before the end Kane had an opportunity to add to his reputation but skewed his shot dreadfully across goal in added time. This time it was somebody else’s night.
