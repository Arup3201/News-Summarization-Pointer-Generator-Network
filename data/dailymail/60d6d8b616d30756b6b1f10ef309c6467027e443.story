A 90-year-old Holocaust survivor was among nine people arrested by police in St Louis after a protest against the National Guard being deployed in the Missouri city in the wake of the Michael Brown shooting.

Hedy Epstein, who helped the Allies convict Nazi war criminals during the Nuremberg trials after the Second World War, took part in a march from Kiener Plaza to the Wainwright building that houses Governor Jay Nixon’s office on Monday.

The group, numbering over 100, chanted ‘National Guard has got to go’, before several were arrested for ‘failing to disperse’.

Some of the protesters had linked arms in front of the building, blocking the doorway.

As Ms Epstein was led away by St Louis Metropolitan Police she told The Nation: ‘I’ve been doing this since I was a teenager. I didn’t think I would have to do it when I was 90. We need to stand up today so that people won’t have to do this when they’re 90.’

Shooting: Michael Brown was shot dead by Officer Darren Wilson on August 9 in a quiet street

Her arrest follows that of a Getty Images journalist, who was detained and subsequently released.

Photographer Scott Olson said he was ‘arrested for just doing my job’. As with previous arrests of journalists over the past week, no charges were filed against Olson, who by Monday night was back shooting photos.

The shooting of the unarmed black teenager by white cop Darren Wilson has sparked eight days of protests in the once quiet St. Louis suburb of Ferguson.

Protests over the teen's shooting on August 9 had seen looting and violence in the area. Following a brief calm, trouble returned at the end of last week, prompting Missouri Governor Jay Nixon to put a curfew in place from midnight to 5am.

Nixon lifted the curfew on Monday while ordering the National Guard to help restore order.

He deployed the Guard Monday following an overnight clash between armored police and what he called ‘a violent criminal element intent upon terrorizing the community'.

Nixon said the Guard will be under the direction of the state Highway Patrol.

Meanwhile, a second friend of Officer Wilson has come forward to defend the cop, describing him as a 'really quiet, well-mannered, respectful guy', who never showed any signs of violence.

The male friend of the Michael Brown shooter spoke to GMA on Tuesday but asked that his identity be concealed for his own safety.

The friend has been exchanging text messages with the 28-year-old Ferguson officer and said: 'I can tell that this is really hard on him.'
