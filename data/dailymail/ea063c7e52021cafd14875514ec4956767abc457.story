The former head of psychiatry at a Veterans Affairs hospital system in Missouri says he was demoted after he tried to get doctors in his department to see veterans more quickly.

Dr. Jose Matthews told the St. Louis Post-Dispatch that after discovering some of his colleagues were creating an 'artificial backlog' of veterans who needed care by seeing half as many patients as they could, he filed a federal whistleblower complaint and tried to change hospital culture.

Then, one day, the hospital removed him from his position and sent him to the basement to process disability claims.

Matthews says he has faced unfair treatment from the hospital and harassment from some of his coworkers for simply doing his job and trying to get veterans care in a timely manner.

'They’re sometimes mocking,' he told CBS St. Louis. 'There are sometimes people who make it a point to come into my office and laugh. Seriously, this is not a joke.'

Dr. Jose Mathews, the former chief of psychiatry at the VA hospital in St. Louis, Missouri, claims he was demoted because of a staff 'mutiny' following his efforts to make employees work harder and more efficiently

Veterans sometimes wait a month or longer for mental health treatment at this St. Louis VA hospital because of some doctors' lazy work load, Mathews claims. 'No one is working even close to a reasonable day's work'

Matthews became chief of psychiatry at the VA St. Louis Health Care System in St. Louis, Missouri, from November 2012. He says he spent nine months trying to get his colleagues to increase their workload before he was demoted and was semi-successful.

When he arrived, doctors in his department were seeing only six patients a day, when they should being seeing 12, he told reporters. 

'No one is working even close to a reasonable day’s work,' Mathews told the St. Louis Post-Dispatch. 'It seems like that’s the norm here, and everyone seems to be OK 
with it except the veterans.'

Veterans sometimes waited a month or more to be seen because of colleagues' lackadaisical attitude toward providing veterans with efficient care.

By the time he was shipped out of his office and into the basement, his colleagues were seeing nine patients a day, but it's still not enough, he says.

'We take these allegations seriously,' hospital spokeswoman Marcena Gunter said in a statement after Matthews went to the press with his story.

'The St. Louis VA Medical Center leadership is aware of and is 
addressing the alleged issues,' she said.

Missouri Senators Roy Blunt and Claire McCaskill have already sent a letter to Veterans Affairs Secretary Eric Shinseki asking the VA to reveal the exact number of psychiatric patients the St. Louis hospital system is seeing per day and what the hospitals are doing to reduce appointment wait times.

If Matthews' claims are true, they 'would demonstrate an unacceptable lack of leadership at the
 VA in St. Louis that is putting the health and safety of veterans at 
risk,' the Senators told Shinseki.

Mismanagement of veterans care at the St. Louis VA hospital is among one of several complaints lodged at VA officials this month.

Reports that employees at a Phoenix, Arizona, VA facility created secret waiting lists that potentially contributed to the deaths of 40 veterans has rocked the Obama administration.

'This is a growing list of problems that our veterans should not have to deal with, that Congress should not in any way let these issues go uninvestigated,' Missouri Senator Blunt said of the St. Louis controversy in a statement to reporters

'This is a growing list of problems that our veterans should not have to deal with, that Congress should not in any way let these issues go uninvestigated,' Blunt said of the St. Louis controversy in a statement to reporters.

Blunt said Shinseki should investigate the allegation. If he won't sanction an investigation, Blunt said, 'somebody else' should.

The American Legion has called for Shinseki to step down amid the 
controversy, and the White House forced the VA's Under Secretary for 
Health Robert Petzel to step down even though he was already set to 
retire this year.

The VA is doing an internal review of its hospitals practices in conjunction with the White House in light of recent allegations. The VA Inspector General's office is doing its own review and expects to conclude its work in August.

Problems with poor care at VA hospitals goes back years, however, a report on Monday concluded, and previous complaints and investigations have done little to make the government to act.
