In court: Tariq Jahan holds a picture of his son Haroon after his death. He has been charged following a road rage incident

His dignified plea for calm just hours after the death of his son at the height of this summer’s looting was credited with averting a race riot.

Tariq Jahan, 46, was praised by police, the Prime Minister and media alike for his decisive intervention in the street where, hours earlier, he had cradled his dying son, Haroon, 21.

Even last week he was described as a ‘hero’ by shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper and days ago he was handed a Pride of Britain award by a national newspaper.

But Mr Jahan delivered his call for calm while facing charges over an alleged attack which left a man seriously injured, it has emerged.

Mr Jahan, who met the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge during their visit to Birmingham after the riots, is said to have punched a man in the face, breaking his jaw, in an alleged road rage incident in July.

He was originally arrested on suspicion of wounding with intent to cause grievous bodily harm – which carries a maximum penalty of life imprisonment – but now faces the lesser charge of inflicting grievous bodily harm without intent.

Mr Jahan’s son and two friends were killed as they tried to defend a petrol station against looters on August 10 in Winson Green.

Birmingham was left a tinderbox after it was confirmed that a man arrested on suspicion of murdering the Asians was black.

It was then that Mr Jahan stepped 
forward, telling a crowd: ‘I lost my son. Blacks, Asians, whites, we all
live in the same community. Why do we have to kill one another? Why are
we doing this? Step forward if you want to lose your sons. Otherwise, 
calm down and go home – please.’

West Midlands Police chief constable 
Chris Sims described the appeal for calm as a ‘powerful, generous and 
decisive intervention’.

Another senior officer admitted that 
the speech ‘turned the tide’. David Cameron told MPs ‘everyone will have
been impressed’ by Mr Jahan’s ‘brave words’.

The West Midlands Crown Prosecution Service confirmed that Mr Jahan is charged with inflicting GBH without intent.
