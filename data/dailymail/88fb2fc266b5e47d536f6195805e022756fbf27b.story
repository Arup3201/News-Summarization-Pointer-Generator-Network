In May 1943, an audacious raid by the RAF's 617 squadron destroyed the industrial heart of Nazi Germany. Twelve years later, it was immortalised on film.

Now, never-before-seen photographs from the set of classic movie The Dam Busters have emerged ahead of the 70th anniversary, on Thursday, of the legendary World War II mission.

The backstage images give a new insight into how the famous attack on the Ruhr dams was recreated for the 1955 film.

One shows a scenery artist at work on a small-scale model of the Edersee Dam, which the RAF Lancasters breached with their bouncing bombs.

The movie told the story of the 1943 raid by RAF 617 squadron, whose Lancaster bombers breached dams in the Ruhr valley, including the Edersee

Part of the film was shot in Borehamwood, Hertfordshire. Celebrations are planned across the country this week to mark the 70th anniversary of the Dambusters mission, including a flypast from one of the aircraft involved

The collection's owner, who wants to 
remain anonymous, compiled the stack of black and white images while 
researching a book about the Dambusters.

He was given the images by the film company, with assistance from actors, air crew and production workers.

His book never made it into print as 
another beat it to the publishers - and his photos remained unseen by 
the wider public until now.

The classic Dam Busters film, directed
by Michael Anderson, starred Michael Redgrave as Barnes Wallis, 
inventor of the bouncing bomb.

The Daily Mail's front page from May 19 1943, which carried reports of the Dambusters raid under the headline: 'Heart of Ruhr Flooded'

On May 16, 1943, 19 aircraft set out to destroy three dams in the Ruhr valley - the Mohne, the Eder and the Sorpe - and so damage a vital source of power to the key industrial area of Germany.

The strategic targets not only supplied hydro-electric power, and water for steel-making, they also supplied drinking water.

The squadron was assembled by Wing Commander Guy Gibson with only 11 weeks to prepare for their mission - using special bouncing bombs, invented by Barnes Wallis.

They were not told that they would be bombing the Ruhr valley until six hours before the raid began, following weeks of practice over Peak District reservoirs.

On the night of the mission - codenamed Operation Chastise - the 113 crewmen took off in three waves along two different routes to bomb the dams.

Gibson attacked first at the Möhne at 12.28am, but five bombs were dropped before it was breached.

The first wave’s three remaining aircraft with bombs then attacked the Eder which finally collapsed at 1.52am.

Aircraft from the other two waves bombed the Sorpe but it remained intact.

Although the mission was hailed a success, eight aircraft and 53 crew were lost during the raids.

The Bomber Command Memorial was unveiled by the Queen in London's Green Park last June

Britain's only surviving Dambuster has called for the public to support a £1million appeal to help maintain
a memorial to the men of Bomber Command.

Squadron
Leader George 'Johnny' Johnson, 91, is backing the RAF Benevolent 
Fund's Upkeep Club, which is asking 1,000 people to donate £1,000 
towards the memorial as it prepares to mark the 70th anniversary of the 
Dambusters raid this Thursday.

The
club is named after the nickname given to the bouncing bombs that were 
dropped over Germany in the raid, designed by Sir Barnes Wallis.

'As
a surviving veteran of 617 Squadron Dambusters raid, it is very 
gratifying to note the interest and respect afforded to the 70th 
anniversary of that operation,' he said.

'It
is even more pleasing to know that, despite such a long wait, there is 
now a national and very fitting memorial to those comrades lost on the 
raid.'

The
£7.5million bronze memorial in London's Green Park was unveiled by the 
Queen last June in tribute to the 55,573 men who died while serving in 
Bomber Command during the Second World War.

Almost half of the unit's 125,000 men did not come home while 8,400 were wounded and 10,000 taken prisoner.

The
memorial's unveiling came after years of campaigning for Bomber Command
to be properly recognised by Britain for their contribution to the 
battle against Nazi Germany, including Operation Chastise.

Johnny
Johnson served as a bomb aimer in pilot Joe McCarthy's crew, part of 
the squadron which was based at RAF Scampton in Lincolnshire.
