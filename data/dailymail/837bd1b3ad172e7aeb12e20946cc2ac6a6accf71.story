A woman died in the first major snowstorm of the season when she left her car to walk for help.

Authorities revealed a man and woman were driving in southwestern Utah when their vehicle got stranded in the heavy snowfall on Tuesday night.

Both the man and woman left the car and began to walk. Some distance later the woman couldn't go any farther and sought immediate shelter, while the man continued on. He survived the night but her dead body was found the next morning.

Ty March, fire chief for the town of Enterprise, told Kutv that he believed the couple were 'just driving through to go fishing and not familiar with the area and then the snow came in last night.'

'The roads are not very good up there. We had to get up there on snow mobiles.' Chief March said.

The man involved in the incident (pictured above) told authorities that after he left the woman he found an abandoned shelter near Enterprise Reservoir and he took refuge overnight.

He then hiked out again on Wednesday morning. After several miles he eventually met some snowmobilers who alerted police.

Search and rescue crews also used snowmobiles to look for the woman. They found her dead in the snow, a few miles from the car.

March told Kutv that conditions in the area were extremely difficult. 'We received heavy snow until 4 oâ€™clock in the morning,' confirmed March. 'It was probably below zero.'

The first big snowstorm of the winter has dumped more than a foot of snow on the Rocky Mountain region this week and it continues to move across the Midwest.

It is creating treacherous, sometimes deadly, driving conditions and threatening to disrupt some of the nation's busiest airports ahead of the holiday weekend.
