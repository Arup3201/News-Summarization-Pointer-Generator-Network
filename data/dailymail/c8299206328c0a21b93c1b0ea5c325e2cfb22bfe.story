Frank Sinatra continued to look out for ex-wife Mia Farrow long after their split and even more than 20 years later he remained concerned about her well-being, claims a new book by lawyer Alan Dershowitz.

Dershowitz writes of receiving a phone call from Sinatra, reports the New York Post. ‘He immediately got down to business,’ wrote Dershowitz.

‘”I love Mia. We were married, you know. She’s a great girl. Woody’s trying to bully her. He can’t be allowed to get away with that. What can I do to help?”’

When Dershowitz told Sinatra that he had the case under control, he claims that Sinatra said: ‘Well, beyond the legal case, what can I do to call Woody off?’

Wary of Sinatra’s tough-guy reputation, Dershowitz wrote: ‘I nervously told him to leave it to the lawyers, and that any approach to Woody Allen would be used against Mia and would likely backfire.’

Sinatra and Farrow were married briefly during the 1960s, but she Vanity Fare recently that they 'never really split up'

In a recent interview with Vanity Fair, Farrow stated that her son Ronan – born in 1987 while she and Allen were still together - could ‘possibly’ be the biological son of Sinatra.

In the same article she claimed that she and Sinatra, who were married between 1966 and 1968, ‘never really split up.’

News of Sinatra’s keen interest in Farrow’s custody case with Allen over their children, adds further weight to the rumors that he may have fathered Ronan.
