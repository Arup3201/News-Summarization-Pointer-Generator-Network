Neymar appeared to be loving life in a Brazil training session in Vienna as he prepared for their friendly against Austria next Tuesday.

The superstar was all smiles alongside the likes of boss Dunga and team-mate Thiago Silva as they looked to continue their resurgence following World Cup disaster.

Since losing to Germany 7-1 in the semi-finals, and being beaten by Holland 3-0 in the third-place playoff, Brazil have won all five of their games under their new boss - scoring 12 times and not conceding once.

And in their latest win, a 4-0 triumph away at Turkey last Wednesday, Neymar scored twice before declaring that he has never felt better about his game.

'I think I'm going through the best moment of my career,' he said. 'But I don't want to stop here. I want to keep getting better and better.'

It was Neymar's 42nd goal in 59 matches with the national team. He is six goals short of the 48 scored by Zico, Brazil's fourth-leading scorer of all time. 

But he still has some way to go to catch Pele, who leads the way on 77 goals from 92 international appearances.
