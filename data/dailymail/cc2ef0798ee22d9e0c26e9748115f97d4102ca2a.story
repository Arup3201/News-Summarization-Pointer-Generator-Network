Kennedy cousin Michael Skakel walked out of court after being granted bail on Thursday while prosecutors in Connecticut appeal a ruling giving him a new trial in the 1975 slaying of neighbor Martha Moxley.

Skakel, the 53-year-old nephew of Robert F. Kennedy's widow, Ethel, touched his hand to his chest and looked back at his supporters in the courtroom, his brothers among them, as the judge set bail at $1.2 million.

He got his first taste of freedom in more than 11 years when he released just after 2pm on Thursday afternoon after the hearing in Stamford Superior Court.

As conditions of the bail, the judge ordered that Skakel live in Connecticut and wear a GPS tracking device.

'He's one of the most recognized faces of America, so he's not going anywhere,' defense attorney Hubert Santos said, noting that Skakel always showed up for court appearances.

Santos said after the hearing ended that Skakel was 'very happy' about the outcome.

A judge ruled last month that Skakel's trial attorney, Michael Sherman, failed to adequately represent Skakel in 2002 when he was convicted in Moxley's bludgeoning with a golf club in wealthy Greenwich when they were both 15.

Judge Thomas Bishop said Sherman 
failed to locate a witness who backed up Skakel's alibi that he was at 
his cousin's house the night of the murder and failed to find a man who 
challenged a star witness's claim that Skakel confessed.

'This
is the first step in correcting a terrible wrong,' the Skakel family 
said in a statement. 'We look forward to Michael being vindicated and 
justice finally being served.'

Outside
court, Moxley's brother John and mother, Dorthy, said they disagreed 
with the bail decision, continue to believe Skakel killed Martha and are
confident he will be convicted again at a new trial.

'I'm
disappointed. ...I guess we knew that the day would come,' Dorthy 
Moxley said. 'I wasn't completely destroyed, but I wish it didn't 
happen.'

Added John Moxley, 'We have nothing to say to Michael.'

Earlier, prosecutor John Smriga said a 
bail of $500,000 or even $1 million was inappropriate and on the 'low 
side,' given the brutal nature of the crime, the age of the victim and 
Skakel's admitted mental health issues.

Robert
Kennedy Jr., who campaigned to overturn Skakel's conviction, had said 
this week that he felt 'pure joy' that his cousin was expected to be 
released.

Skakel has seen his son only a handful of times since he was sent to prison, he said. In the early 1990s, he married golfer Margo Sheridan, but they later divorced.

'Everybody in my family knows that Michael is innocent,' Kennedy said on Tuesday.

'He was in jail for over a decade for a crime he didn't commit. The only crime that he committed was having a bad lawyer.'

Santos, had argued that Skakel should be released immediately, saying that the ruling makes him an innocent defendant awaiting trial and that he was not a flight risk.

Santos also argued prosecutors were highly unlikely to win their appeal, a contention prosecutors dispute.

The case was considered a big challenge for prosecutors because of issues including the age of the crime and the lack of forensic evidence. Michael Skakel was convicted after a trial that focused on testimony that he confessed or made incriminating statements over the years.

Both Sherman and prosecutors defended his handling of the case.

Skakel's older brother Thomas was an early suspect in the case because he was the last person seen with the victim, and Bishop said in his ruling that Michael Skakel's defense should have focused more on Thomas.

Weapon: This photo evidence used at trial shows the murder weapon, a 6 iron golf club that belonged to the late mother of Tommy and Michael Skakel

Martha Moxley was out causing 
mischief on Devil's Night, the night before Halloween, in 1976. She was 
ringing doorbells, spraying shaving cream, throwing eggs, and toilet 
papering homes in her elite gated community in Greenwich, Connecticut.

The last house she happened upon was that of Michael and his brother Tommy Skakel.

She left no later than 11pm, to walk the 150 yards or so to her neighboring house. But she never got there.

Instead, her body was found beneath a tree in her back yard.

She had been bludgeoned with a 6 iron golf club so powerfully that the shaft had shattered.

Martha had been impaled in the neck with a shard from the shattered club.

Her pants had been removed, along with her underwear, but there were no signs of sexual assault.

Tommy
and Michael were initially suspects in the case after it was discovered
that the murder weapon had belonged to their late mother.

Long
believed to have been bungled from the start, many believed police gave
the rich family special treatment in the case and ignored, or failed to
even look for, incriminating evidence.

Clues? Evidence photo from the trial show a

police investigators of failing to search adequately for clues because 
of the family's prestige
