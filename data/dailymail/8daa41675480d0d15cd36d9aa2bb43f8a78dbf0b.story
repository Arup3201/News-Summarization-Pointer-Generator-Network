A TV producer has written about her decision to eat a marijuana cookie while on vacation in Colorado with her children, suggesting that it's no different from relaxing with a glass of wine at night.

Wendy Sachs' piece for CNN has sparked mixed reactions, with some slamming the mother as irresponsible, while others agreed it's just a new way to unwind.

Sachs, an author who has appeared as a work-life balance expert in television interviews, was on a skiing vacation in Colorado - where recreational marijuana is legal - with her husband and their two children when the slopes left her aching, she said.

'Legalized weed has given aprÃ¨s ski a new meaning,' she wrote. 'So I start weighing my options.'

Vacation time: Wendy Sachs and her husband decided to consume marijuana while their children were asleep on a skiing holiday in Colorado. She asked if it was any different than having a glass of wine

She learned that Vail, where she stayed with her family, is pot-free because the mountain is federal land, so she traveled to nearby Breckenridge to find some marijuana.

There, she bought a $25 chocolate chip cranberry 'Lucie in the Sky' cookie and some THC-infused chocolate truffles, she wrote.

When the children were asleep, they ate part of the cookie.

'I must have consumed more than was 
recommended because the next eight hours turned into a heart-racing, 
chest-thumping, head-spinning trip,' she wrote. 'The potency of edibles is apparently
 unreliable, and they can pack a punch. Who knew?'

But the next morning, after a cup of coffee, she said she was fine to get back on the slopes.

'The issue is really whether a glass of wine or a cocktail is any different from legalized pot to relax at the end of the day?' she apparently wrote in the comments beneath the story on CNN's website.

Review: She said she ate too much of the cookie and was left with palpitations - but did not regret it

Sachs concluded that, while it failed to relax her as much as she would have liked, she was glad she tried it, adding that next time she would be more aware of how much to eat.

Comparing it to alcohol, she also suggested that allowing people to smoke at the resort 'could be a boon for the industry'.

'I would argue that boozing boarders are just as scary and there's no shortage of alcohol at ski resorts in America,' she said.

She added that she and her husband Michael had decided to keep their decision secret from their 'super judgy' children, believing they would not be able to understand the choice.

'How do you even broach the subject of marijuana? Mommy needs her glass of wine is now mommy needs her hit of weed?' she wrote. 'At their age, it's probably best to keep it black and white. Drugs, drinking and sex are all bad -- very bad!'

But she added that they were sure to put their adult treats in their bedroom, so their children would not run the risk of eating them accidentally.

Resort: While staying at the Solaris Residence in Vail, Colorado, Mrs Sachs tried the cookie with her husband while her children were asleep. She said that she ate too much but that she was glad she tried it

After the article was posted on CNN on Friday, it received mixed reactions.

'This wasn't a little puff of weed to help relax akin to a glass of wine or a beer,' one wrote. 'This woman, knowingly ate more than the recommended dose of an edible, and became completely unavailable to care of her kids for a period of around eight hours.'

But another reader countered: 'We all have our ways of coping. Some meditate, some exercise, some have a beer. None of them are better or worse than others.'

'She sounds like she was curious, her husband was curious, and they tried it when the kids were safely in bed. All legally,' another added.

Marijuana for recreational use became legal in Colorado in December, when the governor declared the voter-approved change part of the state constitution.

Colorado became the second state after Washington to allow pot use without a doctor's recommendation. Both states prohibit public use of the drug.
