Rescuers have pulled two survivors from the huge pile of broken concrete left by the collapse of an 11-storey apartment building that killed at least 19 in the south of India.

Seasonal monsoon rains were complicating the search, but rescuers said they hoped to find more people alive after rescuing a woman and a man on Monday - two days after the collapse.

Three backhoes were working to clear the area, but more than 100 rescuers wearing hard hats on site were trying to avoid upsetting the debris, which was in a huge pile of dust, crumbled concrete, slabs and twisted iron girders that could still settle further. Instead, they were listening for sounds to help guide their search.

Diggers clear rubble from the wreckage but are moving slowly for fear of shifting the debris dramatically

'We heard voices coming from the debris' on Sunday, said S.P. Selvan of the National Disaster Response Force. 'Following the voice ... one lady was retrieved alive yesterday evening.'

So far, 39 people have been rescued, and police have arrested six construction company officials for alleged criminal negligence and violation of building codes.

The building crashed down Saturday night while in the final stages of construction outside Chennai, the south-coast capital of Tamil Nadu state. Nearly 90 contract workers were believed to have been in the basement collecting wages.

Building collapses are common in India, where high housing demand and lax regulations have encouraged builders to cut corners, use substandard materials or add unauthorized floors.

Five building firm bosses have been arrested over the disaster, which happened when the 11-storey building was still under contruction.

It was the second deadly building collapse in India within a single day as the heavy monsoon rains had a devastating effect on shoddily built structures.

Disaster: 11 people died when a block of flats which was under construction collapsed

Mission: Dozens of rescuers were deployed at the scene to save workers who were trapped inside

Victim: An injured woman is removed from the rubble of the building and taken to hospital

Rescuers at the scene of the disaster in the Chennai suburb of Porur were today using gas cutters and shovels to hunt for those believed still to be trapped inside.

The building came down yesterday at a time when 90 contract workers were in the basement collecting their wages.

Four people were found dead in the ruins and seven more were taken to hospital where they later died.

As many as 60 people could still be trapped in the rubble, according to police, with some heard crying out for help.

Operation: Diggers were used to clear large concrete blocks and allow rescuers to dig deeper

Help: One survivor who was able to stand up received the attention of the volunteers

Officials used cranes to shift concrete blocks before dozens of rescuers deployed smallers tools to dig deeper inside.

One of the builders, Balaguru, suggested that the building might have collapsed after being struck by lightning.

'Usually, once the construction gets over we install the equipment to prevent the building from a thunder strike. It was nearing completion,' he said.

A police officer said that five officials from Prime Sristi, the construction firm building the complex, had been arrested as part of the investigation into the tragedy.

Building: The complex was located in the suburb of Porur on the outskirts of Chennai

Earlier on Saturday, 11 people were killed when a smaller building collapsed in a slum area of the country's capital New Delhi.

The spate of building collapses has been blamed on runaway demand for housing and weak regulations, which encourage builders to cut corners and use substandard materials.

Last year, India saw its worst building disaster for decades when an eight-story complex in Mumbai collapsed, killing 74 people.
