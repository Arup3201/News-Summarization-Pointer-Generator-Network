A photo of a 'college hunk' is making the rounds on social media websites this week, but not necessarily because of the man's supposed hunky-ness, but for his kindness towards an elderly woman who has a hard time standing up for long periods of time.

When a mover who works for the College Hunks Hauling Junk moving company in Tampa, Florida, became stuck in an elevator with the older woman, she explained the trouble she has with standing.

Rather than respond with an 'oh -- that's unfortunate,' College Hunk Cesar Larios - who is studying at the Art Institute of Florida in addition to being a junk-hunk - got down on his hands and knees and acted as a bench for the older woman.

Larios and the woman waited in the stuck elevator for help to arrive - with Larios, of course, acting like a human chair so the woman didn't have to stand.

'The response to the picture is mind blowing. Thousands of people are 
sharing it and posting it on social media,' co-founder and president of College Hunks moving company Nick Friedman told HuffPost.

'I 
think what's great about it is that it's a genuine moment caught on 
camera. A lot of people say the younger generation has lost certain 
values. But one small picture shows that chivalry and hard work are 
still very much alive in our youth,' he continues. 

College Hunks hires college-aged kids to work as movers. The company began operations in 2004 after co-founder Omar Solimman won $10,000 in a business plan contest.

By 2008, the company moved its headquarters to Tampa and began franchising the businesses.

Today,
 there are 43 franchises of College Hunks Hauling Junk across the 
country, which haul more than 10,000 tons of 'junk' each year.

In
 2008, Friedman and Soliman appeared on the ABC investment show Shark 
Tank with the hopes of finding some funding for the next business they 
want to open: College Foxes Packing Boxes.

Presumably, the company hires attractive, college-age females to pack boxes as the 'hunks' lug them out to a truck.

Sadly, the business partners were unable to get the proper investment to turn College Foxes Packing Boxes into a reality, so - for now - it's a hunk-only business.
