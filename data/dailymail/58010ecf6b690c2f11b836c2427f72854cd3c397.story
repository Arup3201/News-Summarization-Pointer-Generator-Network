Everton manager Roberto Martinez is hoping for positive news this week on the knee injury to Ross Barkley that could mean a ‘long, long’ lay-off for the attacking midfielder.

But Steven Naismith, the man who replaced the 20-year-old England player on Saturday and scored in the 2-2 curtain raiser at Leicester, insists there was no doom and gloom around the club about Barkley’s situation.

Barkley suffered a tear to the medial ligament in his right knee in training on Friday and initial scan results on Saturday morning led Martinez to say his rising star could miss between seven weeks and five months.

Injury blow: Ross Barkley has suffered a knee ligament injury and could be missing for a 'long' time

Optimism: Steven Naismith (left), seen here celebrating his goal for Everton at Leicester on Saturday with Phil Jagielka, is confident Barkley's absence won't affect the team in the opening part of the season

Honours even: Naismith beats Leicester goalkeeper Kasper Schmeichel to put Everton 2-1 up at the King Power Stadium but Chris Wood later scored an equaliser to earn a share of the spoils

These teams have now met 17 times in Premier League history, and drawn 12 of those games (71 per cent of them). That’s the biggest draw percentage ever between any two PL teams who’ve met 10 times or more. 

In his absence Naismith played in a support role behind Everton’s £28million record signing Romelu Lukaku, and scored his side’s second goal after Aiden McGeady’s opener. 

Leicester’s record £8m signing Leonardo Ulloa scored their first equaliser and 22-year-old Kiwi sub Chris Wood got the second late on.

‘Everybody was ready for the game, people weren’t thinking “Oh no, Ross isn’t playing, it’s going to be a disaster”,’ said Naismith.

‘If you look at our bench, we’ve got Leon Osman and Kevin Mirallas. These guys are well established players who missed out. We’ve definitely got enough players to cover it and excel in those positions as well.’

Naismith said the ‘Barkley role’ was also ‘where I feel most comfortable’. He added: ‘Towards the end of last season I played a lot in there and Ross played wider. I grew up as a striker and I still react and move as a striker when the ball goes in the box.’

Martinez is confident Barkley’s injury is not at the most serious end of the spectrum, categorically ruling out that it could last through the season. ‘No, no, no,’ he said. ‘We’re expecting the next set of scans on Wednesday or Thursday just to make sure there is not inflammation in the knee. 

'We’ll know exactly then but as I said medial ligament can go from six weeks to a longer period. In any case it’s not an injury that should rule him out for the season.’

Martinez accepts such absences happen although acknowledges Barkley will be missed. ‘We all share the same problems. [But] it’s important that we get Ross Barkley back fully fit as quick as we can.

Responsibility: Romelu Lukaku was pressed into a full 90 minutes of action against Leicester

'September is going to be a very busy month and without Ross it’s going to put a lot of strains and more pressure on other players.’

Lukaku played 90 minutes he would almost certainly not have played if Barkley had been available. ‘Obviously with the injury to Ross we needed Rom to take a bit more responsibility in that attacking role and I couldn't be prouder of his effort and the way he stayed on the pitch for 90 minutes,’ Martinez said.

He reiterated Lukaku’s huge fee should not be a burden but a confidence booster. ‘The fee is one way to show how much we perceive him, how much we love him. And I don’t think that is a weight of expectation.’
