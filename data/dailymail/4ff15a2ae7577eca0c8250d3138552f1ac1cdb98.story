Google is being criticized after allowing users of its Android cellphone to download a game called Bomb Gaza.

The sickening title sees players earning points by 'dropping bombs and avoid killing citizens'.

The app, which has been available since the last week of July has been downloaded at least 1,000 times with a few people flagging the game as 'inappropriate.'

As of last night, the game does not appear to be any longer available on Google Play.

Bomb Gaza: The game was developed for Android phones and was downloaded roughly 1,000 times before it was withdrawn following complaints

Withdrawn: An extremely insensitive app has landed the Google Play store at the center of a controversy over what it allows to be sold

The game is described as via a series of screenshots. Users score points by controlling aircraft marked with Israeli flags as they drop bombs on cartoon Hamas militants.

So far, Google Play has not commented on the outrage, though a current search through the store reveals that it seems to have disappeared from the catalog.

Google Play is notoriously more tolerant than Apple in what it allows developers to sell in its store, however Google’s Developer Program Policies document, it notes under a subsection titled Violence and Bullying that 'Depictions of gratuitous violence are not allowed,' and that 'Apps should not contain materials that threaten, harass or bully other users.'

Under another titled Hate Speech, Google writes 'We don’t allow content advocating against groups of people based on their race or ethnic origin, religion, disability, gender, age, veteran status, or sexual orientation/gender identity.'

The aim of the game is to 'drop bombs and avoid killing civilians'. It shows a plan continuously flying over a cartoon version of Gaza, while trying to avoid rockets

The policy guidelines show that though the store doesn't allow spam or 'most nudity,' it doesn't have any explicitly stated rules on offensive content or violence.

'Bomb Gaza' is not the only app that deals with the Palestinian-Israeli conflict.

There are a number of other that follow a similar theme which are still available in the app store including Iron Dome, a missile-defense game, and Gaza Hero, which tells users it is a charity game for Gaza that encourages users to donate money.

The game’s dismissal comes just as Israel says it’s pulling out of Gaza in observance of a three-day ceasefire, on the heels of a month-long fight that has to date left nearly 1,900 Palestinians and 67 Israelis dead.

Comments in the game's review section expressed anger and bewilderment that real human suffering could be made into a game.

'Utterly shameful. Real people, many of them children, are dying in Gaza. Many of those who haven’t been killed face life with debilitating injuries, bereavement and without homes.

Their suffering is as real as yours or mine, and to make light of it like this speaks of your essential failure as a human. Shame on the creators of this game, and those who ‘play’ it,' read one comment by user George Coote. 

Another comment on the Facebook page read: 'This is sick. You should be ashamed to have created such an app. Do you really think it's a game?'

The app's withdrawal comes just as the latest ceasefire between Israel and Hamas took effect.
