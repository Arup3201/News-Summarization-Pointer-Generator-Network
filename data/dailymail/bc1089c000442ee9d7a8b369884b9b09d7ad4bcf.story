Talented: Photographer Danny Beath who won an award on the day of his funeral

A photographer was revealed as the winner of a prestigious national award for a stunning picture of a lightning strike - on the day of his funeral.

Talented Danny Beath, 52, had entered the Travel Photo of the Year competition seven times before but never won despite making the finals.

His incredible image of a storm over poppy fields in Blackstone Nature Reserve in the Severn Valley netted him first prize in this year's contest.

But before the organisers could tell the snapper about his win, Danny tragically collapsed outside his house in Shrewsbury, Shropshire, and died of a heart attack three week ago.

The competition result was announced last Friday afternoon, as Danny's funeral was taking place at the same time in his home town.

Danny, who held a PhD in Tropical Ecology had won many awards, including The Shropshire Wildlife Photographer of the Year 2012 and Take a View Landscape Photographer of the Year, run by The Sunday Times.

His latest win would have bagged him new camera gear and seen him travel to Papua New Guinea on a photo commission.

Lyn Hughes, editor-in-chief of travel magazine and competition organiser Wanderlust, said Danny was a familiar face.

She said: 'Danny was thrilled to have made it into the final of the photo awards yet again.

'He was particularly delighted as it was with a British landscape, he had always entered photos from overseas in previous years.

'He commented on our website on how excited he was. We already knew that he had actually won this year, but I couldn't reveal it.

'I just wish he'd known before he'd died, because it would have meant so much to him. He was a great talent and a lovely man.'

His father Tim, who lives in Lincolnshire, said Danny would be greatly missed.

'He was held in high regard by a lot of people,' he said. 'I have had the most incredible e-mails and tributes from his friends.'
