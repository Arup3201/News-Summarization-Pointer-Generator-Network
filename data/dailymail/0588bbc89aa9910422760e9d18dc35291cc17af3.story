Judges have expressed 'great concern' after being forced to overturn the indefinite sentence imposed on a dangerous paedophile who will now serve just 18 months behind bars.

Simon Crisp twice tried to convince a 15-year-old boy to perform a sex act online and shared sickening images of children with other perverts, London’s Appeal Court heard.

He was jailed indefinitely for public protection - which is almost identical to a life sentence - at Preston Crown Court in March, after computer equipment was seized by police from his home in Fleetwood, Lancashire.

The 36-year-old admitted three counts 
of trying to incite a child to engage in sexual activity, six of making,
 nine of distributing and five of possessing indecent images of 
children, and one of having an extreme pornographic image.

But
 his open-ended sentence has now been quashed at London’s Criminal 
Appeal Court and replaced with a conventional jail term of three years.

Lord Justice Davis was among the judges who were anxious about the outcome

Judges
 said that, while they were deeply anxious about the outcome, the law on
 indeterminate sentences laid down by Parliament left them with ‘no 
alternative’ but to quash Crisp’s IPP.

The
 decision means that, instead of remaining behind bars until the Parole 
Board concludes it is safe to release him, Crisp will now be 
automatically released after serving half of the three-year term.

Judge
 Anthony Morris QC, sitting with Lord Justice Davis and Mr Justice 
Treacy, said a sexual offences prevention order handed to Crisp should 
be ‘vigorously enforced’ by the probation service to ensure he doesn’t 
re-offend after his release.

The judge told the court Crisp’s 
computer equipment, including a laptop, webcam and four discs, were 
seized from his home in September last year.

Before
 the equipment was analysed, he admitted to police he had downloaded 
pornographic images of children and had spoken to other paedophiles on 
Skype - but claimed he had no sexual interest in children.

Analysis
 of the machine revealed over 200 indecent images of children - 
including five in the most obscene category - and it was discovered 
these had been sent to other people via the internet.

Crisp had also tried to groom a 
15-year-old boy via a chat website on two separate occasions, but the 
victim had ended the conversation before any sexual activity took place.

protection - which is almost identical to a life sentence - at Preston

A probation report concluded Crisp was a danger to the public and there was a real threat that his ‘fantasies’ about children would result in him reoffending.

The court heard he had a previous conviction for sexually assaulting a three-year-old 20 years earlier, when he was aged 15.

Sentencing
 him, the crown court judge said a five-year sentence would have been 
appropriate for the offences, but that he was ‘dangerous’ and should 
therefore be locked up indefinitely.

Crisp’s
 lawyers argued the five-year ‘notional term’ was too long, saying the 
crown court judge didn’t take enough account of the overall sentence or 
the level of his offending.

London's Court of Appeal heard how Crisp’s computer equipment, 
including a laptop, webcam and four discs, were seized from his home in 
September

Allowing the appeal, Judge Morris agreed the term was ‘excessive’ and that the IPP must be quashed - as indefinite sentences can only be imposed where the offences would justify a conventional sentence of at least four years.

He told the court: 'We consider that the judge’s finding of dangerousness was fully justified on the evidence before him.

'But, by reason of this court’s decision to reduce the notional determinate term, a sentence of imprisonment for public protection was not available.

'We have great concern as to the outcome. But, as Parliament has laid down that the notional term must be at least four years for an indeterminate sentence to be imposed, we have no alternative but to quash the IPP.'
