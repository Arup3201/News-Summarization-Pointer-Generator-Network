Notorious murderer Kenny Noye (pictured) could walk free within weeks after being granted a parole hearing

One of Britain's most notorious murderers could walk free within weeks after landing a parole hearing, it was reported last night.

Gangster Kenny Noye was jailed for life in 2000 after killing 21-year-old Stephen Cameron during a 'road rage incident' on the M25 at Swanley in Kent four years earlier.

The 67-year-old used a 9in knife he kept in his car to stab Mr Cameron as the victim's 17-year-old fiancee, Danielle Cable, looked on in horror.

The killing triggered an international hunt for Noye, who had already served 14 years in jail for his part in the 1983 Brink's-Mat bullion robbery. He was extradited from Spain in 1998.

But  Noye, who was told he must serve at least 16 years in prison when he was jailed at The Old Bailey in 2000, is due to go before a probation panel in May and could be free in weeks, it was reported this morning.

Mr Cameron's mother Toni, 70, said today: 'We're disgusted. We don't think he should be allowed a hearing. Life should mean life for us. He murdered our son.

'We're just speechless. He shouldn't be allowed out. He hasn't shown any remorse for what he did.

'We have written a letter last night to the Home Secretary with our complaint about the hearing.

'We first found out about it before Christmas and wrote a letter then raising our concerns.

'Since this all began we now fear for our safety and the safety of our children and grandchildren.

'The whole prospect of him being released has brought back a lot pain and memories from the time. But if you lose a child that pain never goes away, it's one of the most painful things to go through.

'He has taken away our son and his life. He's taken away the chance of a wedding, any grandchildren.'

At Noye's trial, the  father-of-two admitted that he had stabbed Mr Cameron to death but insisted he had acted in self-defence.

The jury convicted him of murder after pathologist Dr Michael Heath said the injuries suffered by Mr Cameron were 'considerable' and consistent with murderous intent.

Mr Cameron's father Ken told The Sun: 'He left my son dying in the gutter and fled to Spain, I don't believe for a minute he has changed his ways. It's a load of old rubbish. He'll always be a dangerous man, people will say anything when they know they are up for parole.'

Former probation service union chief Harry Fletcher told the paper: 'The most likely outcome of the hearing would be Noye will be transferred to a category D prison in a few weeks. He will then be released into the community with home visits and working experience.

There will be another hearing in around six months' time when he could be released on licence.

'The board will take his notoriety into account and the fact the victim's fiancé is in witness protection.' 

The multi-millionaire gangland killer fled to Spain after the stabbing in 1996 but was extradited two years later.

Noye had previously stabbed to death Detective Constable John Fordham who was involved in the police surveillance in the grounds of his 20-acre mansion in West Kingsdown, Kent, in 1985.

He was later acquitted of murder on the grounds of self-defence.

Kenny Noye first came to public attention in the 1980s when he was charged with the murder of PC Fordham.

The police officer was hiding in the grounds of Noye's Kent mansion as part of an investigation into the 1983 Brink's-MAT bullion robbery, in which a gang stole three tons of gold.

Despite knifing the policeman ten times, Noye told the jury at his 1985 trial that he had acted in self-defence and was dramatically cleared of murder.

The following year, he was convicted of handling Brink's-MAT gold and jailed for 14 years.

During the infamous robbery, six gunmen burst into a warehouse near Heathrow Airport, where they doused security guards in petrol and threatened to set them on fire before escaping with £26million.

In 1995, a year after his release, Noye agreed to return £3million believed to be part of the proceeds of the raid.

He acted after loss adjusters working for the insurers traced the money to bank accounts in Britain and Ireland.

Born in Bexleyheath, south London, Noye left school at 15, but was soon seduced by crime and jailed for receiving stolen cars.
