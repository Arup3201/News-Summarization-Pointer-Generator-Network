A British Muslim fashion vlogger called Dina Torkia, 25, will appear in a documentary tonight about her entry into the international Muslim beauty pageant, World Muslimah.

Contestants are subjected to a two-week boot camp where they take one numerous tasks, including entertaining orphans, medical exams and a psychological test where the women are quizzed on aspects of their personality. 

The contest, which first ran in 2011, judges women on dedication, reputation and concern for Islamic values and community development.

It is held exclusively for Muslim women, who are assessed not only their appearance (in Islamic dress) but also their piety, religious knowledge and understanding of the Koran.

Hundreds of women enter the contest online and 20 finalists are then chosen by judges. 

In previous years, entrants were asked to talk people through their path to the religion and what wearing a headscarf meant to them.

The founder of the competition Eka Shanty says that she started the event to empower women. 

She tells the TV cameras: 'This is about mind, body and soul. 

'Women are supposed to be highly educated and well appreciated - my duty as head of World Muslimah is to empower them.

'It is about the ideal Muslim. I've been thinking about how to put Lady Diana into an Islamic personality.'   

Dina introduces herself to the other contestants 

The event is run as an international charity event by the World Muslimah Foundation (WMF) to benefit relief of Muslim women in food crises, wars, conflicts and natural disasters. 

After travelling to Jakarta in Indonesia from her home in London for the event, Dina and the rest of the 18 contestants are woken at 3am to recite the Koran on the first morning. 

They are then put through a rigorous medical exam which includes giving blood and urine samples. 

The results of the test are then given to the judges, who will include the information when weighing up who will win. 

According to the organisers, the reason for the test is to make sure that the winner will be healthy enough to complete her duties as Miss World Muslimah.

The women are then given a 'psycho test' to complete, which is a multiple choice exam designed to rate their personality. 

Dina is astonished at some of the questions and reads one of them out for the cameras. 

She says: 'One of the questions in the multiple choice are: "I like to participate in discussions about sex and sexual activities," or, "I like to predict how my friends will do in various situations."'

She adds: ‘I think I’ll just circle any old s*** because I’m pretty sure this means nothing.’

The women are then taken to one of the city's slums so they organisers can see how their interact with underprivileged people and how it affects them. 

The next day they take the train to Yogyakarta and indulge in some karaoke en route, which Dina is shocked to see because Muslim women are traditionally not supposed to sing in front of men. 

She says: 'Women aren’t supposed to sing in front of men because their voice is part of their aura.' 

The pageant is judged by a panel of men and women, but the final decision between the best two contestants is made by 100 child orphans.

When the women arrive in Yogyakarta they are asked to entertain a group of children, who later turn out to be some of the boys and girls who will be judging in the competition. 

Dina is unimpressed, telling the cameras: ‘I feel like they’re exploiting kids to make us feel like good Samaritans. 

'They were taken for their home to be photographed for this competition.' 

In another task, the women are given 150,000 rupees (£7.50) and asked to buy three presents for elderly women who live in a local residential home. 

After a few more tasks, the eve of the grand final arrives and a last minute entry to the competition is announced - from Trinidad And Tobago. 

In the day of the competition, all of the women arrive at the studios to take part.

The pageant has several rounds, including a section where they mime a reading of the Koran that they pre-recorded. 

They are also asked series of questions by the judges, but unfortunately many of the children have started to fall asleep. 

Dina gets through to the penultimate round but the two contestants chosen for the final are from Miss India and Miss Tunisia.

The children then each vote on who they prefer and first place goes to Miss Tunisia, who got 51 votes compared to Miss India's 49 votes. 

As Dina heads back to the UK, she reflects on how the competition made her feel about her religion and nationality.

She says: 'It helped me religiously a little but mainly it taught me that I’m a very honest person. 

I also didn't realise how British I am. My British side came roaring out of nowhere.
