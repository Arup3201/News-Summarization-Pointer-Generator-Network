Beachgoers using an historic American boardwalk in the prudish 1950s were breaking the law if they did not cover up.

The problem for walkers in Asbury Park, New Jersey, however, is that the bathing suits ban was never repealed.

Louise Murray, 74, a former city councilwoman, has told authorities to start enforcing the largely forgotten rule once again.

Cover up: Beachgoers using Asbury Park Boardwalk (pictured) are breaking the law if they wear skimpy bathing suits

Ms Murray, who chairs the local Republican party, told CBS that when she was younger 'you could not go on that
 boardwalk unless you had a cover-up and shoes'.

A policeman would warn people not wearing shoes by blowing his whistle at them, she said.

She has revealed that the law is still in force and offenders these days face a fine of up to $2,000 (£1,300), community service and even 90 days in jail.

Ms Murray says she wants to restore the city's reputation for decency and modesty, which she claims is being ruined by the sight of skimpy swimsuits.

She wants beachgoers to put on a shirt if they stroll along the boardwalk, which was built in 1880 and is mentioned in Bruce Springsteen's 1973 song '4th Of July, Asbury Park (Sandy)'.

She told CBS: 'We're going to end up like any other seedy boardwalk in some seashore town.'

'Do you really want to be sitting in a
 restaurant and seeing somebody come up half-dressed? I never 
walked in a bar in a bathing suit.'

The 1958 Monmouth County decree, which has not been enforced for several years, reads: 'No person clad in bathing attire shall be on the boardwalk or the public sidewalks adjacent thereto.'

But calls to enforce the rule again have been met with disbelief by many in the local community, including councilman Kevin Sanders, who views the law as 'archaic', CBS reported.

He said enforcing it would create additional man hours.

'With 
the state cutting back and the city cutting back, that raises taxes,' said Mr Sanders.

'So 
I’m gonna have people riding around on bikes looking, checking 
swimsuits? No.'

City manager Terry Reidy said. 'We’re not going to start arresting them or throwing them off the boardwalk.'

Marilyn Schlossback, a local business owner, told CBS: 'We're a community of free thinkers, of creative people, and to tell people to put on clothing at the beach just negates that.'

And Marjorie Conn told Fox News: 'I totally disagree that people shouldn't be allowed to wear bathing suits on the boardwalk.

'That's ridiculous. It's a beach community.

'It's the stupidest thing I ever heard and it should be stricken from the books.'

There are some, though, that do back Ms Murray's crusade.

One man said: 'They shouldn't be out here all the time with bathing suits because it does not look good at all.'

In the past there were changing rooms connected to the beach via catwalks and tunnels but since they went, people have had to use the boardwalk.

Ms Murray may also have a bone to pick with Bruce Springsteen due to his seedy representation of the boardwalk and local people in '4th Of July, Asbury Park (Sandy)'.

'The Boss' describes people in the song in an unflattering light including the 'stoned-out faces, switchblade lovers' and 'the greasers' who 'tramp the streets or get busted for sleeping out on the beach all night'.

He sings that the 'wizards play down on Pinball Way on the boardwalk way past dark' and says he is tired of 'hangin' in them dusty arcades' and 'Chasin' the factory girls underneath the boardwalk where they promise to unsnap their jeans'.
