The beautiful Caribbean property executive who lost more than £600,000 to a British conman will launch a crusade to alert other women to the ‘red flags of love fraud’.

Nina Siegenthaler, 37, who works for Sotheby’s International Realty in the Turks and Caicos Islands, told The Mail on Sunday last night that she was stunned to learn that Alistair Stewart was an ex-convict suffering from a mental disorder that allegedly makes him unable to tell right from wrong.

Posing as a hedge fund tycoon, Stewart, a Cambridge University dropout, convinced the petite blonde mother of one to hand over her savings, claiming that she was the love of his life and he would manage her money for her.

In fact, the 53-year-old was living on benefits in a Sussex housing association bedsit after serving a jail sentence for offences which included running up debts of £75,000 on a stolen credit card. And Ms Siegenthaler was just his latest victim.

When he pleaded guilty last week to defrauding her, it emerged he had committed a string of other acts of deception. He fleeced an elderly widow out of her savings, and a pilot, a yacht broker, an interior designer and a yacht captain and his wife were other victims of his cruel scams.

‘I now know that I was dating a sociopath,’ said Ms Siegenthaler, in an interview at her office in the Turks and Caicos, where Stewart struck up an online romance after expressing interest in buying a £9 million villa.

‘It’s 18 months since it happened but it’s still all very raw for me.’

Conman: Stewart's own lawyer says he is a pathological liar

Stewart visited Ms Siegenthaler on the island – where she settled in 2002 – and persuaded her to visit England.

His lavish holiday was financed by the money he purportedly was investing for her.

The Harvard-educated businesswoman, who is a leading expert on Caribbean property, reported him to police when she realised there was  no return on her investment. ‘I felt I never wanted to even think about him again,’ she said. ‘But he had to be stopped before there were more victims. The trial has brought it all back to me. I feel physically ill.

‘But I am committed to using my experience to try to help other women realise the dangers that are out there.

‘There are other cases that are uncannily similar.’

Ms Siegenthaler, who has a three-year-old daughter, was apparently  targeted by Stewart because of her high profile. She is frequently quoted by Wall Street and other business journals about property investment. Police say Stewart ‘groomed’ her after researching the lifestyles of her superrich clients. He even memorised details of the types of private jets they used to travel to the islands.

She says he also ruthlessly played on her emotions. When she confided to him that her father died in an avalanche, he told her he had lost his wife in a skiing accident. He even claimed to have lived in the Swiss village where she went to an elite boarding school.

She finally entrusted him with her savings in September 2010.

‘He took the lot and spent it,’ said Detective Sergeant Mick Richards, who investigated the case.

By January 2011, most of the money was gone. Pale from exhaustion, Ms Siegenthaler now works seven days a week, trying to restore her finances.

Stewart has been diagnosed with bipolar disorder and his own lawyer calls him a ‘pathological liar’.

Ms Siegenthaler said: ‘There were warning signs that I was dating a love cheat. I just didn’t know what they were.’ She is composing a list of the ‘top ten’ signs that a suitor is a sociopath. She hopes to issue it after Stewart is sentenced at the Old Bailey on December 19.
