An engineer who was told by colleagues that he was 'wasting his time' designing the world's first video games console in 1972 has died aged 92. 

Ralph Baer, who died this week at his home in Manchester, New Hampshire, first considered the possibility of a video games console while working as a television engineer in the 1950s.  

Over the next ten years, as chief designer for Sanders Associates - which is now part of defence contractor BAE Systems - he started working on his idea. He had his break-through in 1966 while waiting at a bus stop in New York, after which he wrote down a four-page proposal, which he developed into the world's first video games console.

His initial design was a simple Brown Box, pictured, with controlled a Table Tennis game on the screen  

One eBay seller has offered their Magnavox Odyssey for sale including original box for $20,000 

His Brown Box, which was licensed by Magnavox in the 1970s, was the forerunner for the Magnavox Odyssey, which is acknowledged as the world's first video games console. 

His invention predated the Atari, and he had a developed a table-tennis game, before the rival system launched their world famous Pong. 

Mr Baer was born in Germany to a Jewish family and was fortunate enough to leave the country in 1938 to the United States, avoiding the Holocaust. 

The Magnavox Odyssey was launched in 1972 and was able to play around two dozen games.  

The games system plugged into the back of the television set featured hand-held controllers which allowed players to direct action on the screen.

The company failed to develop a major video games division, but made substantial money from suing companies such as Atari and Nintendo for infringing upon Mr Baer's patents. 

The Magnavox Odyssey sold 330,000 units between 1972 and 1974.  

His son, Mark Baer, recalled playing early versions of video games on a small black and white TV perched on a shoe stand.

Mr Baer received the National Medal of Technology from President George W. Bush in 2006 and was inducted into the U.S. National Inventors Hall of Fame in 2010.

Before inventing the system that became known as the Magnavox Odyssey, Baer said he often was asked by co-workers how the group would make any money from the project.

He said in an interview in 2010: 'People thought I was wasting my time and the company's money for that matter.

A 1972 Magnavox Odyssey, with all the various attachments, stickers and controllers has been offered for sale on eBay.

According to the Califonian seller, the console comes in 'as new' condition. 

The box has been opened, although there are no signs of ageing or damage. 

'There's no way anybody could have predicted how fast this industry would take off.'

A version of The Brown Box is now at the American History Museum at the Smithsonian in Washington, D.C. The Smithsonian plans to open a gallery next year with a focus on innovation and is including Mr Baer's workshop.

Mr Baer later formed his own consulting business, through which he created or assisted in developing numerous electronic toys and games. 

In Simon, still in production today, the player has to duplicate an increasingly complicated pattern of lights and sounds.

Mark Baer said his father had patients for more than 150 inventions, including a light gun an dtalking cards. 

He said; 'He had all kinds of ideas. We stepped on the doormat that would talk back to you. He had a great sense of humor. He'd program it, like you can say anything you want, "Welcome to my home," or "Hey, go away!"'

Mark Baer said his father was working on new ideas up until recently.

Ralph Baer: 'If you have it in your genes, it's almost like breathing,' he said.
