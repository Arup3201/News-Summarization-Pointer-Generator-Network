He was notorious for terrorising shipping in the west Atlantic, but treasures discovered among the wreckage of Blackbeard's ship suggest the feared pirate may have had a caring side.

Marine archaeologists have found evidence of medical equipment used to heal the sick and wounded on board the pirate captain's flagship, the Queen Anne's Revenge.

The artifacts are the latest clues of what life would have been like on the ship that became feared along the east coast of America and the West Indies.

The wreckage of the Queen Anne's Revenge was discovered in 1996 on a sandbar in Beaufort Inlet, North Carolina, where Blackbeard, also known as Edward Teach, ran it aground in 1718.

Since then archaeologists working on the Queen Anne's Revenge project have recovered cannons, glass beads, coins, pottery and gold dust from the remains of the vessel that have provided a glimpse of the pirates' lifestyle.

Experts have found an array of fascinating artifacts from Blackbeard's Queen Anne's Revenge wreckage since 1996.

Archaeologists have recovered onion bottles, two bells of Spanish or Portuguese origin a coin weight with Queen Anne's likeness stamped on it, buckles, glass beads, buttons, cuff links, pieces of wine glasses, a syringe, gold flakes, among others.

The same team are said to have also found 11 cannons from the pirate ship, including one in 2005 and another in 2007.

Another rare find was a partly gilded hilt thought to have held the sword of Blackbeard himself.

But among the wreckage they have also found a number of items that would have been used for medical care, including a syringe, a blood porringer, an apothecary's weight set, along with a mortar and pestle.

Archaeologists who have been studying the artifacts say that they suggest Blackbeard made great efforts to keep his crew healthy.

It is a image that contrasts greatly with the pirate captain's ruthless and ferocious reputation.

The English pirate had a fearsome appearance, tying his thick black beard into pigtails, stringing weapons from slings around his shoulders and sticking lighted matches under his hat when he went into battle.

He also had a reputation for marooning members of his crew and enforcing strict discipline on board his ships. 

Linda Carnes-McNaughton, an archaeologist with the Department of the Army at the Directorate of Public Works in Fort Bragg, North Carolina, said: 'Treating the sick and injured of a sea-bound community on shipboard was challenging in the best of times.

'Chronic and periodic illnesses, wounds, amputations, toothaches, burns and other indescribable maladies of the crew, captain, and enslaved cargo had to be treated.'

She added that maintaining his crew's health was so important to Blackbeard that when he turned the captured French slaver ship La Concorde into the Queen Anne's Revenge, he released most of the original crew but forced the three ship's surgeons to stay.

Among the medical equipment discovered on board were a pewter urethral syringe that has been found to contain traces of mercury.

It is believed this was used to treat the sexually transmitted disease syphilis, although the mercury itself would have eventually poisoned the patient.

Divers have also recovered a set of apothecary weights that were thought to have been used to weigh out medicines while a mortar and pestle was used to crush treatments.

They have also discovered the remains of two pump clysters, which would have been used to perform enemas, which would have allowed medication to be quickly absorbed.

They have yet to analyse the clysters to discover what they had contained. A blood porringer - used to measure out blood during bloodletting that was thought to cure some conditions - was also found.

The remains of glass bottles and pots that may have contained drugs and balms were also discovered.

Dr Carnes-McNaughton, who presented her findings to the Society for Historical Archaeology, also said that other items have been found that could have had medical uses.

A silver needle and the remains of scissors could have been used to help repair injured sailors after battle while a brass set of screws could have been used in a tourniquet during amputations.

Dr Carens-McNaughton has used records from the original crew list of La Concorde to discover the names of some of the surgeons that served on the Queen Anne's Revenge.

Blackbeard used his appearance to strike fear into his enemies but the new finds suggest he had a softer side

These included the La Concorde surgeon major Jean Dubou, from St Etienne, Marc Bourgneuf, from La Rochelle and Claude Deshayes, who was also a gunsmith.

She claims that there is also evidence from records at the time that Blackbeard would trade hostages for medical supplies.

in 1718, for example, he blockaded the port of Charleston, South Carolina, capturing the ships that tried to enter.

While parleying with the governor of South Carolina, Blackbeard demanded a chest of medicine or he would murder all their prisoners. The governor complied an the prisoners were released.

Dr Carnes-McNaughton told the Mail Online: 'To our knowledge, he never killed anyone directly, but did issue harsh punishment to some and wounded one of his crew on purpose.

'But the fact that he retained, or kidnapped, if you prefer, the French surgeons leads us to think he had no other medical professionals on board at the time he stole the La Concorde and his men were suffering the ills of syphilis and scurvy and perhaps other wounds. 

'They were no good to him as crew members if they were not able to sail the ship and maintain the business at hand - that of piracy. 

'Medical equipment and supplies and surgeons, may have been equally as important to him as gold was.'

However, in November 1718, Blackbeard was finally hunted down by the Royal Navy and he died in a final battle after apparently receiving more than 25 wounds.

Among the other items to be recovered from the shipwreck of the Queen Anne's Revenge are five cannons that Blackbeard had installed on the vessel after he captured it.

The cannons, one of which weighed more than 3,000lb, would have fired 6lb cannon balls at any ships daring to confront them.

Grains of gold have also been found on the vessel (above) hinting at the riches enjoyed by Blackbeard's crew

Historians believe the largest cannon found was made in Sweden, meaning Blackbeard who was also known as Edward Teach or Thatch, had guns from different countries on board. 

In total, 40 cannons were believed to have been on board the Queen Anne's Revenge.

Since the wreck was discovered in 1996, 22 of the ship's guns and about 280,000 artifacts have been recovered.

Other finds have included onion bottles, bells, buckles and a partly gilded hilt thought to have held Blackbeard's sword.
