Nick Clegg issued a blunt warning to David Cameron today that the Tories cannot claim credit for the government’s biggest tax cut.

The Lib Dem leader revealed his fury that the Conservatives have produced a poster claiming the ‘tax cut for 25 million’ as their own.

Mr Clegg, who earlier showed off his skills playing table tennis, vowed to bat away any attempts by the Tories to steal a policy which they had warned was unaffordable.

The Lib Dem manifesto promised that ‘you will not have to pay any income tax on the ﬁrst £10,000 you earn’.

During the TV leader’s debates before the general election, Mr Cameron told Mr Clegg: ‘I would love to take everyone out of their first £10,000 of income tax, Nick...We cannot afford it.’

But during coalition negotiations, Mr Clegg insisted on the policy being implemented and it will have been delivered in full by next April, making everyone £700 better off.

A poster produced for the Conservative party conference later this month lists policies which the party says are ‘for hardworking people’.

Alongside reducing the deficit, crime and immigration, it also boasts of ‘a tax cut for 25 million people’.

Speaking at the Lib Dem conference in Glasgow, Mr Clegg told delegates they had to be vigilant to the threat of Tories stealing their policies.

He said: ‘I saw on the news this afternoon that the Conservatives, when explaining what their top message is for their conference the week after next, (said) it's raising the income tax allowance," said Mr Clegg.

‘That was our manifesto commitment. It was not the Conservatives' commitment. David Cameron told me - and you can look it up on YouTube - in one of the leader's debates in front of millions of people, he said it can't be done.

‘We did it, not them. We did it. We must never, ever, ever allow the great progressive reforms that we are introducing in this Government to be appropriated by others.’

Taking part in a Q&A session, Mr Clegg suggested the Lib Dems will go into the next election promising to protect the NHS and schools budgets from further cuts.

The Deputy Prime Minister said retaining the ring-fencing as fresh cuts were made to public spending would be an expression of Liberal Democrat values.

The party would suffer at the polls if it was seen to be merely a 'passive recipient' of tough Tory fiscal discipline.

Mr Clegg said he had fought after the last election for schools budgets to be given the same protection as the health service.

'We have done that between 2010 and 2015," he said. 'My personal view, and we will have to discuss it, but my personal view is we should do that again for 2015 to 2020.

'And make sure that one of the bedrocks of our approach, our Liberal Democrat approach, is that as we continue to make savings, as we clear the decks up to 2018, we do not make savings in the schools budget and the NHS budget - which I do not think is consistent with our views.'

It is also increasingly likely that the Lib Dems would insist in any future coalition that a mansion tax would be introduced to ensure that anyone on the minimum wage paid no income tax.
