The spiritual leader described Britain's position as 'realistic', but added that the free world has a 'moral responsibility' to bring democracy to China

The British government needs Chinese money and is too scared to confront the communist state for fear of losing trade, according to the Dalai Lama.

Speaking about recent anti-government protests in Hong Kong, the Buddhist spiritual leader said Britain's lack of intervention was because 'the British government’s pocket is more or less empty'.

While he conceded that this approach was 'realistic', he also said that the West has a 'moral responsibility' to help bring democracy to China.

Speaking to BBC Newsnight, he said: 'China, economically, very much wants to join the mainstream of the world economy. They are most welcome.

'At the same time the free world has a moral responsibility to bring China into the mainstream of democracy. China’s own people also want that … so therefore I think the whole world’s future has to be freedom and democracy. 

'I think the free world has certain responsibilities to stand firm over democracy and the rule of law and the freedom of the press.'

Hong Kong police have just finished clearing the last student protesters from the city's financial district after the largest demonstrations China has seen since Tiananmen Square in 1989.

The activists were demanding freedom to chose their own candidates in upcoming local government elections, taking control of the process away from the regime in Beijing.

The Dalai Lama used to be bitterly opposed to China, having been forced to flee the country into exile in 1959 after a failed revolution. 

However, since then his stance has softened and he now advocates a 'middle way' with Chinese authorities which would see Tibet become autonomous, but remain part of China.

The Dalai Lama added that he may not have a successor after he dies, saying he would prefer that the position dies with him, rather than passing to a 'stupid' successor

The Dalai Lama also suggested he may be the last Tibetan spiritual leader and would rather the post faded into history than be passed to a 'stupid' successor. 

He added that it will be 'up to the Tibetan people' to decide what happens after his death, a remark sure to anger China, which insists it has the right to chose his successor.

He said: 'The Dalai Lama institution will cease one day. These man-made institutions will cease.

'There is no guarantee that some stupid Dalai Lama won't come next, who will disgrace himself or herself. That would be very sad. 

'Much better that a centuries-old tradition should cease at the time of a quite popular Dalai Lama.'

He also noted that the position no longer holds political responsibility, as that was passed to an elected leader of the Tibetan government in exile, Lobsang Sangay, in 2011. 

Tibetan Buddhists believe the position of Dalai Lama is passed from one man to the next through reincarnation, with the previous leader's spirit reborn into a new body.

The current Dalai Lama, the 14th to hold the title, fled into exile from China in 1959 after a failed uprising. He did chose his own successor in 1995, but China put the boy under house arrest and replaced him

After the Dalai Lama dies it is traditionally left to the High Lamas to hunt for his successor, which can take years and involves intense meditation, with the new leader often revealed in a vision.

The current Dalai Lama, real name Tenzin Gyatso, is the 14th to hold the title and took four years to discover, being made leader at just 15 years old.

He did name his own successor, known as the Penchen Lama, in 1995, but China placed the boy under house arrest and put another in his place. 

It is not known where the Dalai Lama's choice currently is, or whether he is even alive.

Since then, the Dalai Lama has changed his position, saying he will not be reborn in Tibet as long as the Chinese regime is in power, saying Beijing has no right to chose a leader 'for political ends.'
