The world's first space conversation between a robot and an astronaut is set to take place later this year.

The talking robot called Kirobo - after 'kibo', which means hope in Japanese, and 'robot' - is set to join a Japanese astronaut into space in August.

Its developers have gathered in Tokyo to demonstrate the 
humanoid robot's ability to talk and it has been answering questions 
from attending journalists.

The robot called Kirobo, pictured, will be sent to the International Space Station in August to communicate with astronauts stationed on the station for long periods of time

Kirobo is a mix of 'kibo', which means hope in Japanese, and 'robot'. Its developers gathered in Tokyo to demonstrate the humanoid robot's ability to talk and it was able to answer questions from attending journalists

The experiment is a collaboration 
between advertising and PR company Dentsu, the Research Center for 
Advanced Science and Technology, the University of Tokyo, Robo Garage 
and Toyota Motor Corp.

'Russia was the first to go outer space,
 the U.S. was the first to go to the moon, we want Japan to be the first
 to send a robot-astronaut to space that can communicate with humans,' 
said Yorichika Nishijima, the Kirobo project manager.

Tomotaka Takahashi, CEO of Robo Garage and associate professor at the University of Tokyo, said he hopes robots like Kirobo that hold conversations will eventually be used to assist astronauts working in space. 

'When people think of robots in outer space, they tend to seek ones that do things physically,' said Takahashi.

'But I think there is something that could come from focusing on humanoid robots that focus on communication.'

Because Kirobo does not need to perform physical activities, it is smaller than most robots that go into space. 

Kirobo's creator Tomotaka Takahashi shows off his humanoid robot during its unveiling at a press event in Tokyo. Kirobo's design is based on the commercial Robi kit robot with modifications for operating safely in zero gravity, facial recognition and the ability to understand emotions

Weighing just 2.2 pounds and standing at 34cm tall, Kirobo has not been designed to carry out physical activities. Instead it is hoped similar robots will one day assist on space missions by answering astronauts' questions

Kirobo is about 34 centimeters tall (13 inches) and weighs about 1 kilogram (2.2 pounds). 

Its land-based counterpart Mirata looks almost identical but is not designed to go into outer space.

Instead, it has the ability to learn through the conversations it has. 

During the demonstration, Fuminori Kataoka, project general manager from Toyota, asked Kirobo what its dream was. 

'I want to create a future where humans and robots can live together and get along,' it answered. 

Kirobo is scheduled to be launched from the Tanegashima Space Center on August 4, 2013.
