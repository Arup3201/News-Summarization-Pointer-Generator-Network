Barclays Premier League clubs will cut the parachute payment time period for relegated clubs from four years to just three under new proposals.

Under the current rules the three teams heading for the Championship are paid a total of £62.8million to help with the transition to life outside the top flight.

They are currently paid the sums over a four year cycle but Premier League teams intend to reduce the payments to three years from the start of the new television deal in 2016/17.

Norwich, who were relegated to the Championship last season, will receive £60m over a four year cycle

Fulham were also relegated from the Premier League along with Welsh outfit Cardiff City

They will provide an incentive to accept the proposals by increasing the parachute payments when the television contracts are renewed at the end of the season.

Premier League chairmen have already met to discuss the proposals and are determined to push them through.

Parachute payments are designed to help clubs with big wage bills adjust to life in the Championship if they are relegated.

Each club is currently paid £24m in the first year back in the Championship, £19.2m in year two, £9.6m in year three and another £9.6m in the final year.

Premier League clubs believe three years is more than enough time to adjust to life outside the top flight and intend to trim a year from the current schedule after negotiations with the Football League.

The Premier League intend to wrap up the new domestic television deals before the end of the season.

Cardiff manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer will be hoping his side can bounce straight back to the Premier League
