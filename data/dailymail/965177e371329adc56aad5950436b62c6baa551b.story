Boisterous, mischievous and reluctant to heed their commanders, these young cadets hardly resemble a crack military unit.

One chases rubber balls. Another plays tug-of-war with old rope. A third yelps excitedly.

But next year they will be among an elite Army team sniffing out roadside bombs in Afghanistan.

They are the latest eight recruits on the Ministry of Defence's new Young Military Working Dogs (YMWD) scheme - dubbed the 'Puppy Programme'.

The furry force will become highly-trained Army search dogs using their keen sense of smell to detect hidden Taliban IEDs, weapons and ammunition dumps in the dusty badlands of Helmand Province.

Troops on patrol carry state-of-the-art electronic detection equipment. But old-fashioned sniffer dogs, each trained at a cost of £20,000, remain invaluable, saving the lives of countless servicemen.

Major Steve Leavis, officer commanding the Army's Canine Training Squadron, said: 'Dogs have a proven track record. They can be quicker than technical solutions and don't go wrong. Give them food and sleep and you have a top-quality bomb disposal unit.'

But before deploying to war, the dogs must prove they can perform the vital task.

The 'Puppy Programme' is run at the 110-year-old Defence Animal Centre (DAC), a 360acre facility surrounded by green fields in Melton Mowbray, Leicestershire.

The Mail is the first newspaper to see the programme, started two years ago by the Royal Army Veterinary Corps.

In the past, the MoD purchased older dogs - usually aged 15months.

But military chiefs now believe it is more advantageous to buy pups at eight weeks' old.

'They are blank canvasses,' said Maj Leavis. 'It's like building a high-performance racing car from scratch.

'We want dogs to jump on chairs, clamber on settees, climb over obstacles. That will be their job, to find what they are looking for.

'If they come to use having been told it is wrong, naughty or "Get off", we have to put in extra time and effort re-training them.'

The latest litter-sized intake are Joe, Jinx, Katana, Keith, Kevin and Kiwi - all Belgian Malinois. The other two, Loki and Luther, are German Shepherds.

Detection dogs are bought after stringent assessments. As well as medical checks, they take tough aptitude tests, including being startled by loud noises and 'find and fetch' games.

Trainers look for boldness, character, agility, a desire to play and interact. Maj Leavis compares this to 'a school's 11-plus exam'.

'We look for robustness of body and mind,' he said. 'Are they investigative and curious?

'Throw a ball, and will the dog have the drive to fetch it? Or will it sit watching birds fly past?

'We want dogs for our most difficult task: detecting bombs. If they don't have the aptitude and concentration, they don't posses the right qualities.'

To the dogs, the training programme, which lasts six months, is simply playing.

One game is hide-and-seek. A favourite toy is concealed and the dog must retrieve it. At first the object is stashed within a few feet. Then it will be several hundred yards away.

Maj Leavis said: 'The puppy who searches for his toy shows an important trait of a bomb-sniffing dog.

If he can't find his way out of a wet paper bag, no chance.'

Later, pups learn to indicate or respond to odours. Once a dog sits by an object with a scent he has been taught, he has detected the 'bomb' and will be rewarded with a snack, toy or cuddle.

Major Leavis said: 'We are trying to build-up their drive, their will to win. Finding the scent is winning the game.

'Eventually, the 'win' will be finding an IED and that will earn their reward. To the dogs it is playing.'

Pups are encouraged to improve their dexterity by climbing over mini-obstacles, scampering through pipes, running up steps and delving nosily into dark corners.

'It's like having soft play areas for pre-school children,' said Maj Leavis. 'When they become soldiers, they will progress to assault courses.'

Handlers also build up dogs' confidence so they are not spooked in unfamiliar surroundings.

Walks among crowds of people on busy Melton Mowbray market days, rides along bumpy tracks in noisy vehicles or strolls near herds of cows help reinforce robustness.

Later, they will be exposed to simulated explosions, gunshots and helicopters - the sounds heard regularly in Afghanistan.

Maj Leavis said: 'They might have good noses for smelling explosives but can they continue to find them when scary things happen?

'We have to replicate as far as we can everything a dog will see and hear on operations.

'The last thing you want is for a dog to feel threatened on day one of a mission, to go to Afghanistan and suddenly discover it didn't like sand or someone shooting a gun.'

Training is done by positive reinforcement. Find the hidden toy? The pooch gets rewarded.

Undesirable behaviour is ignored and leads to a short period of 'time out'.

At six months' old, the dogs are streamed into disciplines that suit their qualities - like school pupils choosing between maths, geography chemistry and English for their A-level.

Some will specialise in protection - guarding defence facilities such as nuclear installations and Army garrisons.

Others focus on detection. Sniffer dogs hunt drugs, smuggled currency, weapons and even poachers' trophies such as rhino horns and elephant tusks.

But the ones who come top of the class get the priority task of hunting hidden explosives including roadside bombs.

Maj Leavis said: 'As with soldiers, they won't all end up in the Special Forces. Some will be drivers, some will be engineers, but they're all important cogs in the machine.'

At 15 months old, the dogs are ready to deploy. Currently, about a dozen 'puppy programme' graduates are in Afghanistan.

Maj Leavis said: 'It's fantastic to know that what you are doing in your daily work is down the line helping to save the lives of soldiers on the ground.'
