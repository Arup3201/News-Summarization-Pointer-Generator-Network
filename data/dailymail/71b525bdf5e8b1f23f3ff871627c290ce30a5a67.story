Roger Federer might be out of Andy Murray’s path at the Australian Open, but there is still the player who — contrary to his wishes — is sometimes called Baby Fed.

Grigor Dimitrov is talented, has a playing style similar to the Swiss, the same agent and, as a consequence, many of the same sponsors, so it is hardly surprising that he draws comparisons.

Now he stands in the way of Murray making his sixth consecutive quarter-final at Melbourne Park as they meet in the fourth round.

In something of a surprise move, Murray’s match against Dimitrov has been given the prominence of the main night match, local time, on the Rod Laver Arena.

They were expected to have been on in the day, but instead will play around 9.30am British time on Sunday morning.It means that, strangely, neither Nick Kyrgios or Bernard Tomic will have their fourth round matches on the Rod Laver, despite huge interest in them here.

Meanwhile Rafael Nadal will make his fourth consecutive appearance on the biggest show court. There seems to be a message to the two young Aussies: don’t get carried away with yourselves.

Every player has matches that they would like to forget, and from last year one that Murray does not recall with fondness is his lacklustre quarter-final defeat at Wimbledon to Dimitrov.

It was a curious performance that came as a shock because the Scot was in form, and to this day he does not really understand what happened.

‘I played great in the first week at Wimbledon. I was feeling really good, I was playing extremely well. I happened to play a bad match and that obviously can happen at any time in an individual sport,’ said Murray, who fairly breezed through his third-round match with a 6-1, 6-1, 7-5 win over Portugal’s Joao Sousa.

‘Unfortunately for me it happened at Wimbledon so it was disappointing but it didn’t take me long to get over, because I was playing extremely well and just had a bad day.

‘You can’t stop yourself playing a bad match. It happens three or four times a year probably to most of the players.

‘I don’t expect that to happen on Sunday, I feel good just now, I feel confident, I feel pretty calm and there’s no reason why I should be concerned of that happening.’

One reason is that Murray feels more comfortable at this Grand Slam than at any other outside Wimbledon.

He has also beaten Dimitrov in their one encounter since, at the indoor Paris Masters in November, although the Bulgarian had a distinctly end-of-season look about him.

For his part, Dimitrov does not think what occured at Wimbledon will have much bearing: ‘I’m expecting a different Murray from that day. I think you hardly ever see top players looking flat early in the match like that; I think it will be a different scenario.’
