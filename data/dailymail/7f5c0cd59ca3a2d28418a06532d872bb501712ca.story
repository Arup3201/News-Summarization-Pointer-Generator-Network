This United Airlines regional jet was forced to make an emergency landing without a nose gear at an airport in Chicago, Illinois, Saturday afternoon after experiencing a mechanical problem, officials said.

The GoJet plane, operated by the major US airline, was traveling from Grand Rapids, Michigan, to Chicago when the pilot informed passengers there was an issue with the aircraft's front landing gear.

A few minutes later, the pilot announced that the plane would be performing an emergency landing at O'Hare International Airport. Incredibly, flight 3645 touched down safely with no nose gear at 3.24pm.

It was the second United Airlines plane to suffer a serious malfunction Saturday after another plane had to turn back to Denver International Airport when one of its tire blew on takeoff earlier in the day.

Emergency: This United Airlines regional jet was forced to make an emergency landing without a nose gear at an airport in Chicago, Illinois, Saturday afternoon after experiencing a mechanical problem, officials said

Firefighters at the scene: The GoJet plane (pictured after landing) was flying from Grand Rapids, Michigan, to Chicago when the pilot informed passengers that there was an issue with the aircraft's front landing gear

Some social media users expressed concern over the successive incidents. One Twitter user, with the handle @j_muta, wrote Saturday: 'United Airlines had two aircraft with wheel malfunctions today.'

The GoJet flight was pictured sitting on a runway, with its nose touching the ground and surrounded by emergency crews, following its successful landing in Chicago. No-one was injured on the aircraft.

Passengers were subsequently taken off the plane and transported to a terminal, WGN-TV reported. A Department of Aviation spokesman told Fox 17 the plane had experienced 'mechanical problems'.

Shortly before the landing, the pilot had reported the aircraft's gear indicator light was on as it flew toward the airport with its nose gear still in its up position, Federal Aviation Administration officials said.

The pilot had first alerted passengers to the mechanical problem around 20 minutes after it departed from Gerald R Ford International Airport, Jim Petzing, who was a passenger on the flight, told WZZM.

In the earlier United Airlines incident, the plane from Denver to Kansas City was forced to circle Denver International Airport in order to burn off fuel after its tire blew, according to officials.

A terrifying video taken by passenger Danny Dodge shows fliers leaning forward against the aircraft's seats while a warning told them to 'Brace, brace, heads down, stay down!' as the plane landed.

Passengers began clapping wildly when the aircraft, a Bombardier Q 400, came to a stop at around 11am. Mr Dodge's footage also showed a tire shredding as the plane touched the ground.

The plane was kept on the runway until passengers could board buses, Laura Coale, Media Relations Director for Denver International Airport, told ABC7 late Saturday morning.

One runway was closed at the airport while the plane with the blown tire was towed. Five others remained open. Nor crew members nor passengers were injured in the emergency landing.

The interrupted flight had been scheduled to land in Kansas City four hours late, at 4:53 p.m.

A United Airlines spokesman was not immediately available for comment.
