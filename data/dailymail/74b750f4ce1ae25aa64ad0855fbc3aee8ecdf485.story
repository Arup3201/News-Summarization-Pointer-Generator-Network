Arsenal captain Thomas Vermaelen is poised for crunch talks with Arsene Wenger as doubt lingers over his future.

The central defender returned to the club's London Colney HQ earlier this week following his exertions with Belgium at the World Cup.

However, Vermaelen didn't travel to Austria with the majority of the first-team squad on Monday.

Crunch talks: Arsenal defender Thomas Vermaelen is set to discuss his future with boss Arsene Wenger

Wanted: Vermaelen is a target for Manchester United and has also been linked with Barcelona

Manager Arsene Wenger preferred for the Belgian, who sustained a knee injury in Brazil, to stay in England to work on his base fitness.

Arsenal's travelling party arrive back from Austria today, with Vermaelen will use the opportunity to discuss his future with Wenger in the coming days.

Vermaelen is a target for Manchester United manager Louis van Gaal and has also been linked with a move to Barcelona.

The former Ajax defender knows his game time will be restricted next season, with Per Mertesacker and Laurent Koscielny established as the club's preferred centre-half pairing.

Likewise, Wenger's plans to convert new signing Calum Chambers into a central defender could be another obstacle for Vermaelen.

In his role as club captain, Vermaelen does not want to be seen to forcing his way out of Arsenal, but sources close to the defender have indicated he is open to leaving this summer.
