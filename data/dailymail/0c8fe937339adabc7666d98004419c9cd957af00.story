An Illinois father has dropped 40 pounds to become a liver donor and save his baby daughter's life.

Eduardo Camargo's little girl Jazlyn was diagnosed with biliary atresia - a condition that occurs when the liver's bile duct is blocked or absent - soon after she was born in April 2012.

After two surgeries to prevent liver failure, her condition continued to worsen and doctors told the family a liver transplant was the only way to keep her alive.

'Right away I said it had to be me and not my wife,' Camargo told ABC News. 'I have two other daughters and they need a mother more than they need a father.'

But doctors told the 210-pound Camargo he had what's called fatty liver disease and couldn't be a donor until he trimmed down.

'We
 use no more than 10 percent fat tissue in the liver as our cutoff for 
donors and unfortunately the father was certainly higher than that,' Dr.
 Talia Baker, a liver transplant specialist at North Western Memorial 
Hospital, told ABC.

Camargo said he hadn't exercised since high school and struggled but was determined to get in shape for his daughter.

Volunteered: 'Right away I said it had to be me and not my wife,' Camargo told ABC News. 'I have two other daughters and they need a mother more than they need a father'

As well as working out, he cut his portion sizes, ate more vegetables and drank nothing but water.He said the running was hardest.

'There
 were days when I thought my knees would give out and all I wanted to do
 was stop, but I would think of my daughter and I would keep going,' he 
said. 'After a while I worked my way up to 6 miles in an hour.'

But his hard work paid off and in 
less than two months he had slimmed down to 180 pounds and lowered the 
percentage of fat in his liver to below 2 per cent, enough to move 
forward with the transplant.

And it was just in time.

A day before the surgery was scheduled, Jazlyn's live began to fail.

Doctors removed about a third of Camargo's liver and it was put on ice and walked across the street to the Ann & Robert H. Lurie Children's Hospital of Chicago where surgeons were waiting to transplant it into Jazlyn.

And both surgeries were a resounding success, Baker told ABC News, with Jazlyn cured and her father suffering no side effects from the transplant.

'The liver is the one organ that begins regenerating immediately after donor surgery,' she said. 'After about 3 months the majority of the donor's liver tissue is restored.'

Now, a year later, Camargo is thrilled to be celebrating the holidays with a happy and healthy 20-month-old.

'Last year at this time, me and my wife were going back and forth from the hospital to visiting my kids, who were at home with my parents,' Camrgo told the Chicago Sun-Times. 'My heart was broken. It was really hard, because you want to have everyone together but you can't. This year, we're actually all together, so it feels really good. It feels really good.'

He 35-year-old added of organ donation: 'It's a scary experience going through it but the outcome pays off. When you see your child running up and down, you know something good came out of it.'
