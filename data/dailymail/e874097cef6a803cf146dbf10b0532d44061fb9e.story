The Pakistani schoolgirl who survived being shot in the head by the Taliban has received the first donation to her new educational charity.

Malala Yousafzai, who now goes to school in Birmingham, teamed up with Angelina Jolie last night to reveal that the charity had received a gift of $45,000 (£30,000).

The 15-year-old described the announcement as 'the happiest moment in my life' in a video played at the star-studded Women in the World summit in New York City.

Announcement: Angelina Jolie revealing the donation at a VIP summit in New York

She set up the Malala Fund after surviving an assassination attempt by the Taliban in October, in revenge for her standing up for the right to go to school in her home country.

Malala spent hours undergoing major surgery at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Birmingham where surgeons tried to repair the damage caused by a bullet which grazed her brain.

The grant will be given to an organisation in the Swat Valley in Pakistan to support the education of 40 girls aged five to 12 who would otherwise be forced into domestic labour.

The organisation, which was not named for security reasons, will offer a safe place for the girls to study as well as financial support for their families. 

Gift: Angelina Jolie revealed she plans to donate $200,000 to the Malala Fund at an event in New York

In a video played to an audience of thousands Malala said: 'Announcing the first grant of the Malala Fund is the happiest moment in my life.

'I invite all of you to support the Malala Fund and let us turn the education of 40 girls into 40million girls.'

Ms Jolie, a Hollywood actress and UN special envoy, introduced the video and pledged to give $200,000 to the fund.

'Here's what they accomplished,' she said of Malala's attackers. 'They shot her point-blank range in the head - and made her stronger. The brutal attempt to silence her voice made it stronger.'

The Malala Fund supports the education and empowerment of girls in Pakistan and around the world and provides grants to civil society organisations and individuals focused on education.

The fund is run by a board of trustees, including Malala and her family, with the support of the Vital Voices Global Partnership, founded by Hillary Clinton.
