The Italian transfer window made all the headlines as Serie A clubs tried to bolster their squads for the new season.

La Gazzetta dello Sport took it upon themselves to rate each team's movements with Roma, having signed former Chelsea defender Ashley Cole, coming out on top with eight out of 10.

The Italian newspaper tell rivals Juventus, who were scored seven-and-a-half, to 'watch out for the wolves' as 'Roma get the highest vote'.

Tuttosport move away from Roma's exploits, and concentrate on Juventus's shortcomings.

They say there is a 'superiority complex' after Juventus 'close the transfer window without a big signing'. They did, however, manage to keep hold of Manchester United target Arturo Vidal, but the newspaper makes no mention of that achievement.

The Italian newspaper say the Serie A side have put their faith in 18-year-old forward, Kingsley Coman, who joined from PSG.

A move across to Spain, and Marca's front page is dominated by Real Madrid maestro Cristiano Ronaldo, who has gave his two cents about his club's transfer window performance.

The headline reads: 'My opinion is very clear but I can’t always say what I think... If I was in charge I wouldn’t have done things like this... But if the President thinks the best thing for the team is to sign the players he signed and let others leave you must respect and support his decisions...

'With the new players the style will change, but it could change for the best or the worse. Hopefully it is for the best as they are players of a very good level...

(Angel) di Maria and Xabi (Alonso) were very important for us, but they are no longer here and we must be happy with the new players. I’m sure it will all go well. 

'Ancelotti has a lot of experience and knows what the team needs and doesn’t need. We lost but there is no need for alarm, we have to let the boss work in peace... Next week I will be 100 per cent for the derby.'

The Spanish newspaper notes that Javier Hernandez, Real's loan signing from Manchester United, will take Alonso's No 14 shirt, and that his purchase will be £17.5million at the end of June.

Likewise, AS focus on Ronaldo's comments about Real's comings and goings. 

The Spanish newspaper's poll states 79 per cent of fans believe Real have weakened their squad, and Ronaldo adds: 'If I was in charge, I wouldn't do things like this.'

There has been a record spending on signings by Atletico, who forked out 112.1m euros.

Mundo Deportivo say Lionel Messi, Sandro and Munir El Haddadi are the 'wild youth' that Barcelona will turn to as they wait for Luis Suarez's ban to end.

It says Messi will share the attack with the two 19-year-olds, labelled as 'killers', and the Barcelona go-to guy is 'at home' with the prospect.

The Spanish newspaper certainly thinks Barcelona are the ones to beat in La Liga, as they have 'six points (from six), have grown in defence, possess a luxurious bench and maintain constant pressure'.
