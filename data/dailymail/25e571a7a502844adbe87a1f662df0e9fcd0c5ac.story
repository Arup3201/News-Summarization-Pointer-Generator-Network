A Russian angler got the surprise of his life when he discovered the mysterious fish he had just caught had human-looking teeth.

Bringing a new meaning to the phrase 'getting a bite', Aleks Korobov thought he had caught a simple common bream until a closer inspection revealed the fish had large incisors bearing an uncanny resemblance to those found in a human mouth.

The 50-year-old - who lives in Arkhangelsk in north west Russia's Arkhangelsk Oblast region - was so shocked by the site that he immediately dropped the fish - although he quickly regained his composure and rushed off the show his friends at his local pub.

Shock: Fisherman Aleks Korobov thought he had caught a simple common bream until a closer inspection revealed the fish had large incisors bearing an uncanny resemblance to those found in a human mouth

Mystery: Mr Korobov initially believed the fish to be a common bream and was considering discarding it as the animal was already dead when he caught it

When Mr Korobov's friends heard that the angler had caught a fish with human teeth on the Northern Dvina River, their initial reaction was to assume it was just another one of his many jokes.

'We know Aleks can tell some tall tales but when he came in and said he had a fish with human teeth we thought he'd certainly been drinking,' his friend Ppal Anton Efimov said.

'But then he got it out and we were totally shocked...None of us had ever seen anything like it in our lives,' the 60-year-old added. 

Mr Korobov initially believed the fish to be a common bream and was considering discarding it as the animal was already dead when he caught it.

But as it still smelt fresh, Mr Korobov decided to inspect the fish more closely in the hope of working out how long ago it had died. It was upon doing so that he discovered its unusual teeth.

Experts at the Institute of Fisheries and Oceanography believe the fish is some sort of vegetarian piranha

Surprise: Aleks Korobov initially  dropped the fish after spotting its human-like teeth. He quickly regained his composure, however, and rushed off the show his friends at the local pub

After showing the fish to his friends, Mr Korobov contacted the Institute of Fisheries and Oceanography for their expert opinion on the mysterious creature.

Institute expert Gennady Dvorykankin said: 'We had to do an autopsy and carry out a series of examinations to determine the species and an explanation for the teeth.

'We are convinced it is a member of the Piranha family, and that it is a herbivore piranha - not one of the meat eating ones you see in films.

'It is very unlikely that it made its way from its natural tropical waters to our Arctic and then into the river, so we can only assume it was dumped by an owner of exotic fish,' he added.

For his part Mr Korobov is simply happy to have proved his cynical friends wrong, saying: 'I don't think people will be doubting my fishing stories again after this.'
