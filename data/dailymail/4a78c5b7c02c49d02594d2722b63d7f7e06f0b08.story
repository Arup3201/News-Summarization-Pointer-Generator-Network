A clocktower which has chimed every 15 minutes since 1872 could be silenced after a single noise complaint from a woman who has recently moved to the town.

The historic market town of Knighton in central Wales has heard every quarter of an hour rung out day and night since the clocktower was built 142 years ago.

But it may now be silenced after 
Irish author Lane Ashfeldt lodged a formal 'noise nuisance' complaint saying the sound was disturbing guests at the bed and breakfast she has 
just taken over.

Local mood: Knighton's mayor Roger Bright (left) wants to keep the clocktower (right) tolling. The noise complaint was made by Lane Ashfeldt - who runs a B&B from the building with the gold window frames (far left)

Dublin-born Miss Ashfeldt runs a 'writer's retreat' at the three-bedroom Offa Dyke House guest house, which overlooks he clocktower in a small square in the centre of the Welsh town.

The
 five-night, £235 retreats do not follow a strict itinerary, but are advertised
 as a chance for authors to find 'quiet time' in which they can write.

Knighton's
 mayor Roger Bright is leading a campaign to keep the bells tolling, 
saying: 'The whole town is up in arms about this.'

'If a person lived near Big Ben in 
London and complained about it chiming would the authorities stop it 
overnight? No, they wouldn’t,' he added.

'This clock has been there for over 140 
years and it’s been striking every 15 minutes for all that time - it’s 
part of our heritage. I once lived near the clock for 10 years and it 
never bothered me,' Mr Bright added.

The clock chimes one bell at 15 minutes past the hour, twice at half-past, three times at quarter to the hour and four times on the hour, while second bell also marks each hour that passes.

Since 1873 the tower bell has clocked 
up more than 13,586,760 chimes - but there are fears the chime may soon 
be silenced at night following Miss Ashfeldt's complaint.

Mr Bright said Knighton's town council is 'very strongly opposed' to the chime being silenced at night.

However, council officials say they have a duty to properly investigate any complaint - even if it has only been made by one person.

Mr
 Bright said: 'The complaint has come from someone who has bought a 
B&B close to the clock tower and she is complaining about the noise 
for the guests as much as anything.'

'But there was a hotel for many years even closer to the clock tower and no one complained about it then,' he added.

'It’s a normal chime of a clock which people get used to and we would miss it terribly at night if it was silenced,' he went on.

'The woman doesn’t realise the feeling of the town I don’t think. The genuine opinion of the town is if they don’t like it they shouldn’t be there,' Mr Bright said.

One local resident who did not want to be named said Miss Ashfeldt should have realised when viewing 
the house that the clock would chime.

He said: 'The whole town is up in arms - she is a newcomer and has only been her for a year.

'When
 you come and look at a property you must hear the clock striking 
because it happens every 15 minutes... If you don’t like it then you 
don’t move into the house,' the resident added.

'This
 has upset a great many people in the town and I hope she now realises 
it is part of the history and fabric of the community,' he went on.

Powys Council confirmed it was investigating the issue and was also in contact with the Welsh government’s heritage body Cadw - the equivalent of English Heritage.

A Powys council spokesperson said: 'Our environmental health team received a noise nuisance complaint regarding Knighton’s town clock.'

'Environmental health officers begun an investigation and found that the council was responsible for the town clock.'

'The environmental health team has referred the matter to the department responsible for the town clock and have suggested possible solutions to minimise the noise.

'These solutions are being considered currently in consultation with Cadw, the local member and the town council.'

Miss Ashfeldt declined to comment when contacted about the complaint.
