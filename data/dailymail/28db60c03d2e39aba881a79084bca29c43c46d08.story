A 19-year-old who burnt a £17,000 replica Iron Age roundhouse to the ground in a drunken arson attack has been jailed for 16 months.

Oliver Harrisyn set fire to the education centre, which was visited by 15,000 children every year, using a cigarette lighter after a night out.

The thatched hut, which was also transformed into a Santa’s grotto during the festive season, was burned to the ground just weeks before Christmas on November 17 last year.

Before: The roundhouse was used as an education centre and would be transformed into a Santa's grotto over Christmas

After: The thatched hut was destroyed when Oliver Harrisyn, 19, drunkenly started a blaze

The replica roundhouse was set in 56 acres of woodland in Ewhurst, Surrey and was designed to replicate the dwellings people lived in between 800 BC and the Roman invasion in 43 AD.

David Quoroll, director of the Sayers Croft Trust, told Guildford Crown Court he was 'moved to tears' when he found the smoldering remains of the building after Harrisyn’s attack.

Mr Quoroll also claimed he had trouble convincing schools and parents that the educational site was safe for children in the months after it had been gutted.

Prosecutor Saul Herman said: 'The damage caused was extensive. The financial damage is put at around £17,000 pounds.

Devastated: The gutted dwelling was built by volunteers who spent hundreds of hours of their own time constructing the home which showed how people lived between 800 BC and the Roman invasion in 43 AD

'The building had been constructed by members of the community and had taken many hours of voluntary work.

'The insured value was nothing compared to the hours of work which people had put in to the project.'

Harrisyn’s defence barrister Phillip Rule claimed his client’s mother was an alcoholic and that he had suffered with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) as a child.

He said the19-year-old was 'extremely ashamed and remorseful' and added: 'These were the actions of a child behaving in a childish manner.'

Mr Rule said his client had voluntarily gone to the police 11 days after the blaze to admit his crime.

'He is a polite and quiet young man but I would submit he is immature,' the barrister said.

Judge Christopher Critchlow sentenced Harrisyn to 16 months in prison and said: 'There was an Iron Age roundhouse that many people had spent many hours building.

'In what can only be described as an act of wanton vandalism, because of your visit it was burned to the ground effectively.

'You went there having consumed beer and under intoxication.

'For some reason, you decided as a smoker to take out your lighter and lit some hessian fabric.

'The effects were the destruction of this replica fort and some 17,000 pounds of damage.

'Arson is always regarded as a serious offence. This was not in a built-up area but it was vulnerable and it was obvious to anybody that it was a building of some special significance.

The court heard a new Iron Age roundhouse has been constructed on the Sayers Croft Centre site after dozens of volunteers pitched in to build a new one this year.
