An army reservist who died after falling ill during SAS selection training in the Brecon Beacons earlier this month 'adored the army' and believed passionately in his duty, his family have said.

Corporal James Dunsby, 31, died yesterday in hospital where he had been in a serious condition after falling ill during the exercise on July 13, one of the hottest days of the year.

His death follows that of colleagues Edward John Maher and Lance Corporal Craig John Roberts, who also lost their lives after collapsing during the military exercise on south Wales' highest mountain.

James Dunsby was today named as the third army reservist to have died during a training exercise in the Brecon Beacons

In a statement issued through the 
Ministry of Defence today the family of Cpl Dunsby, who was a member of 
the Army Reserves (The Royal Yeomanry), said the 31-year-old had the 
'most infectious enthusiasm for life'.

'He was the most loving and dependable
husband, not to mention the most handsome of men of whom could not be 
more cherished,' they said.

'James was and will remain a dearly 
loved, son, brother and husband. He had the uniquely wonderful ability 
to endear, enchant and captivate all who he met with his naughty sense 
of humour and highly intelligent wit.

'With James as your friend you were ensured loyalty, strength, allegiance, protection and most of all a damn good laugh.

'James adored the army and believed so passionately in his duty as a protector of Queen and country and of the realm.

'James was so dearly loved by so many 
and will be sorely missed. Hurrah and Huzzah for James Dunsby; a greater
man you could not meet.

'We ask to be allowed to come to terms with our grief and loss of our beloved son and brother James.'

Craig Roberts and Edward Maher, who both died during a gruelling SAS endurance test in the Brecon Beacons during the heatwave. A third man who was airlifted to safety has now also died

Brave Mr Maher had served in Iraq and
Afghanistan. Edward, known as Eddie to friends, served his country in 
Iraq and Afghanistan in an elite special reserve unit often behind enemy
lines.

His comrade Will Walker took to Facebook to say Edward was a respected a liked member of his unit.

He said: 'Eddie you will be missed by all, rest easy now and we will all see you at the re-org. Edward
served in 4/73 Special OP battery - an elite unit within 5 Regiment, 
Royal Artillery, tasked with directing artillery fire and air strikes 
deep into enemy territory.'

Naming
Mr Maher, a Ministry of 
Defence spokesman said: 'Our thoughts are with his family and friends at
this difficult time.

'Investigations
are being carried out by Powys police and the army. We cannot comment 
any further until these investigations are complete.'

In
a brief statement released through the MoD, Mr Maher's family said: 'At
this time of great sadness, Edward’s family has asked that they be left
alone to grieve in private.'

Further tests will be carried out on the
two soldiers after 
examinations have failed to discover the cause of their deaths.

Witnesses on the day said they saw two soldiers 'clearly in distress' who pleaded with them for some drinking water.

The Brecon Beacons is one of several locations used by the British military for training, and Lance Corporal Craig Roberts (pictured) was one of two reservists who died while on the training exercise

An inquest at Brecon Law Courts in Powys, mid Wales, gave the medical deaths of the pair as 'unascertained'.

Speaking at the brief hearing was Dyfed Powys Police Detective Inspector Ieuan Wyn Jones.

He said that L/Cpl Roberts had been pronounced dead on the mountain at 
5.15pm, while Mr Maher died at Prince Charles Hospital in Merthyr Tydfil
almost three hours later.

'Post mortems have been carried out and the causes of death are unascertained,' he added.

'Further investigations are being carried out.'

Sources have said that L/Cpl Roberts and his colleague died from heat exhaustion on July 13 as temperatures hit 29.5C (85.1F).

It is believed the group had been taking part in the aptitude training element of the course to become SAS reservists.

They had been tutored in how to survive in hostile territory and were embarking on the testing stage of the process.

The Brecon Beacons is one of several locations used by the British military for training.

Its
rugged and sprawling terrain helps prepare soldiers physically and 
mentally for warfare, as well as putting their logistic skills to the 
test - making it an ideal area for elite forces personnel such as the 
SAS.

Pen y Fan is home to the gruelling 'Fan Dance', which involves would-be special forces personnel marching up the mountain, down the other side and back again carrying a weighted pack and rifle - then doing the route in reverse in a set time

Pen y Fan, the highest 
mountain in southern Britain, is home to the gruelling 'Fan Dance', 
which involves would-be special forces personnel marching up the 
mountain, down the other side and back again carrying a weighted pack 
and rifle - then doing the route in reverse in a set time.

When news of the deaths broke, tributes poured in for former teaching assistant L/Cpl Roberts, of Penrhyn Bay, near Llandudno.

The 24-year-old had reportedly served with the TA for more than five years, including tours of Iraq and Afghanistan.

In a statement issued through the MoD, his father Kelvin Roberts said: “We are all devastated at the loss of our beloved Craig.

'This has left a massive hole in all our lives.

'We
wholeheartedly supported Craig in his military endeavours and it gives 
us some comfort, though great sadness, that he died in the pursuit of 
his dream.

'Next month 
Craig was due to start a new post in the office of the Secretary of 
State for Education and we were all very proud of him.'

In the aftermath of the deaths, investigations have been launched by both the police and the Health and Safety Executive (HSE).

The men became ill close to Pen y Fan, which at 2,900 feet is the highest mountain in South Wales. Army chiefs say the rugged and sprawling terrain helps prepare soldiers physically and mentally for war

Last week Powys Coroner Louise Hunt 
said she will also launch her own probe - which she said was covered by 
Article 2 of the Human Rights Act.

She told the court that, under this piece of legislation, the state had 'a duty to protect an individual’s life'.

Before adjourning proceedings, she 
said a full inquest would examine all the circumstances leading up to 
the deaths and examine any 'failings... if they are identified'.

Ms
Hunt also said her investigation was not a 'normal' inquest; any future
verdict given must be independent and have the full involvement of both
victims' families.

'I would also like to place on record my deepest condolences to both families,' she added.

Lieutenant Colonel Freddie Kemp represented the Ministry of Defence’s Defence Inquest Unit at the hearing.

He said the military’s casualty visiting unit had been working closely with all the families affected.

Proceedings were adjourned until September 3, when they will resume for a pre-inquest hearing at Aberdare Coroner’s Court.

Ms Hunt said: 'Hopefully the police and HSE will give me an update on their investigations.'
