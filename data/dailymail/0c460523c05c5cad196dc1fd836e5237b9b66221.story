Christmas is a time for laughter, and the Germans have taken the time to show their famous sense of humour with a video of the top 10 funniest moments of the Bundesliga season so far.

Among those to feature in the countdown are Bayern Munich star Bastian Schweinsteiger, Wolfsburg's Kevin de Bruyne and Borussia Monchengladbach's Christoph Kramer.

And there is plenty to enjoy in a mixture of action from Germany's top flight and second tier, with a mixture of mascots, celebrations, unlucky misses and even unluckier own goals. 

The Bundesliga season has featured some real surprises thus far, with 2013 Champions League finalists Borussia Dortmund currently sitting joint-bottom with the season half gone. 

At the other end things are less unexpected, with Bayern Munich sitting top of the pile, 11 points clear of Wolfsburg in second and unbeaten going into the new year.

Here's hoping that 2015 provides as much entertainment as the rest of the season has so far.
