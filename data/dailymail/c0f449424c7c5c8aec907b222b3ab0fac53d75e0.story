It was to be China's answer to Disneyland - a magnificent theme park attracting millions of visitors a year with state-of-the art rides in a chintzy fairytale setting.

But Wonderland, now little more than an eerie Ghost town on the outskirts of Beijing, is finally to be torn down after a catastrophic history stretching over 15 years.

Construction work at the 120 acre site ground to a halt in 1998 due to a dispute between the developers and the landowners and a corruption scandal that went right to the heart of the communist party.

As a result, the huge, half-finished, Bavarian-style structures complete with their spires and battlements and a myriad of medieval-themed buildings were simply left to crumble.

Back in the mid 1990s, developers Huabin foresaw a bustling theme park attracting some three million visitors and generating 6 billion RMB ($1 billion) a year.

Crucially they had secured the backing Chen Xitong, then the Beijing Party Secretary who was being tipped to become the country's next leader.

But when Chen was jailed for corruption in 1998, his successor, perhaps scared of being tarred with the same brush, refused to support the project.

Construction work at the site of what was promoted as 'the largest amusement park in Asia', stopped around 1998 after funds were withdrawn due to disagreements over property prices with the local government and farmers

A plan to restart work to capitalise on the 2008 Beijing Olympics was allegedly thwarted by proposals tabled in 2005, to build an entire city which would have covered parts of the Wonderland site's green space.

Now the farmers that used to own the land have returned to grow their crops once again, with the decaying building site filling the skyline.

Photographer David Gray, who visited the magical kingdom-turned-ghost park in 2011 said: ‘Pulling off the express-way and into the car park, I expected to be stopped by the usual confrontational security guards.

‘But there was absolutely no one to be seen. I walked through one of the few entrances not boarded up, and instantly started coughing.

‘In front of me were large empty rooms and discarded furniture, all covered in a thick layer of dust, along with an eerie silence that gave the place a haunted feeling – an emotion not normally associated with a children’s playground.’

Local farmers told the photographer 
that they have returned to use the land because they say its safe to 
think the developers are never coming back.

‘This I can believe’, added Gray on 
his blog, ‘As the absence of any security (something very rare in China)
 leads one to think that even the developers have given up on what is 
already there.

‘All these structures of rusting 
steel and decaying cement, are another sad example of property 
development in China involving wasted money, wasted resources and the 
uprooting of farmers and their families.

‘It is a reflection of the country’s property market which many analysts say the government must keep tightening steps in place.

‘The worry is a massive increase in 
inflation and a speculative bubble that might burst, considering that 
property sales contribute to around 10 per cent of China’s growth’, Gray
 continued.

Wonderland is far from being the only Chinese construction project to end in disaster in recent years.

Just down the road, deserted 
for over 20 years, a site features Greek-style columns and
amphitheatre. Thames Town near Shanghai, which is based on an English 
town, remains a hit as a wedding venue, but few people have actually 
moved there to live.

New 
city of Chenggong, Yunnan boasts over 100,000 apartments but no 
occupants, while the sprawling New South China Mall, in Guangdong is 
little more than empty, sparking fears the great Chinese property 
boom could be teetering on the brink.
