Two inmates have died and more than a hundred have been injured after an apparent gas explosion at a jail in northern Florida.

The blast partly leveled the four-story Escambia County Jail's central booking facility, which held roughly 600 inmates, at about 11 p.m., county spokeswoman Kathleen Castro.

Roughly 100 -150 inmates and correctional officers were hurt she said, as she confirmed two people had died.

The injured were brought to hospitals and the uninjured inmates were brought to jails in neighboring counties, Castro said.

Castro described a frenetic scene where officials were scrambling to get people out of the building, provide medical care, and working to make sure inmates were detained and routed to other facilities.

She said there was a partial building collapse, a roof collapse and that it is believed that the walls are unstable in the facility.

The explosion shook houses for several blocks and the areas has been quarantined by Sheriff's Office personnel.

Sacred Heart Hospital spokesman Mike Burke told Pensacola News Journal that 31 people were brought to the hospital by ambulances and law enforcement officers are at the hospital providing security as the inmates are being treated.

Kendrick Doidge said West Florida Hospital treated 37 inmates in the emergency room and all have been released back into the custody of the Escambia County Sheriff's Office.

An updated statement on the Escambia County website later made no mention of gas, saying only it was an 'apparent explosion' after reporting earlier it was 'an apparent gas explosion'.

Castro
 didn't know if flooding in the area was a factor but says the jail did 
get extensive flooding during heavy rains that drenched the region 
Tuesday and Wednesday.

Escambia County is located in the northwestern part of Florida, in the southern United States.
