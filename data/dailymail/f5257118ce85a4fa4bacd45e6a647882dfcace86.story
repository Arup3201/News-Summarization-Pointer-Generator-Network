Although Steve Nash says his three-year stint with the Los Angeles Lakers was a failure, the two-time MVP point guard heads into retirement with warm feelings for the team-mates and fans who supported him in his injury struggles.

Nash formally discussed his retirement on Tuesday at the Lakers' training complex. 

Three days earlier, he announced the long-expected end of his 19-year NBA career.

The 41-year-old Nash didn't play this season after emerging from his first pre-season game in excruciating pain. 

He played just 65 games in three seasons with the Lakers, who traded four draft picks to Phoenix for him.

Nash says he doesn't regret his attempt to keep playing through constant back injuries and other resulting woes. 

He says he never wanted something more than success with the Lakers.
