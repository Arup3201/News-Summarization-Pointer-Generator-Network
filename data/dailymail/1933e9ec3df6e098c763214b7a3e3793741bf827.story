Britain's nuclear defence is under threat because the Navy will not have enough people to properly man its submarines, it was warned today.

Trident subs and UK boats holding nuclear weapons may have to stay in port as a result of staff shortages, internal Submarines Service documents reveal.

The Ministry of Defence's official risk register says engineer numbers will also be down by 15 per cent within three years, causing even more problems for the British fleet.

Problems: Vessels like Britain's top submarine HMS Vanguard, pictured, may be understaffed, an official report reveals

One in seven weapons officer posts ranked at lieutenant will also be vacant in the coming years, meaning there may not be enough people to fire weapons.

The Royal Navy is desperately trying to bolster its number of 'experienced' mid-level staff on its six attack submarines and four large Vanguard boats that carry our Trident nuclear weapons.

'There is a risk that the Royal Navy will not have sufficient suitably 
qualified and experienced personnel to be able to support the manning 
requirement of the submarine fleet.' the document says.

Anger: Trident has caused a great deal of protest, CND activists pictured here in Parliament Square, and its replacement programme could be threatened by a lack of experienced staff, documents warn

'Inability to recruit, retain and develop sufficient nuclear and 
submarine design qualified personnel will result in an inability to 
support the Defence Nuclear Programme,' it also warned.

Questioning Britain's ability to replace the controversial Trident missiles it said they are worried about the 'erosion of manufacturing capability, cost growth, time delay, and poor performance of contractors'.

Concerns: Admiral West,of Spithead says the the Royal Navy must prepare for any staffing problems now

There are currently 5,000 Navy submariners but at the moment some vessels are going out for tours with only 85 per cent of its staff capacity filled.

The Ministry of Defence is busy trying to find out how to attract and keep more staff as so many will spend up to four months without leaving the submarine.

Admiral Lord West today called the situation 'worrying' and that the 
Navy must have procedures in place to cope with any staff shortages.

'There’s no doubt that recruiting and keeping highly qualified nuclear engineers has been tough. Nuclear engineers have also become highly sought-after by the civil industry as this country has not trained enough,' he told the Telegraph. 

The Risk Register was handed to the Nuclear Information Service.

Director Peter Burt told the Telegraph: 'These risks highlight major pitfalls ahead and that Trident replacement is far from a forgone conclusion. How effective we are at mastering these risks will determine whether Britain can remain in the nuclear weapons business.'

But the MoD today told MailOnline they were not worried about the situation.

'This report recognises that the Royal Navy has sufficient manpower for its submarines and we are confident that this will remain the case,' a Royal Navy spokesman said.

'The MoD is committed to sustaining the highest safety standards and to maintaining the defence industrial supply chain to design, build and support the nuclear fleet.'
