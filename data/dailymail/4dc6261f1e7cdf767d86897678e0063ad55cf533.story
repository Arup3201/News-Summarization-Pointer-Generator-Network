Didier Drogba told Chelsea supporters Frank Lampard will always belong to them and urged those travelling to Sunday's title clash against Manchester City not to turn on the club legend and record goalscorer.

Lampard is on loan the Etihad Stadium from New York City, the MLS team owned by City which he joined in the summer after 13 years at Stamford Bridge.

'It doesn't matter what team he is playing for now,' said Drogba. 'He belongs to us. He is a Chelsea player, for what he did. He made the crowd shout and cheer his name and cheer for us, a lot of times here.

'It's a pity that I've come back and he's not here anymore but I know for sure I will be happy to see him again. I can't wait to see my partner in crime.

'He's part of the history of this club and the fans know what he gave for the club. They know what he did. So I know the reaction will be good. I know that, for sure.'

Drogba, 36, is a Chelsea player once again after two years away. He returned last season to play against Jose Mourinho's team for Galatasaray in the Champions League. He received a rapturous ovation from fans at the Bridge and found it hard to cope with the emotion, as will Lampard if he plays at the Etihad on Sunday.

'I did it and so I know it's going to be difficult,' said Drogba. 'But I know Frank and he will do his best.'

Lampard, also 36, made his City last weekend in a 1-1 draw at Arsenal and was an unused substitute against Bayern Munich on Wednesday. If Manuel Pellegrini selects him on Sunday, it will be his first involvement against Chelsea since March 2001, when he was in a West Ham team beaten at Upton Park.

In 13 years at Chelsea, he won 11 major trophies: the Barclays Premier League three times, the FA Cup four times, the League Cup twice, the Europa League once and the Champions League. He also scored a record 211 goals for the club.

Most of the trophies – and many of the goals - involved Drogba, who has returned to the Bridge in a role as player-coach as manager Jose Mourinho attempted to replace some of the experience and winning mentality lost when Lampard and Ashley Cole left the club.

'It's good to be back,' said Drogba, who started the first game since his return in the 1-1 draw against Schalke, in the Champions League, on Wednesday.

He has been in pain from an ankle injury suffered in pre-season which has restricted his involvement and accepts there is pressure on him to somehow emulate his first spell at the club, which ended in sensational style when he scored the winning penalty in the shoot-out to win the Champions League final. 

'The pressure you get is when you win something,' said Drogba. 'When we won the Premier League for the first time, the pressure was to win it a second time. When I finished as the top scorer in the Premier League, they expected me to be top scorer the next season. That's part of our lives, and we're used to it.

'It's a different season for me but when I signed to come back here I knew that. I can only work hard and show the manager like I did on Wednesday. I need to do that improve my condition.

'I'm preparing myself to give something extra to the team and achieve what we want to achieve. I'm here to help but I'm also here to show them the right spirit, if I can say that. Even if I don't have any doubt about their desire to win, I'm here to help and I will give what I can.'

Another key part of his role will be as mentor to Diego Costa, the £32million centre-forward who has started his Chelsea career with a blaze of seven goals in five appearances, and has many similarities to the Ivorian in his style of play and his life story.

'He's the striker we needed this season,' said Drogba. 'For him to start the season in England, coming from Spain, which is a very different league, and to recreate the same thing he was doing at Atletico Madrid, is fantastic. He's really good and he's enjoying being with us. That's the best feeling he could have.

'Like me, he came to this level a little bit late. When I look at him, I can see the desire to win every challenge, to score goals. He is hungry for goals and that's the best thing for a team like us.'

If Costa's hamstrings are up to it, he will return in place of Drogba at City where a win will move Chelsea seven points clear of the champions after only five games.

'I hope we can continue the way we've started in the Premier League against City,' said Drogba. 'I think we can and I hope we can. We will go there to try to win, like we've gone out to try to win every game this season. Let's see what's going to happen. The season is long.'
