An increasing number of elderly people are renting properties after selling their own homes, new data has revealed

An increasing number of retired people are selling their homes and moving into rented accommodation in a desperate bid to access cash, experts say.

Overall, there has been a seven per cent
increase in the number of tenants aged 66 to 70 moving into rented 
homes after selling their own properties.

In addition, half of all regions in the UK saw an increase in older tenants downsizing to rented homes in the past year.

Experts believe many pensioners are being forced to sell up to release equity from their homes as their pension pots dwindle and living costs continue to rise.

And, figures compiled by HomeLet Rental Index Data suggest pensioners have no choice but to downsize into rented homes as suitable alternatives are being bought by younger first-time buyers with the help of Government initiatives.

Yorkshire and Humberside have seen the 
largest increase in tenants over the age of 65, while the East Midlands 
has the highest rate with 3.1 per cent of pensioners living in rented 
accommodation.

'Pensions aren't providing the same level of contributions they were 30 or 40 years 
ago,' said Gary Abraham, Director of Sales and Marketing at HomeLet.

'For many elderly people, the only equity they have is in their homes and they're having to unlock income from other sources like selling their houses.'

'The government are specifically only helping one demographic... new houses are being built for younger people.'

While some elderly people may be forced to sell their homes and downsize to save money, others may be moving in to rented accommodation as they feel their 'money may outlive them', says Mr Abraham.

'A lot of the new homes aren't suitable but another thing to consider is that is pensioners could be taking a short-term view and using their equity to provide a standard of living they're used to.'

The HomeLet October 2013 Data Index breakdown reveals how the price of renting has increased less over the past three years

'It appears the demographic of the UK 
tenant is changing. While initiatives, such as the Build to Rent scheme,
are positive moves to alleviate supply, the Government needs to 
consider these purpose-built properties are not going to be suitable for
all,' added Mr Abraham.

'Therefore, focus must also be kept on
the maintenance of existing properties, so all tenants are able to live
in suitable properties depending on their individual needs.'

'Momentum must be maintained though so those living within the private rented sector are offered the best quality properties and security needed as part of their tenancy agreements.'

The report also revealed that though the cost of 
renting has decreased by 4.6 per cent during the month of October to £815, 
tenants across the board are still paying 2.7 per cent more on average than last year.

When comparing previous years, this 
month’s figures show from October 2010-2013, 
average UK rents increased less each year, after rising by 4.8 per cent in 2011,
3.1 per cent in 2012 and 2.7 per cent in 2013.

This is also true in the capital, 
where the rate of increase in average rents slowed down by 2.3 per cent between 
October 2011-12 and four per cent between October 2012-13.

The East Midlands, Greater London and
the North West were the only regions where rental costs increased, with
properties in the North West costing 4.5 per cent more to rent than 
last year, and those in the capital almost 21 per cent more than in 
2010.

'Our new figures could suggest the effect of the economic downturn in 2008/09 is beginning to reduce,' said Mr Abraham.

'There’s certainly more confidence within the housing market at the moment and an increasing amount of first-time-buyers are now purchasing their own properties as a result of increased lending and mortgage availability.'

'Recent reports suggest the Build to Rent scheme will improve the private rented sector by boosting the supply of buy-to-let homes within the market.

'Properties rented with longer-term tenancies as part of this scheme aim to not only offer additional security to tenants and their families, but also curb spiralling rents recorded over the past few years.'
