Police said on Sunday that the woman had yet to be formally identified.

The toilet block where she was found was cordoned off yesterday as officers investigated the scene. Her death is not believed to be suspicious at this time, police said.

A statement from Hampshire Police said: 'It is too early to speculate on cause of death, and a post-mortem examination will be conducted in due course to help determine this.

'Police are providing support to her family including her husband, who was at the festival with her.'

BoomTown Fair is a music festival where acts and music are divided between nine different districts - each with their own theme or style.

The woman was found dead in TrenchTown, which 'boasts the best in dub, reggae, dancehall and jungle', according to the festival website.

A spokesperson for the festival said: 'BoomTown fair would like to express their sincerest condolences to the family of the young woman who was found unconscious on site but despite the efforts of all our staff involved she was later pronounced dead shortly after arriving at Winchester hospital.

'Our thoughts are with all her loved ones at this tragic time and the festival is doing all it can to assist those involved.'
