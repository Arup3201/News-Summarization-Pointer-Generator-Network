A Catholic priest accidentally showed a slideshow of gay porn images during a presentation at a primary school.

Father Martin McVeigh reacted in horror as the slideshow of X-rated pictures popped up on screen automatically when he inserted his USB stick into the computer.

The priest was talking to parents about going to Confession in Pomeroy, Northern Ireland, when the images autoplayed.

He claimed he did not know the images were on the memory stick.

Parents who attended the gathering on 
March 26 said ‘approximately 16 indecent images of men’ were shown 
before the priest removed the USB stick.

One eight-year-old was also present at the meeting.

Police were called following the incident at St Mary's School but officers said no crime had been committed.

In a statement the parents said: 'He was visibly shaken and flustered.

‘He gave no explanation or apology to the group and bolted out of the room.

'Twenty minutes later he returned, continued with the meeting and wrapped up by saying children get lots of money for their Holy Communion and should consider giving some to the Church.’

Cardinal Seán Brady confirmed that offensive imagery was ‘inadvertently’ shown to parents.

The Roman Catholic Church in Ireland are still investigating the incident.

Brady said the priest, the Reverend Martin McVeigh, 'has stated that he had no knowledge of the offending imagery' and is helping an internal church investigation.

The priest said other church officials used the memory stick and he wanted an investigation to be carried out 'so that what happened can be legitimately explained.'

'I don't know how it happened but I know what happened,' McVeigh said.

Parents are demanding that the priest is suspended from parish duties until an investigation has been completed.

They withdrew their children, mostly aged 9, from a planned Sunday service focused on the children's upcoming first Confessions and Communions.

The church has arranged for another priest to oversee the children's Confessions this month. It is unclear whether the priest will oversee their First Communions in May.
