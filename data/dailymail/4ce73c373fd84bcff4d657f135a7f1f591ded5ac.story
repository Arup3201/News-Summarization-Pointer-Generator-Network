Ivan Rakitic was the star man as Seville beat Benfica on penalties to win the Europa League in Turin on Wednesday night.

The Croatian midfielder produced a man-of-the-match performance and then sealed it with a kiss as he exchanged peck on the cheek with former Reading defender Daniel Carrico.

Rakitic is regarded as one of the best attacking midfielders in Europe, which has seen him linked with a potential summer move.

But when 
asked if he was going to leave at the end of the season he replied: '15 
people have asked me this question already. Just let me enjoy my special
 day.'

Rakitic
 was left exhausted after a physically demanding 120 minutes which ended
 goalless, before the Spaniard sealed victory in the penalty shootout 
thanks to the heroics of goalkeeper Beto.

The 26-year-old said: '‘I am dead. Physically, mentally and emotionally ...we worked so hard and Beto is amazing.'

Rakitic is looking forward to returning back to Seville on Thursday with a European trophy to show off to the locals.

He said: 'Those who know our city and those who know our fans know that tomorrow [Thursday] is going to be an amazing day.'

Rakitic
 will have a further chance to impress this summer at the World Cup, 
with Croatia in Group A alongside Brazil, Mexico and Cameroon.
