A victim in the Rotherham abuse scandal claimed today that she told a police and crime commissioner about her grooming ordeal at the hands of an Asian sex gang face-to-face.

Shaun Wright, who was the town council's cabinet member for children’s services between 2005 and 2010, has been facing calls to resign as South Yorkshire Police and Crime Commissioner.

Now, the victim - who alleges Mr Wright knew for years that local girls were being abused by men - has come forward to protest at his claimed ignorance in the past at the scale of the problem.

Speaking of his reaction to being told in person more than eight years ago about the abuse scandal, the unnamed woman told The Times: ‘He seemed genuinely shocked.

‘He talked like he was going to go away and see something was done, but we never saw him again. It was the end of it for him, but not for us. I sat 2ft from him and told him really, really private things.

‘I don’t know how he can go on national television and say he wasn’t aware, that he didn’t know anything about it. For years they had all the reports and information, but they just ignored it.’

Last week, Mr Wright defiantly repeated his refusal to quit and insisted he will complete his term of office - but announced that he will not seek re-election to the £85,000-a-year post in 2016.

The 46-year-old apologised for his role in the ‘systematic failure’ which allowed the scandal to go undetected for so long, adding: ‘I wish I knew then what I do now.’

Mr Wright will face questions from MPs tomorrow about his knowledge of the abuse scandal.

He
 will appear before the Commons Home Affairs Select Committee, which 
will in addition hear evidence from South Yorkshire Police’s chief 
constable David Crompton.

It
 will also hear from senior Rotherham Council official Joyce Thacker and
 NSPCC chief executive Sir Peter Wanless, who is leading a review into 
the Home Office’s handling of abuse allegations.

Committee
 chairman Keith Vaz said: ‘The revelations from the independent inquiry 
into child sexual exploitation in Rotherham are deeply troubling.

‘The
 committee will be questioning those in positions of authority at the 
time that these offences were being committed on how the sexual 
exploitation of children on a horrifying scale was allowed to go 
unchallenged for so long.

‘We
 will also be hearing from Sir Peter Wanless and Richard Whittam QC 
about progress in their ongoing review of how the Home Office handled 
historical allegations of child abuse.’

It was also claimed last week that Mr Wright has received death threats after being embroiled in the damning report published last month and refusing to resign.

South Yorkshire Police confirmed it had reviewed the safety of several people since the report's publication - but refused to say whether protection has been stepped up around Mr Wright.

The report by independent expert Professor Alexis Jay released last month found at least 1,400 children were abused in the town from 1997 to 2013, largely by men of Pakistani origin.

Mr Wright believes it would be a waste of money for him to resign now, triggering a by-election.

But he has faced calls to step down from Prime Minister David Cameron, Home Secretary Theresa May and the Labour Party. Sheffield City Council passed a vote of no confidence in him last week.

However the police commissioner said he had ‘always acted in the best interests of young people’.
