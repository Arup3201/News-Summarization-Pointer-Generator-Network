Leon Means has been charged with killing four women, including his wife and her mother in 1989

A former convict has been charged with killing four women - two this week and his wife and her mother after a prison escape in 1989.

Leon Means, 61, confessed to the killings to Police Detective Steve White, a Muskegon Heights police officer.

According to Detective White, Means admitted killing 63-year-old Anna Lawson and Judy Bushman, 62, whose bodies were found on Tuesday just blocks apart in Muskegon Heights, Michigan.  

Means also said he had killed his estranged wife, Cynthia Means, and her mother, Linda Herrera, after fleeing from a prison in 1989. 

He was initially charged with both murders, but the case was dismissed.

Detective White said under oath in front of Muskegon County judge, Raymond Kostrzewa, that Means admitted to the killings in a police interview.

Means told detectives that, while at Bushman's home - where he had previously lived - 'he and Miss Bushman exchanged words, and after the argument, he admitted that he killed her,' according to Detective White.

He went on to confess killing 63-year-old Anna Lawson.

Detective White said: 'He admitted he had been allowed in to the residence by Anna Lawson, and while he was there with Miss Lawson there was a confrontation between he and Anna Lawson, and during the confrontation he stabbed her.'

Detectives also asked Means about the June 1989 murders of Means' estranged wife and her mother, White said.

White said Means admitted killing both women. They were found dead on June 15, 1989, in their home in Muskegon.

'He provided detailed statements as to what occurred in that incident,' White said.

People in support of the victims watch Means on video - Dean Herrera said he was relieved Means had finally been charged and that he had 'waited 25 years' 

Dean Herrera said he was relieved Means had finally been charged.

He told WZZM: 'I've waited 25 years. He killed my mum and sister. He stabbed my mum over 15 times and shot her once and stabbed my sister over 30 times.  

'It's sad it had to be like this, at the expense of two other women's lives. But in a way, I'm happy. I suffered a lot of years and waited.'

Police arrested Means on Wednesday and he is currently being held in prison. 

Means has convictions for prison escape, assault, breaking and entering and robbery, according to the Michigan Corrections Department website.

He had most recently been released from prison in July 2012.
