Buried neck deep in filthy, ash covered debris, Filipino children sift through the charred debris from an enormous fire that razed a shanty town in Malabon City.

With just weeks to go to Christmas, hundreds of people lost everything when their homes were destroyed by the wind whipped blaze. Many were made with light materials that were unable to stand the intense heat from the blaze. 

Arson investigators estimate that it caused at least £20 million worth of damage, with much of the debris washing into rivers and the sea around the slum, according to the Philippine Star newspaper.

But astonishingly, fire officials told the paper that only six people were injured by the wind whipped blaze as it raced through the informal settler community which has built up in the city around 10 miles north of the country's capital, Manila.

Much of the debris was washed into the sea and rivers around the settlement. Malabon city has a population of more than 350,000 and is around 10 miles north of the Philippine's capital Manila

Amazingly, only five people were injured by the fire which razed hundreds of homes. Arson investigators think it caused at least £20 million worth of damage  

Wading through the rubbish on the hunt for anything salvageable, children look for metal and other valuable goods amid the wreckage. Filipino authorities think up to 1,000 people were affected by the fire   

Knee deep in sludge children continue to look for valuable. The cause of the fire is unknown, but local media reported that investigators were checking claims that an illegal electrical connection may have been the cause of the fire

The cause of the blaze is unknown investigators were checking claims that an illegal electrical connection may have been the cause of the fire, Chief Inspector Rodrigo Navalta Reyes, told the Manila Bulletin newspaper. 

'A short circuit may have developed at the second floor of a home,' he said, adding that the investigation was ongoing. It is unknown how many people lived in the Shanty town, but when record were last taken in 2010, Malabon City had a population of almost 350,000. 

With Christmas on the horizon, the affected families have asked the government for help, the paper reported.

It has placed added strain on the country's rescue services who were already struggling to cope with the fallout from the destruction wreaked by Typhoon Hagupit which destroyed nearly 16,500 houses and damaged more than 33,100 on the island of Samar.

Rescue teams were struggling to reach upland communities on the eastern island which were thought to have been battered by gale force winds and rain from the storm, which struck almost a year after the country was devastated by Typhoon Haiyan.

Hagupit has since been downgraded to a tropical storm and on Wednesday was headed for southern Vietnam.
