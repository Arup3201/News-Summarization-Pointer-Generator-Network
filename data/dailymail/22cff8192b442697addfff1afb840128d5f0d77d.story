Lewis Hamilton is cock of the walk here in the Royal Park. Asked why Nico Rosberg wants to beat him so fervently, he swallowed his modesty and said with a smile: ‘It’s because I’m good looking, man. I’ve got the car. I’ve got the girlfriend. What can I say?’

So we can safely assert that the rivalry between the two title contenders has not abated. While some of us wish our British hero would act with a touch more humility, it is probably hypocritical of us to decry him entirely for his boastfulness.

For the sniping, moaning and crashing are precisely the reasons why so many eyes will be glued to the action when the lights go out at 1pm BST on Sunday. We await to see whether the two Mercedes men will come together. Will either give an inch to the other?

Life in the fast lane: Lewis Hamilton, in the Mercedes garage on Friday, could consider a move back to McLaren

Catch-up: Hamilton, in action during Friday practice, is 29 points adrift of Nico Rosberg in the drivers' standings

Hamilton does not sound as if he will. ‘I guess I just keep on doing what I am doing,’ he said. ‘I feel it’s important for me not to change. They have hired me to win the championship. They have hired me to get them as many points as possible and to bring the car home, and I have generally been doing that every race.’

The mood of the two men is markedly different. Rosberg seems cowed by the public humiliation of being fined by his team and saying sorry like a stuck record for crashing into Hamilton at Spa a fortnight ago.

In Germany he has been working on transforming his image from ‘Britney’ — as in Spears — into a fully grown man. He was winning fans as a result. But, according to observers in his homeland, his seemingly timid acceptance of Mercedes’ harsh censure has spoiled all that.

Eyes on the prize: Rosberg is now the favourite for this year's title after extending his lead over Hamilton 

Spa break: The two drivers came together in Belgium, Rosberg admitted the crash was his error 

I am not convinced that verdict on his personality is accurate. Yes, it is Rosberg’s style not to engage in public slanging matches, but he has a hard core. His approach now is to close his ears to controversy and focus totally on the only important task: winning the title.

Hamilton is different. He needs to feel the love of the team. Since Spa he has received it in spades, hence his jaunty air. One colleague from his McLaren days noted that Hamilton’s truculence and status as undeniably the biggest star in the sport causes his bosses to court his favour.

It may sound like an odd phenomenon that grown men with big bank balances need the same affirmation as young drivers, but many of them do. Martin Whitmarsh, Hamilton’s old McLaren boss, could hardly see a driver without planting his palms all over his back.

Drivers' standings: Rosberg is currently leading the championship, while team-mate Hamilton is second

1 Nico Rosberg (Ger) Mercedes 220 pts

2 Lewis Hamilton (GB) Mercedes 191 pts

3 Daniel Ricciardo (Aus) Red Bull 156 pts

4 Fernando Alonso (Spa) Ferrari 121 pts

5 Valtteri Bottas (Fin) Williams 110 pts

6 Sebastian Vettel (Ger) Red Bull 98 pts

7 Nico Hulkenberg (Ger) Force India 70 pts

8 Jenson Button (GB) McLaren 68 pts  

Hamilton’s moodiness makes him harder to woo. So they try harder. That is probably why Whitmarsh did not discipline Hamilton when he posted his then team-mate Jenson Button’s telemetry on Twitter in 2012.

It may explain why Mercedes did not act when he revealed what Rosberg said in a private meeting after the Spa crash.

Rosberg, more serene and balanced, is lower maintenance and does not need the same level of indulgence.

The question of which driver is favoured by Mercedes is not a simple one. The team are somewhat divided.

The Mercedes board began the team with the avowed intent of running a German national team. That is why their first driver line-up was Michael Schumacher and Rosberg.

That did not deliver success, so Niki Lauda was drafted in to carry out a review. He signed Hamilton to much fanfare, telling the board that this man could win the title for them. Lauda remains a Hamilton devotee; many at Stuttgart, the Mercedes headquarters, hold on to the notion of a German super-team, so Rosberg is their man.

Then there is the team at Brackley, Northamptonshire. They are virtually all British, so we can assume that most of them favour their compatriot.

The growing feeling in Monza is that if Hamilton loses the title to Rosberg he will leave. His contract talks are on hold and are only due to resume once the season is over. If Hamilton fails to win the title, the Mercedes board will have no need for him. A German winner in a German car would obviate the need for Hamilton.

Escape route: Hamilton could return to McLaren, the team he started his grand prix career with 

McLaren are ready to offer him an escape route. They and Honda, their engine partners of next season, want a marquee signing to end a period of decline at the team. Button, who is 34 and thought by the McLaren hierarchy to be small fractions short of fast enough, could well make way.

But Hamilton is still fighting to win the title. If he does, he will almost certainly stay at Mercedes and have the advantage of driving a quick car again.

His preparations for tomorrow’s race, where he will try to claw back some of his 29-point deficit to Rosberg, were hindered yesterday when he missed an hour of the second practice session with an electrical problem.

He was fastest in the morning, Rosberg fastest in the afternoon. ‘I’ll try to understand what Nico learned in his session and I’ll try to learn that through data,’ said Hamilton of his missed mileage.

‘The team generally works together. When one car moves forward so does the team. It’s always difficult but I’m quite relaxed about it because it’s not the first time I’ve been in this situation, so I feel I’m able to deal with it.’
