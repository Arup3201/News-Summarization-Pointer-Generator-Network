A British doctor who appeared on Sunrise late last year has sparked a debate online with the co-hosts, accusing the program of reducing her to 'an instrument of rank media opportunism'.

Dr Qanta Ahmed, a Muslim woman who appeared on the weekend edition of the show in November penned a post on The Spectator claiming the breakfast program misrepresented her while she was discussing Project Rozana - a humanitarian effort training doctors treating children at Israel's Hadassah hospital.

'In my ignorance, I had unwittingly collaborated in my own exploitation by the Australian broadcaster.

'(They) chose to cast me not as an anti-Islamist Muslim physician, volunteering in pursuit of coexistence, but as a vapid tool serving the malignant media construct of a two-dimensional anti-Semitic caricature of Zionism,' Dr Ahmed wrote in her strongly-worded piece.

Weekend Sunrise hosts Andrew O'Keefe and Monique Wright have posted a response to her claims with a letter titled: 'Right to reply - Dear Qanta Ahmed: What ambush? Where?'

The duo explained that they were partially behind the decision to invite her to speak as they had in fact long been admirers of her work. 

The presenters insisted that they had remained sympathetic to her plight throughout the interview and insist Channel Seven's breakfast show has a long history of promoting reasoned discussion.

The journalists feel that the inference that they were pushing an agenda, with a plan to debase Dr Ahmed, is 'insulting in the extreme.'

Mr O'Keefe and Ms Wright explained that in the wake of Dr Ahmed's accusations, they are feeling saddened, shocked and offended, particularly as Dr Ahmed had told them she was pleased with the interview on the day.

Dr Ahmed has penned an opinion piece claiming the breakfast program misrepresented her when they rolled footage of injured Palestinian children and images that depict Israel as 'a terrorist state'

In her opinion piece, Dr Ahmed explains that she believed it had been a positive experience until she later watched the segment, at which point she felt physically ill, shocked by what she felt was exploitation.

Dr Ahmed alleges that Sunrise chose to broadcast footage of what she calls 'Israel as a terrorist state' which 'detonated her truthful and universal message'.

She took issue with the overlay that was used during the program, which she describes as showing injured Palestinian children, 'decimated North Gaza during the Israel-Hamas war' and the Security Wall from the Palestinian side - not the Israeli side.

Dr Ahmed is outraged, accusing Weekend Sunrise of misrepresenting her, writing that they 'prostituted my goodwill in the service of personal or official anti-Israeli and pro-Hamas propaganda.'

The Sunrise team argue that they gave Dr Ahmed's cause, Project Rozana, positive exposure and sympathetic treatment.

'Your objection to the segment appears largely to be centred around the overlay footage of the Gaza conflict which accompanied some of your responses.'

The hosts of the program insist that they wanted to interview Dr Ahmed as they admire her work, they did not come with any agenda and wanted to give exposure to Dr Ahmed's work and her perspective

The pair proceed to analyse the footage that accompanied their interview. 

'Some of the footage we used showed children in Palestinian hospitals without referencing the conflict at all,' they wrote.

'Admittedly, we did use some footage that was inappropriate to what you were discussing at the exact moment it was played.'

However, they maintain that the footage was a fitting illustration of the points Dr Ahmed had just made while discussing the physical and psychological toll of the war on children.  

Mr O'Keefe and Ms Wright admit that the timing of images on screen was sometimes at odds with the discussion, but insist it is an easy and common occurrence in breakfast television, with no malicious intent. 

'As a “veteran media commentator” you must know that, from time to time, especially when the hosts veer off script to follow a particular train of thought of the guest, the wrong vision goes up at the wrong time. For that, I apologise. Sometimes these things happen on morning television. 

Ms Wright and Mr O'Keefe say they were very sad and surprised when they first heard about Dr Ahed's accusations. They find the 'baseless and libelous' comments 'insulting to the extreme'

Both parties ended their letters with angry, impassioned addresses to the other.

'I felt intensely angry,' wrote Dr Ahmed.

'To be whored out as I strive as an ambassador for a philanthropic mission with universal reach, to be debased as an instrument despite my decades long authority as a physician and Muslim humanist is nothing but obscene.' 

The Sunrise presenters, after presenting a calm and rational argument, also expressed anger.

'Taken as a whole, we cannot see how any reasonable person could argue that we exploited you in any way. 

'To suggest that we came with any agenda, either designed to promote Hamas or to debase you, is insulting in the extreme.'

After apologising for their 'minor mistake', Mr O'Keefe and Ms Wright called for Dr Ahmed to apologise for her defamatory and 'baseless' remarks.

The stunned Weekend Sunrise presenters concluded civilly by congratulating Dr Ahmed for her work with Project Rozana and wished her well.
