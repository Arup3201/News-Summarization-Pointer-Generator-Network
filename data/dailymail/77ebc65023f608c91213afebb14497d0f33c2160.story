Ed Miliband has defended the controversial comedian Russell Brand – insisting that his attacks on democracy are striking a chord with ordinary voters.

The Labour leader said he did not agree with Mr Brand's call for people not to vote, but said he was only saying what 'a number of people are thinking'.

He said the Hollywood star's message – calling for a revolution against Westminster – reflected the fact that ordinary people felt 'politics doesn't speak to them'.

Mr Miliband's intervention comes despite widespread criticism of Mr Brand's call for young voters to turn their backs on elections.

The comic has revealed that he never votes because he regards politicians as untrustworthy and irrelevant.

He told the BBC: 'I'm angry, because for me it's real. This is what I come from... there is going to be a revolution.

'Don't bother voting. Stop voting stop pretending, wake up, be in reality now. Why vote? We know it's not going to make any difference.'

The comedian said he, like most people, regarded politicians as 'frauds and liars' adding: 'The current political system as nothing more than a bureaucratic means for furthering the augmentation and advantages of economic elites.'

Speaking to Shortlist magazine, the Labour leader insisted he wanted people to vote – even if it was for the Tories.

He said: 'I definitely want people to vote – and I want people to vote Labour, obviously – but it's really important that we engage people in the election.'

But he added: 'People criticise Russell Brand, and I don't agree with his message, but what he's saying, a number of people are thinking. Which is that politics doesn't feel like it speaks to them.'

Mr Miliband insisted he, personally, did not feel disillusioned with politics.

He said: 'I'm not disillusioned. I feel incredibly optimistic that we can make a difference to the country.

'And this election really matters. If you think about this election, there's a disagreement about where we are now, because the government thinks it's going pretty well.

'I don't agree. There's disagreement about the future – they've got this plan to go back to the 1930s on public spending.'

Mr Miliband's remarks are in stark contrast to David Cameron, who insisted he was glad Mr Brand would not vote and ridiculed his anti-democratic stance.

The Prime Minister said: 'I'm a democrat. If Russell Brand's got a better idea, he can let us know.'

He added: 'I'm relieved he won't be troubling the scorers in my constituency.'

It also comes after the Green Party distanced themselves from Mr Brand – insisting they did not want his celebrity endorsement.

There had been mounting speculation that the comedian-turned-anarchist – who has worked with leaders of the Left-wing environmental party in recent years – would be unveiled as the 'Green Nigel Farage'.

But senior party sources claimed they didn't need an answer to the charismatic Ukip leader.

One said that if such an offer were to be made to Mr Brand, it should be declined because his 'controversial' reputation would be 'toxic' to some potential voters.

'It might seem like a good idea for two or three days but I suspect it would quickly turn into a nightmare,' the source added.

Last year Green leader Natalie Bennett joined Mr Brand to address 1,200 people at an anti-austerity rally in London.

He has also worked with Green MP Caroline Lucas, to get the Commons to debate drug policy.

But Ms Bennett said last month that the party did not need 'big personalities' to be a success at the ballot box.

She insisted it wanted to concentrate on serious issues and not be led by a person who 'tosses their hair around and waves a pint'.

But Caroline Lucas, the Green MP for Brighton Pavilion, praised Mr Brand.

She said: 'I've worked closely with Russell to promote a more evidence-based, effective and humane approach to drugs policy and appreciate all he has done to put the issue on the political agenda.

'He has effectively rattled the cage of Parliament and it is right that he has - MPs need to do far more to regain people's trust and confidence.'

A party spokesman added that it and Mr Brand 'both believe there is a positive alternative to austerity economics and recognise that the politics of the future does not have to look like the politics of the past'.
