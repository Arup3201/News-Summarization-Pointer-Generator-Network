A man tried to punch his own brother during a drunken fight at a house party - only to miss and accidentally kill one of his best friends who was trying to separate them.

William Lynch, 41, took a swing at his brother, Andrew, but instead hit 62-year old Derek Szostok, who had stepped in when the siblings' 'childish row' turned violent.

Mr Szostok, who lived in the flat below Lynch, suffered a fractured neck and skull when the force of the punch knocked him on to the stairwell. He died four days later.

He underwent a 10-hour operation but suffered a fatal stroke and his life support machine was turned off four days later.

Lynch, from Wigan, Greater Manchester was yesterday jailed for four years and three months after being convicted of manslaughter following a trial at Liverpool Crown Court.

Police said Lynch, locally known as Billy, had lived in a flat above Mr Szostok and the two were close friends. Lynch said he regarded Mr Szostok as a 'father-type figure' and that they often socialised.

Witnesses said Lynch and his brother Andrew got into a drunken argument at the house party last August.   

It escalated when Lynch  threw a coffee table and put his foot through a TV screen, demanding that guests leave. 

Mr Szostok stood up to separate the two brothers but was pushed to the ground by Lynch during the scuffle, which spilled out into the corridor outside.

After Mr Szostok hit his head, Lynch phoned emergency services and told the operator: 'I have hit my neighbour hard, he's paralysed. I didn't mean it.'

Mr Szostok initially responded to treatment but his condition deteriorated and he died on 30 August 2014. A post-mortem examination later established he had died as a result of 'flexation of the neck'.

Defending Lynch, Richard English said his client had vowed never to drink again. 

He said of Lynch and the victim: 'They were truly great friends and beyond that. 

'They regarded each other almost as akin to father and son, and when in hospital Mr Szostock spoke of "his son" and loved him in that role.

Jailed: Lynch, from Wigan, Greater Manchester was sentenced to four years and three months in prison

'While nothing can come close to the loss of a brother and member of your family the loss Mr Lynch bears is very great. 

'He has not only lost a loved friend but he bears the burden of having been the cause of that and that is a very heavy burden for anyone to have. 

'It has scarred him and he will bear that scar for the rest of his life.'

Sentencing, Judge Mark Brown described Mr Szostok as a 'kind soul' and told Lynch: 'You swung a blow at your brother but struck Mr Szostok instead. 

'I accept you did not intend to hit him and there was no animosity directed towards him. Your actions were reckless.'

After the case, Detective Chief Inspector Howard Millington of Greater Manchester Police said: 'This is an extremely sad case, the facts of which paint a tragic picture of excessive alcohol consumption.

'Lynch looked up to Derek as a sort of father-figure, and the two were close, which make's Derek death even more tragic.

'It is clear that Derek was trying to play peacemaker between two brothers whose argument had turned violent. 

'He was therefore an innocent victim caught up in a row not of his own making, and sadly in trying to diffuse the row he has been pushed to the ground and suffered a fatal injury.

'It is a very sad case and I would like to extend my condolences to all of Derek's family for the loss they have suffered. I can only hope today gives them some sense of closure following his death.

'What this case does show is that a combination of alcohol and violence can be a lethal mix.'

In a statement, Mr Szostok's sister, Marie, said: 'Derek was a beautiful person inside and out. 

'He had his flaws, as do we all, but he was a kind soul, often described as a good lad and always there for his family. 

'He was kind, loving, loyal and the life and soul of every family party. We will miss him forever.'
