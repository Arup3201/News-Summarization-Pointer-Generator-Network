A mother has been charged with rape and sodomy after she allegedly engaged in intercourse and oral sex with her son's 12-year-old friend.

Nicole Marie Smith, 30, of St Charles County, Missouri, has been jailed after she targeted the 12-year-old boy at her home, police said. 

The boy reportedly told investigators that he and his friend's mother had sex and oral sex at her suburban home while her own son was in the basement.

According to STL Today, the mom had encouraged the young boy to delete text messages from her and told him she was afraid of going to prison. 

Smith does not have a prior criminal record, according to public records. She is not believed to be married. 

According to KPLR, the victim and the accused had told authorities that they were 'in love'. 

In a statement to Daily Mail Online, St Charles County Prosecutor, Tim Lohmar, said: 'The defendant is innocent until proven guilty. There's no such thing as consensual sex with a child. 

'These allegations are no less predatory than any other allegations of child sex crimes.'

The sexual abuse had allegedly been going on since April 2014 and authorities believe that the 12-year-old is the only victim.  

Daily Mail Online was awaiting comment from the St Charles Circuit Court. The mother is being held on $75,000 cash-only bond. 

Online court records don’t list an attorney on the woman’s behalf.
