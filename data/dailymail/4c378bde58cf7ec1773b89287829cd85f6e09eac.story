A 71-year-old woman who left home to get help for her injured husband has been found dead.

Patricia and Stewart Little from Irasburg, Vermont, returned from a shopping trip on Monday at 5:30pm when Stewart fell getting out of the car and was unable to stand.

His wife left their Creek Road driveway on foot in near freezing temperatures  to get assistance and three days later a police K-9 dog located her body in a field nearby. 

Scene of the incident: Patricia Little left her Creek Road driveway on foot in near freezing temperatures on Monday to get assistance for her husband who fell getting out of the car 

Authorities were only alerted to the incident that day, after a family member dropped in on the Littles. 

Stewart had apparently managed to crawl into his home but couldn't reach the phone to call 911.

He remained there, hoping for his wife to return. 

The relative said he was suffering from an undisclosed medical condition.

After troopers and a canine unit arrived, Patricia was found in a patch of land between her home and the neighbors' shortly after 6pm on Wednesday.

Police said there's no sign of foul play and a cause of death is pending.

'We suspect, obviously with the weather, that she may have fallen and was unable to get up, and she succumbed to the weather,' State Police Capt. J.P. Sinclair told WCAX-TV.

'It's obviously tragic - very, very sad. We certainly wish it could've ended differently,' he added.

Stewart was taken to a hospital and is expected to recover.
