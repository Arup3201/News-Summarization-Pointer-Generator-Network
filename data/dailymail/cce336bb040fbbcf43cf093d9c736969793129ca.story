Thanks to three school-aged children and a messy husband, suddenly my life seems to have become all about laundry.

Our au pair recently left, so, for the first time, I’m having to tackle the mounds of dirty clothes by myself.

But, despite my best efforts, everything looks grubby and stained.

All about laundry: With three children and a messy husband, Alice is left to tackle mounds of dirty clothes

No wonder new research carried out by Samsung has revealed that British families damage more than £100 million worth of clothes every year by washing them incorrectly.

So what to do? I turned to the internet and found countless women swapping imaginative, and sometimes bizarre, laundry tips.

I decided to compile a selection and put them to the test. Laundry guru Steve Anderton, who runs his own professional washing firm, gave his verdicts on which ones work and which ideas just don’t wash. 

Just the tonic? Vodka has some benefit in removing stains

THE CLAIM: You can freshen up clothes by spraying them with vodka. The theory is the alcohol works in much the same way as sanitising hand gels and kills odour-causing bacteria.

DOES IT WORK? As the children’s sports day approaches, I realise most of my summer dresses smell musty thanks to them hiding in the wardrobe all winter.

I choose one I’m not too fond of — just in case this experiment goes horribly wrong — hunt down a water pistol and spray the dress from top to bottom with neat vodka.

Initially, it reeks of booze, though I suppose it masks the musty smell. I hang it over a door and return an hour later.

It smells much fresher — but this may be in part because it has been hanging outside the wardrobe. I would be wary of doing this on delicate material.

STEVE’S VERDICT: Vodka has some benefit in removing stains because it penetrates grease very slightly, but it may affect colour on delicate fabrics such as silk. You’re better off using something like Febreze, which chemically neutralises the odour and is proven to work.

THE CLAIM: Pour white vinegar into the washer drawer and run through your empty machine on a hot wash to get rid of bacteria and limescale.

DOES IT WORK? I am a bit wary about this. I pour about half a cup of white wine vinegar into the washer drawer, which is black with mould, and then run the machine for an hour at 60 degrees. The door is much cleaner-looking and the machine has lost its slightly fusty smell.

STEVE’S VERDICT: White wine vinegar is a good cleaning agent and will have a positive effect on bacteria and limescale build-up. Run the machine empty on the hottest wash once a month, with or without the vinegar, to help keep it clean and fresh.

Cleaning the cleaner:  It's vitally important to keep your tumble dryer clean

THE CLAIM: Vacuuming the inside of your tumble dryer will get rid of lint — little bits of fibre that are released from the fabric as it dries and end up as grey fluff. Lint bungs up your tumble dryer and will leave fluff on your clothes.

DOES IT WORK? When I look into our tumble dryer I am appalled at the build up of lint around the door. I have a nifty little hand-held Dyson vacuum which I use to remove as much as possible and then wipe away the remainder with a clean dry cloth. There was so much, I could have knitted a fluffy grey jumper with it.

STEVE’S VERDICT: This is vitally important. Too much lint blocks the tumble dryer, reduces air flow and, therefore, reduces efficiency. Less air means that garments take longer to dry and so become worn-looking more rapidly.

Remove the lint with your hand after every cycle, and give your tumble dryer a really good vacuum once a month.

THE CLAIM: Use instant coffee to dye faded jeans black again. The natural dyes in the coffee will make them look as good as new.

Some purists make dye from coffee grounds and use buckets to soak it in; others recommend chucking a cup of coffee into the washing machine, though they don’t specify whether it ought to be straight into the drum or powder drawer.

DOES IT WORK? My favourite jeans ever are by Guess and were bought circa 1999. While they’re still going strong, you would never know they had once been black.

I put them into the machine and throw a cup of very strong instant coffee into the drum.

Amazingly, they emerge looking at least five shades darker. And, no, they don’t smell like I’ve spilt my Starbucks down them.

STEVE’S VERDICT: This really does work, as coffee contains tannin which will dye the fabric. But I think you’d need buckets of coffee to get a really good result. You might be better off drinking it and investing in a specific clothes dye.

Fluffy bedding: Tennis balls in your tumble dryer help to transfer heat to the middle of duvets and pillow cases

THE CLAIM: Washing duvets and pillows can leave the filling flat, but popping them in your tumble dryer with a couple of tennis balls apparently rejuvenates them.

DOES IT WORK? Having never actually washed a duvet, I am first forced to do so in order that I can draw a comparison. So I am able to confirm that, yes, adding the tennis balls do make a great deal of difference. My duvet is gorgeously thick and soft when it comes out.

STEVE’S VERDICT: This is fantastic.

Usually the shell of the duvet dries, but not the inside. The tennis balls in your tumble dryer help transfer heat into the middle of the duvet and, together with the tumbling action, results in fluffy bedding.

THE CLAIM: You don’t have to dry-clean silk. Instead, hand-wash it using ordinary powder, dry till damp, then pop it in the freezer to kill germs and loosen grease. When it’s frozen, just iron it, then hang it up again.

DOES IT WORK? My beautiful cream silk Burberry scarf acquired a green stain at a party five years ago and I have been too idle to take it to the dry cleaners. I carefully wash it in my normal Fairy non-bio, lie it flat to dry, then pop it into the freezer on top of a family-size box of fish fingers.

Not so n-ice: Your freezer is never going to be as good as a dry cleaner

When I remove it two hours later, the scarf is stiff with ice and cracks ominously. Nervously, I gently iron it on the  silk setting.

But not only is the stain still there, the scarf actually looks less clean than it did before — placing it on the coloured cardboard of the fish finger box perhaps wasn’t the best idea, as it’s transferred some ink on to the material —  and the expensive sheen is completely gone.

STEVE’S VERDICT: Sorry, but your freezer is never going to be as good as your dry-cleaner. The surface of silk may look powdery if you wash it too aggressively because the surface fibre breaks up very slightly.

Silk is also not colour-fast. This means that the dye  isn’t very well chemically bonded to the fibre and may come out.

THE CLAIM: Adding two tablespoons of table salt to the drawer of the washing machine will brighten colours as salt chemically reacts with detergent and makes it more powerful. It will also ‘exfoliate’ stains away.

DOES IT WORK? I pop in some Saxa table salt along with a couple of my five-year-old daughter’s once luridly neon dresses, which are now a grubby off-yellow. After a 40c wash they look slightly brighter, but not eye-wateringly so.

STEVE’S VERDICT: This will have some effect as table salt does react with detergent. However, two tablespoons won’t make much difference — you could try four. Certain delicate fabrics such as silk and wool will be destroyed by this, but it’s worth a go on cotton.   

Milk magic: Milk only slightly fades Biro stains

THE CLAIM: Milk gets Biro off clothes, possibly because of the lactic acid  it contains.

DOES IT WORK?
 My nine-year-old has just been given a ‘pen licence’ at school. In 
theory, this means that he is able to write neatly; in practice, 
everything is stained with Biro.

It is almost the end of the school year, so I am not paying much attention to how pristine the children’s uniform looks.

Nonetheless,
 I take a white vest that is stained with blue ink and soak it in some 
semi-skimmed West Country milk. An hour later I rinse it. The Biro 
smudge fades slightly but doesn’t disappear.

STEVE’S VERDICT:
 Biro is one of the hardest things to get out. Specialist stain remover 
is probably going to be more effective than relying on the small amount 
of lactic acid in milk.

THE CLAIM: Soak greying whites in hot water into which you’ve dissolved five aspirin tablets.

DOES IT WORK? My five-year-old’s new white socks are completely grey within a week. I dissolve five Anadin into a bowl and leave the socks for two hours. The water is filthy but the socks remain determinedly grey.

STEVE’S VERDICT: Aspirin contains salicylic acid, which might act like a bleach. However, this is such a negligible amount that nothing is likely to happen. Five hundred pills might have some effect!

For whites, I’d recommend using detergents with optical brightening agents. These reflect UV light as white light so that clothes look lighter. Whitening products also contain colour-safe bleaching agents.
