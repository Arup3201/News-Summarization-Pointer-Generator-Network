Branson, aged five, died a few hours after being bitten by a venomous spider

A five-year-old boy has died, hours after being bitten by a poisonous spider.  

Branson Riley Carlisle, from Albertsville in Alabama, died in a hospital a few hours after he was bitten by the brown recluse spider on Sunday, reported TV Station WHNT.

Branson's pastor, Jeff Stanford, told the station his family is devastated by the sudden and tragic death.  

Mr Stanford added the family hires an exterminator to come to the house once a month but the spider - which has a venomous bite - came inside the home due to the recent bout of cold weather.

His funeral was held yesterday at Memory Hill Cemetery

Claudette DeMuth, director of marketing at Marshall Medical Center, said Branson's family brought the spider to the hospital where it was inspected and identified.

'It had the classic markings' of a brown recluse, she told AL.com.

'He was a very sick young man. 

'It is a rare, rare situation for someone to die of a spider bite in our country.'

Last month, a 10-year-old Montana boy died two weeks after being bitten on the leg by the same type of spider

Keith Pierce was taken to hospital on September 30 after his leg started swelling up.  

Also known as the fiddleback spider, the brown recluse spider has a venomous and potentially fatal bite

After ruling out cancer, doctors sent him home, but he taken back to hospital when his pain and symptoms worsened.

He underwent emergency surgery, but never woke up.

Also last month, a Missouri family was forced out of their home after 6,000 brown recluse spiders moved in.

Fumigators had to pump poisonous gas into the house in the upscale neighborhood of Weldon Spring in an attempt to kill the venomous spiders, which had been there for at least seven years.

The brown recluse spider is known as the most deadly spider in America and has spread across the country from Nebraska through Iowa, Illinois and Indiana to Ohio.

The population has been growing rapidly in recent years and the boom is being blamed on climate change by experts. 

Also known as the fiddleback spider, the violin spider or  the brown fiddler, the brown recluse spider has venomous and potentially fatal bite.

They are usually brown or gray in colour and between six to 20 millimeters in length. They typically have markings on the dorsal side of their cephalothorax,

These markings include a black line coming from the dorsel side that looks like a violin, resulting in the nickname 'fiddleback'.

The spiders often build their webs in dry, generally undisturbed locations, including sheds, closets, garages, cellars and other similar places.

In America, their range lies roughly south of a line from southeastern Nebraska through to southern Iowa, Illinois and Indiana, to southwestern Ohio.

In the southern states, they are native from central Texas to western Georgia and north to Kentucky. 

Brown recluse spiders have the ability to survive starvation and thirst, and the way in which they benefit from the regulated room temperatures of human habitations, make extermination of this species particularly challenging.
