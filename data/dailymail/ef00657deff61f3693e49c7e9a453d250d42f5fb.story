Kaka jumps for joy after scoring Orlando City's first ever goal in Major League Soccer against New York City

EXCLUSIVE INTERVIEW: Oscar and Ozil tell me I should come to the Premier League but I'm so happy in Orlando

KAKA'S DREAM TEAM: Cristiano Ronaldo, Andrea Pirlo and Cafu all make Kaka's dream team... but 'genius' Ronaldinho beats Lionel Messi to final spot

5) Orlando City 1-1 New York City, MLS match at the Orlando Citrus Bowl Stadium, March 2015 

This was not the most beautiful goal, it was a heavily deflected free kick, but it is special for me because it was Orlando City’s first ever goal. When I signed for the newly-formed MLS side I really wanted to score their first goal. We were losing by a goal, in their MLS debut game, and the match was in stoppage time, but I hit a 25-yard free kick to the goalkeepers’s right a it took a huge deflection and went into the left of goal. The stadium was full of 63,000 fans practically all from Orlando. The reaction was incredible.

4) AC Milan 3-1 Fenerbahce, Champions League group stage at the San Siro, September 2005 

The game was poised at 1-1 and there were only four minutes remaining of the match. I received the ball from Massimo Ambrosini 10 yards inside their half on the left as we broke from our own penalty area. I just kept running with the ball past one player, then another, then one more on the edge of the Fenerbahce box before finishing low under Volkan Demirel.

3) Brazil 4-1 Argentina, Confederations Cup final at the Waldstadion, June 2005 

Cicinho switched the ball from the right side of the pitch to Robinho on the left. He controlled it with his chest and passed to me on the edge of the box. I took one touch to tame the ball then curled a shot into the top right corner. To do it in a Confederations Cup final was special.

2) Brazil 3-0 Argentina, friendly at The Emirates Stadium, September 2006 

It was late in the game and the ball came out from an Argentina corner. I managed to steal the ball from Lionel Messi and started running at full speed with the ball. He chased me all the way, but I kept ahead of him, ran past Gabriel Milito then finished low past Roberto Abbondanzieri. Pablo Zabaleta couldn’t stop it going over the line, however hard he tried.

1) Manchester United 3-2 AC Milan, Champions League semi-final at Old Trafford, April 2007 

As I said in my interview, my second goal in the Champions League semi-final first leg against Manchester United was a highlight of my career. When the ball dropped from Dida’s long pass all I was thinking about was trying to do something special. To do it at Old Trafford, with all the history of the stadium, was amazing.
