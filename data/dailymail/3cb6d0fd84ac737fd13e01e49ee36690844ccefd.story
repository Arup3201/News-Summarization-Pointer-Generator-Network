A fifth of mothers who gave birth in 2013 were older than their child's father, a new study revealed today.

The Office for National Statistics examined the age gap of parents in the most recent year available.

It shows how the gap is wider among unmarried couples, lesbian couples and those where at least one partner was born outside the UK.Â 

In 2013, one in five mothers was older than the father of their child, the Office for National Statistics found

Almost 12 per cent of couples who had a baby were the same age, but in 7 per cent of births the father was more than 10 years older

There were almost 700,00 births in 2013. In 19.9 per cent of births the mother was older than the father. In 7 per cent of cases, the man was was more than 10 years older.

By contrast, 0.48 per cent, around 3,100 births, the mother was more 10 years older than the father.

Amongs married couples the gap was four years on average, compared to 4.2 years among parents who had not tied the knot.

However, the average gap of 4.2 years was the same among parents who lived together and those who lived apart.

For babies whose parents were both born in the UK, the gap was just 3.7 years, rising to 4.6 years where one parent was born abroad.

The average age gap of lesvian couples was 4.8 years, higher than 4.1 years for other parents.

It is the first time the ONS has examined the age gaps of the nation's parents.

Oliver Dormon, senior research officer at the ONS, said: 'We can see that men are older than women and the gap tens to be fairly small.

'But there is a huge chunk, of 7 per cent, where the father is more than 10 years older.'

He said wider age gaps, especially among non-UK born parents, could be the result of cultural differences.

'There are definitely some cultures in which a younger bride is desirable and where a bride the same age or even older is not what you want at all.'
