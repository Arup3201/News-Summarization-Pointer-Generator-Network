Lock up your bird feeders and guard your bird tables: Squirrels are raiding Britain’s gardens - and they’re ravenous.

Faced with a shortage of nuts and seeds in the wild, grey squirrels are piling into gardens and pinching food left out for birds.

With numbers up a third on recent years and expected to grow as the winter bites, the British Trust for Ornithology has produced a list of tips for bird lovers concerned that there will be enough food to go around.

Helping hand: Animal lovers fear competition for food will be fierce this winter

Advice ranges from coating food with chilli powder, which is disliked by squirrels but palatable to birds, to greasing poles that bird feeders are hung on.

The influx of squirrels has been blamed on the topsy-turvy weather reducing yields of nuts and seeds in the wild.

Plus, in some trees, such as the beech, nut production follows a cycle and this year marks a natural low point.

Short of nuts and seeds to eat now and to squirrel away for the winter, the animals are trying their luck on already-busy bird tables and nut-filled feeders.

Tim Harrison, of the BTO, said: ‘Expect some fireworks at garden feeders this autumn and winter.

Bird lovers recommend covering bird food in chilli powder, because squirrels do not like the taste of it

‘Large numbers of birds are already gathering, with species such as the chaffinch and starling being joined by their continental cousins.

‘With more grey squirrels than normal also on the scene, competition may be intense.

‘Unlike many other small mammals, grey squirrels do not hibernate and so they will be looking for food throughout the winter.’

Dr Harrison has a range of tips for bird lovers who want to keep squirrels at bay.

For instance, feeders can be covered with guards which only allow small birds access.

It may also be possible to keep squirrels away from bird tables by creating a separate feeding area for them, complete with tempting treats.

More unusual solutions including using something like Vaseline to grease the poles that squirrels shimmy up to reach nut and seed-filled feeders.

For this to work, the feeders must of course, also be out of jumping distance.

Another option is to coat bird food in chilli powder. While it is distasteful to squirrels, birds find it perfectly palatable.

Dr Harrison said: ‘It is thought that squirrel’s taste receptors are like our own and so they feel the heat of the chilli and are put off by that.

‘But birds just behave perfectly normally.’

He added that like cats, public opinion is divided on the benefits of having squirrels visit gardens.

‘People have quite strong feelings. They are one of these creatures that some people love having come into the garden and other people don’t like quite so much.

‘Where people want to attract them, they can do that and hopefully still provide for the birds.
