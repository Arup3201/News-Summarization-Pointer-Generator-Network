They were supposed to be getting a good view of the sea during a walk along the Newquay coastline.

But three intrepid tourists got into difficulty when they failed to remember the tide was coming in.

The trio were left stranded and desperately calling for help as the water started to come in around the rock they were standing on.

Three walkers had to be rescued by a lifeboat crew after they became stuck on a rock as they walked along the beach near Newquay and had lost track of time and were unaware the tide was coming in, trapping them

A lifeboat crew rescued them just minutes before the rock became completely submerged because of the incoming tide.

The lifeboat was dispatched to rescue the walkers after attempts to pluck them from the rock using a harness had to be abandoned because parts of the cliff started to give way.

'The timing was perfect, within minutes of them being rescued the area they were standing was completely underwater,' said Chris Charlton, who witnessed the dramatic rescue. 

'Once they got into the lifeboat it was so rough the boat nearly tipped over with them all inside.

'It's a popular walking spot but unfortunately people don't think about the times of the tides and they get caught.

'It is really not that far from where those poor surfers drowned a few weeks ago, people need to be aware of how dangerous the sea can be.

Rescuers had to abandon efforts to save the trio using a harness because rock and shale started to crumble 

The trio were left surrounded by sea as the tide started to come in at Whipsiderry beach and Watergate Bay

'Thankfully these three people were all rescued safely, but they were within minutes of it being a totally different kettle of fish.'

The two men and a woman had become trapped on a rock as they walked along Whipsiderry beach and Watergate Bay near Newquay. 

It is thought they became stranded after losing track of time and the incoming tide.

Witnesses said the lifeboat looked like it would tip over several times as the crew tried to rescue the walkers 

The three people were taken to safety by the lifeboat crew who battled the incoming tides to rescue them 

The Coastguard was called out at about 3pm last Sunday after it received reports of the stranded trio. 

When attempts to rescue them from above failed as rocks and shale started to give way, the RNLI was called. 

Two rigid-inflatable boats (RIB) were sent to the scene to try and remove the walkers by sea.

The three had reportedly lost track of time and were unaware of the tides while out exploring the coast

Earlier attempts to rescue the three walkers had to be abandoned after shale and rock started to crumble

The Newquay inshore lifeboat and the Newquay and Padstow Coastguard crew attended.

A spokesman from the UK Coastguard said: 'When going on the beach or the coast we ask people to please make sure they check the tide times and have an exit strategy.'

Whipsiderry beach is just three miles from Mawgan Porth, where three surfers died as they tried to rescue teens caught in a rip tide last month.
