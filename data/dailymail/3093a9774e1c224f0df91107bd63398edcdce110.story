Another world record toppled to Britain today when a seaside town scooped the official Guinness title for building the most sandcastles on a beach in an hour.

Ireland was the loser as its feat last year of constructing 571 castles was crushed by the North Yorkshire resort of Scarborough which turned out 683.

An estimated 400 people turned up at the seaside town's South Bay to begin the attempt at 11am. There was cheering when it was announced shortly after noon that they had dug their way into the record books.

Over 1,000 sandcastles, measuring 2ft high and 2ft wide, with a turret on top, had to be constructed within one hour for the Guinness World Record to be broken

Awarding the certificate to organisers from Yorkshire Water, Guinness World Record Adjudicator Anne-Leise Rouse said 'This is amazing.

'It is a really great achievement to break the world record by more than 100.

'People think it's easy but it isn't. But we had perfect weather conditions - not too windy and moist sand.'

The rules state each sand castle had to be 2ft tall with a 2ft wide base and include four turrets which did not crumble.

Ms Rouse added: 'It is really difficult. But if it had been sunnier it might have been windier and we would have had more damage castles.'

The original record was set in France in 2007 at 520 castles. Guinness say the current holder was Ireland - set as the Duncannon Sand sculpting Festival in Duncannon.

But that crumbled yesterday as the Yorkshire families worked like demons, many producing more than one castle.

When the order came to stop digging the castle stood in rows 11 deep, covering an area of the sands 125m long and 30m deep.

One of the last castles was built by 11-year-old Matthew Moore and his 65-year-old granddad Horace Price, both from Wakefield.

Mr Price, a retired highways engineer, said: "I am all in favour of anything which gets kids out the house and gets some fresh air into their lungs and some exercise.

'Kids spend too much time sitting at home these days watching TV and playing computer games.'Grandmother Radine Price, 60, added: "It shows children still like to be children.'

Matthew said: "We got here just before the deadline and built ours in five minutes flat.

'All my friends like to go abroad for holidays to places like France but I like the British seaside.'

The world record event was organised
 by Yorkshire Water Campaigns Adviser Aimee Laycock to mark the launch 
of A Coast to Boast About, a partnership between the water company, 
local authorities and agencies to create some of the best beaches in 
Europe in Yorkshire in which the company has invested £110m.

She
 said: 'You only have to see the amount of families who came today to 
realise that sand castle building is as popular as it ever was.

'The rate they were building them was fantastic. We weren't sure we were going to beat the record or not.

'We just wanted people to come to the
 beach, enjoy the sea, enjoy the coast, and try to break records on the 
sand. But now we really do have something to boast about.'

Forty 'sand artists' from around the world at the Sand Sculpture 
Festival on the beach of Blankenberge in Belgium used more than 10,000 tonnes of 
sand to create an amazing 'sand village' as part of the world's biggest sand sculpture festival.

The
 festival, held in June, had a fairytale theme 
and includes majestic castles and enchanting palaces as well as a host 
of comic book favourites.

A
 spokesman said: 'This year the Sand Sculpture Festival in Blankenberge 
will bring to life fairytales by the Brothers Grimm and Walt Disney, as 
well as the magical stories of Charles Dickens and  J.K. Rowling and so 
many other famous tales from the world of myths and legends.

'Not
 only will all the best-known and best-loved fairy tales be on show, but
 also great legends and fables from the four corners of the earth, which
 will allow you to relive that magical days of yesteryear."

Visitors
 can take walk-through tours of the sand village where other comic book 
favourites such as Tintin and the Smurfs are also on display.
