Work out: The routine was inspired by Beyoncé's Grammys performance, with Seen On Screen's own sassy additions

Intrigued, FEMAIL headed to the Dominion 
Theatre in London to learn a super-sexy routine to Drunk In Love, 
inspired by Queen Bey at the Grammys.

Arriving at the Theatre our group was greeted by two sassy and very accomplished dance teachers in a giant studio.

They are top industry professionals who work with pop stars including Beyoncé, Rihanna, Iggy Azalea, Kylie, Lady Gaga on tour and in their music videos.

We worked up a sweat hanging off chairs, sticking out our bottoms and learning the carefully choreographed two-minute number.

The
 Seen On Screen Fitness (SOSF) instructors taught us their version of 
Beyoncé's Grammy performance of Drunk In Love in the two-hour class, 
promising a 600 calorie burn.

Custom
 designed spot lighting, smoke and wind machines maximised our diva 
potential and created the perfect atmosphere for dancing sexily with 
confidence - something that can make some of us feel a bit silly at 
times.

Founder Bonnie Parsons said: 'For the
 Drunk in Love super class we wanted to make it extra special and do 
something different, inspired by Beyoncé's chair routine at the Grammys.

'We wanted to keep 
her sense of sophisticated sexuality with that gangsta swag when 
choreographing our own version for the workshop... queue upside down on a
 chair!

'The routine 
is most importantly about making our students feel HOT in the best sense
 of the word and using a mix of feminine, diva style moves with a hip 
hop edge.

'SOS is 
different to a regular dance class as we really explain and break down 
everything we do because we know you as the student can do it!

'Sometimes,
 it's the simple, little details that make all the difference, for 
example how to lean into your hip to give you the best line, how to whip
 your hair, arch your back at the right moment, how to hold your centre 
correctly.

'All these thing go towards making your performance truly Sasha Fierce and a truly great workshop!'

Designed
 with the young urban professional in mind, SOSF classes are all about 
learning great moves and toning muscles to give you a killer body - 
without feeling like you are working out.

The
 SOSF timetable includes dances such as Rihanna's Rude Boy, and many 
more by Britney and Beyoncé - there are even Twerk master classes - all 
held across four London studios.

Bonnie's company now creates fun and exciting dance classes to help women feel confident in themselves and find a form of exercise they love.

After
 seeing a 500 per cent uplift in sales in 2013, Seen On Screen Fitness 
has since opened up in three new locations and are 
planning their second nationwide tour.
