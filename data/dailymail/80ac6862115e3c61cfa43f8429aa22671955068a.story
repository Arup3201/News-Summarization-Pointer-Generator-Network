Tessa Jowell's hopes of ousting Boris Johnson as London Mayor were hit last night after a shocking foul-mouthed outburst by the former Cabinet Minister.

In an extraordinary interview, the MP – who was made a dame last year and is known for her ‘mumsy image’ – used the word ‘f***’ four times in addition to ‘s***’, ‘a******e’ and ‘penis’.

Her comments came in an interview with the Labour-supporting Guardian intended to promote her campaign to become Labour’s candidate in the 2016 London poll.

But it backfired badly as The Guardian attacked her, calling her a ‘broken model’ and accusing her of faking emotion when she burst into tears.

Dame Tessa’s tirade came as she was asked about her split from her husband, lawyer David Mills, who was prosecuted in Italy for allegedly accepting a bribe from Silvio Berlusconi when Jowell was a Minister.

She always said she knew nothing about it and the couple separated, prompting claims they had done so to protect her career.

They have since got back together and she was subsequently honoured for her work on the London Olympics.

Dame Tessa, 66, who is to stand down as MP for Dulwich in South London for the mayoral challenge, attacked the way she was treated by the press, saying: ‘Those a******es are so f****** rancid that I just hope every morning they wake up and think, ‘‘I’m ashamed of the job I do.’’

'To say that somehow I got up one morning and thought, ‘‘You know what I’m going to do today, I think I’m going to separate from my husband?’’ F*** off.

‘There was a toerag who slept in his little white van outside my house for six days... and for five days I was intimidated. And then I was coming out to go to the gym at eight o’clock on a Saturday morning, and there he was with his f******, you know, penis-like lens, waving out of the window. I banged on the roof of his minivan and I said, ‘‘You f*** off out of here in ten minutes or I’m calling the police.”’

In a cruel put-down, interviewer Decca Aitkenhead says: ‘When she tells me she wants to discuss the “broken model of politics”, she knows what she is talking about.

'But I confess the broken model I keep seeing in my head when we meet isn’t the one Jowell is worried about.’

Ms Aitkenhead continues: ‘Within minutes she is telling me about the woman who made the fabulous dress she is wearing. Her manner is both animated and amazingly intimate and, as she talks about the issues that have meant most to her, her eyes well up so many times that I lose count.

‘Essentially, she is describing everything you would want a politician to be – idealistic, dedicated, emotionally engaged. And yet I can’t stop thinking about The Thick Of It, or picturing the BBC satire’s spin doctor, Malcolm Tucker, telling Jowell what to say.

‘So when a chat about her dressmaker segues into a wider conversation about ethics, it sounds suspiciously like code for “I’m not dodgy.” ’

Dame Tessa and Mills now spend weekends at their country house in the Cotswolds, where he lives, and during the week he visits Jowell at her North London home. 

‘But nothing will ever be the same,’ the MP said. ‘Of course all that s*** still affects us all.’

But she insists fear of further press scrutiny will not stop her trying to oust Mr Johnson. ‘I will not be cowed by what people in the press who don’t like my politics decide to do to me.’

One of Mr Johnson’s allies said last night: ‘If poor old Tess can’t stand the heat, she should get away from the Aga. Boris has been on the rough end of far worse from the feral beasts of the Fourth Estate over his private life – and has never whinged, let alone sworn like a trooper.’

Dame Tessa was unavailable for comment.
