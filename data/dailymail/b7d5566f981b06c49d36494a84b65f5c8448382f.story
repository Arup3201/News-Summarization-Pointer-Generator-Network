Fantasist: Juliet Clarke told a string of bizarre lies to fleece her boyfriends out of thousands of pounds

A 'female Walter Mitty' who conned boyfriends out thousands of pounds by pretending to be pregnant, dying of cancer and even dead has narrowly avoided prison.

Juliet Clarke, 31, told a string of 
bizarre lies to fleece her partners out of £7,000 then spent the 
money on hair extensions, hotels and holidays.

Unemployed Clarke, from Launceston in Cornwall, first tricked Ricky Yelland into thinking she had terminal cancer and was about to inherit £250,000, Plymouth Crown Court heard.

He gave her access to his bank account but after the couple split up noticed over £2,500 had been spent without his permission.

Mr Yelland asked for the money back but Clarke then sent him a series of texts pretending to be her own father saying she was dead - and even discussing funeral arrangements.

One message said: 'Ricky this is Bob, I suppose you have heard the news now'.

Mr Yelland only discovered Clarke was still alive when he when he looked her up on Facebook and found references to a new boyfriend.

Clarke told her next victim Wayne Teare that she was suffering from ovarian and cervical cancer.

When Mr Teare later tried to break off their relationship, she claimed she was pregnant with twins and even sent him a fake picture from a birthing manual from the New York Times.

Mr Teare’s mother was so convinced she was about to become a grandmother that she went out to buy baby clothes, the court heard.

Judge Paul Darlow told Clarke her lies were 'born from a desire to remain the centre of attention.'

But she walked free from court after he decided to suspend her ten-month jail sentence for two years.

She admitted three offences of fraud by false representation between October and December 2011 at an earlier hearing.

The judge told her: 'You are well-versed in playing on the sympathies of others with false illnesses and false conditions.'

He added: 'Your conduct was deliberately fraudulent, mean spirited, targeted and devious. Whether you and I meet again is up to you... If you commit any offences in the next two years, you and I will meet and you will go to prison.'

The court heard Clarke and Mr Yelland dated for around eight months and moved in together in 2011.

Prosecutor Julia Cox said Clarke won his sympathy by claiming she was being treated for cancer and by saying she was on the verge of inheriting £250,000 from her grandmother.

Miss Cox told the hearing: 'He believed she was being sincere until November 2011 when he obtained some bank statements.'

She added: 'He realised there were numerous charges he had not authorised - bills for hotels, a holiday, mobile phone top-ups.'

Mr Yelland and Clarke had split up by then but he contacted her asking about his missing £2,558.

The texts went on to ask Mr Yelland for his bank details because Clarke had supposedly left him money in her will.

Miss Cox said the pair discussed funeral arrangements but Mr Yelland grew suspicious and found out via Facebook she was very much alive and dating Mr Teare.

Clarke met Mr Teare, a serviceman, over the internet while he was serving in Afghanistan and they began a relationship when he arrived back in the UK.

She borrowed money for a fictional uncle’s funeral and demanded more after they split up in January 2012, claiming she was pregnant with twins.

Clarke sent Mr Teare a picture from the New York Times Pregnancy Guide to show off her supposedly swollen stomach.

When he and his mother became suspicious, Clarke sent them pictures and details about a pair of premature twins - including their names and medical conditions.

Investigations later proved Clarke was never pregnant and had in fact been sterilised.

Paul Rowsell, defending, admitted she was like a 'female Walter Mitty character' but unlike the fictional character she lived out her fantasies at the expense of others.

Clarke also asked for four similar offences to be taken into consideration.

She will remain under probation supervision and will have to complete an education and training course.
