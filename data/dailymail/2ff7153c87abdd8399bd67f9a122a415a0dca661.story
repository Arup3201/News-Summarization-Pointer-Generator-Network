At first glance, Lou Street, a 39-year-old mother of four, from Gravesend, doesn't appear to have a care in the world.

But appearances can be deceptive and the reality is quite different. Although she looks healthy, this summer will be the last Lou and her family will ever enjoy together.

'What's killing me is motor neurone disease and the medication,' she explains. 'I've been told I only have a year to 
go but I don't believe it. We'll see!'

Brave: Lou Street, 39, is dying of motor neurone disease and plans to spend her last months with her family

Lou was diagnosed with motor neurone 
disease, a degenerative condition that attacks the nervous system, on the 23rd December 2010 and told that she had just over two years to live.

Three years on, Lou, who appears on tonight's Channel 4 documentary, My Last Summer, believes she has at least one year left, which she plans to spend with her husband John and her two youngest children, Ria, nine, and Mimi, six.

'I didn't want them to think I was keeping things from them,' reveals Lou, who told her family, including her two older children from a previous relationship, of the diagnosis immediately after finding out.

'I've never done that before so why start now?'

While Mimi appears to be coping with her mother's illness, Ria took it badly and in a heartbreaking scene in My Last Summer, reveals that she wishes she hadn't been told. 

'It was a shock,' says the nine-year-old, who says that she would 'be more happier' if she didn't know anything.'

While Ria struggles to come to terms with the prospect of losing her mother, Lou herself has thrown herself into planning her last weeks and even her funeral.

'I have made a decision,' she reveals. 'If I can't 
swallow, you don't feed me, if I can't breathe, you won't make me breathe - I
 don't want that stuff.

'I don't want to end up paralysed with a feeding tube and a breathing machine. You can go on for a very long time like that.

'When it comes to when I can't physically speak or can't move, I'll be too far gone for me to change anything about it -  I'll be stuck.'

Her funeral plans include a party led by a celebrant who will help her family relive happy memories and deliver her final goodbye from beyond the gravee.

That, however, doesn't make the prospect of leaving her family behind, the two youngest girls in particular, any easier.

'The only thing I'm scared of [about dying] is who's going to find me and how will my children will cope. Mimi and Ria are young. Daddy
 isn't going to plait their hair and give them the motherly chat about 
periods.

Tragic: Of the five to appear in My Last Summer, Lou is one of only two still alive to enjoy summer 2014

'And my fear is, he's going to make the wrong choice,' she says 
stopping mid-sentence, her voice cracking.

'It
 hurts knowing that someone else is going to have to step into my shoes 
to be a mother to my children - and not knowing who they are.

'Because
 you don't know if they're going to do right -- if they're actually 
going to love them right. They need someone. He's a fantastic dad - but 
he's not a mother. I wish I could meet them [potential step-mother] now. I'd like to choose 
them, but John would have a fit!'

Lou, ordinarily so composed, wells up. 'I'm dying...' she adds, her voice wobbling. 'My body's dying, my inside and my heart are dying - when I look at my children and when I can't do things with them.

'You've got to look it and say, "What would be the best thing?" The best thing would be to survive it. But it's not going to happen. It's not. It's just going to get worse and worse.'
