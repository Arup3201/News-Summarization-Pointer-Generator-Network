Jonjo Highton, 18, described  as 'a good-looking boy who did not deserve this', is believed to have been set upon by a group of men outside his house

Three men have been charged with murder after a teenager was hacked to death by a  mob outside his home.

Jonjo Highton died from neck wounds after he was attacked by a group of knife-wielding men in Preston, Lancashire on Saturday.

The 18-year-old was attacked in similar fashion in June last year in a so-called 'punishment slashing' and needed major surgery to be able to walk again.

Three suspects, Owen Whitesmith, 19, Arron Graham, 22, and Craig Walton, 26, all from Preston, will appear in court today charged over his killing.

Five other men from Preston remain in police custody under arrest for suspicion of murder.

Police are still looking to trace a vehicle that may be connected with the incident.

Det Supt Eddie Thistlethwaite said: 'We are determined to thoroughly investigate the tragic and callous murder of Jonjo Highton.

'We continue to make good progress with this investigation, however we are still keen to trace people who may have been involved in the incident.

'I would encourage anyone with any information at all about the murder to contact the police before we visit you.

'I am continuing to appeal for information about the current whereabouts of a car which may have been involved in the crime, a blue Vauxhall Vectra, registration KG04 EJU.'

Jonjo died after a gang of men turned up at his home in two cars at 11.20pm on Saturday.

His death came a year after he was attacked while riding his bike. In that incident, a group of men pulled up in a car and knocked him to the ground, raining down brutal kicks and punches.

That attack is thought to have stemmed from him becoming somehow caught up in a feud between rival gangs in Preston. 

Last November, Shaun Tyrer, then 33, and Dylan Cornwell, 17, both admitted wounding with intent against Jonjo.

Tyrer was sentenced to eight-and-a-half years and Cornwell to seven-and-a-half years. A third man was cleared.

Floral tributes and hand-written notes lie in the street where the 18-year-old was stabbed to death on Saturday

Jonjo declined to give evidence against his attackers at their trial.

Jonjo's devastated family have been too upset to comment on his death but on Facebook Ashley Miller Hardman posted: 'Rest in paradise Jonjo my brother – gone but never forgotten.

'You will be missed by all of us. See you again one day. Love and miss you. Night and God bless.'

Parts of Preston have suffered a spate of violent gang attacks in recent years with organised crime groups from nearby Manchester and Liverpool blamed for escalating turf wars over drug-dealing.

Only this week, Lancashire Police launched a knife amnesty, revealing that the county had recorded 3,712 offences involving bladed weapons between April 2010 and March this year.

Amid fears of further knife attacks, Det Supt Thistlethwaite said: 'I would say to any young person involved in and around gangs who think it's clever that it's not clever.

'It represents a waste of young people's lives.'

Drew Gale, a local councillor, said: 'Like any city, Preston has its fair share of gangs, but this terrible incident is particularly shocking as it is such a rare event.

'In the past, it has been mainly seen as a matter of unruly kids, but this appalling crime shows the importance of tackling the problem before it escalates into more violence.

'My heart goes out to the victim's family. This brutal attack has horrified the people of Preston.' A neighbour said: 'It's terrible to think that something like this could happen on your doorstep – I'm scared to go outside now.'

Jonjo was set upon in a similar attack last June, when men attacked him with a machete in the street
