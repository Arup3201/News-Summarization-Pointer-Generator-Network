Claimant: Bento Touray claims she was fired from two Michelin-starred Le Gavroche because restaurant bosses did not want diners to be greeted by a black person

A receptionist fired from two Michelin-starred Le Gavroche tried to sue the restaurant for race discrimination after claiming bosses did not want diners to be greeted by a black person.

Bento Touray had only worked at Michel Roux Junior’s exclusive London establishment for three weeks when she was let go in September last year, and replaced by a white woman.

Miss Touray took the Mayfair-based French restaurant to an employment tribunal, claiming that general manager Emmanuel Landré, who was 
on holiday when she was hired, told her to leave and she believed that 
the restaurant did not employ black people front of house.

She claimed that on his return Mr Landré had ignored her, it was 'apparent' he disliked her, and she alleges she was later replaced with a white receptionist.

However, staff at Le Gavroche claimed Spanish Miss Touray had poor language skills, was badly organised and did not provide the exceptional level of service expected at one of the best restaurants in the world.

Her case was later dismissed by the tribunal judge.

'I was dismissed because I am black. I was made to feel like one of the oddest employees there,' Miss Touray told the Central London Employment Tribunal.

'They treated me differently because I am black.

'Le Gavroche does not employ non-white staff front of house. This was confirmed by comments from my white predecessor.'

Miss Touray was hired on August 23 by the restaurant’s assistant manager Ursula Perberschlager, after a day’s trial.

She claims she was given the job permanently and signed a contract; however the restaurant states she was only given a month’s trial.

Her role was to open the door for customers, greet them as they came in, show them their tables, look after the cloakroom and open the door for them on the way out.

She denies she had ever been told her work was not up to standard or challenged on any mistakes.

'There were no complaints about how I fulfilled my role,' she said.

'No other staff at Le Gavroche made any complaint.

'When Mr Landré came back from holiday things changed. It doesn’t make sense to me. He treated me differently, he barely talked to me.

'It was apparent Mr Landré did not like me, he did not speak to me. He would often ignore me and not even say hello.'

She claims the general manager told her on September 11 that would be her last day of work, as she was no longer needed.

She said: 'I asked why and also if I had done anything wrong. Mr Landré said that my work was good but they did not need another receptionist.

'I subsequently learned Mr Landré had recruited a new receptionist, I presumed he had her lined up when he dismissed me. She is of white skin colour.

'As a result of the discrimination I suffered serious injury to my feelings.. My esteem and confidence was undermined and I suffered stress as a result.. I attended counselling.

'I genuinely believe I have been subjected to race discrimination.'

However, Mr Landré vehemently denied his sacking of Miss Touray has anything to do with her race.

He said: 'Since it opened in 1967, Le Gavroche has always employed individuals with many different ethnic identities in both kitchen and front of house.

'The allegation that Le Gavroche does not employ non-white staff is simply not true; in 2013 alone we employed thirteen non-white employees in our front of house team. Five of the individuals in the receptionist role since the start of 2013 have been non-white.

'Miss Touray’s suggestion that 
individuals are employed or treated differently according to their race 
is entirely untrue and without foundation.'

He
 told the hearing that as soon as he returned from holiday in early 
September concerns were raised by Ursula Perberschlager and her sister 
Sylvia about Miss Touray’s work.

He
 said: 'I do not agree that I did not like Miss Touray, my only concern 
was with her behaviour to our clients and whether she was capable of 
performing her role at Le Gavroche.

High Standards: Set up by the Roux brothers Michel and Albert in 1967, Le Gavroche became the first UK restaurant to be awarded three Michelin stars in 1982 before it was taken over by Michel Roux Jnr (left)

'Despite additional training and close supervision I did not observe sufficient improvement in her performance. Miss Touray displayed a lack of organisation in how she performed her duties, often mixing up guest’s property and taking guests to the wrong tables.

'Due to her poor communication skills she was unable to undertake various administrative tasks or conduct telephone calls. I was very concerned by a failure on her part to be sufficiently personable with the guests. This is an extremely serious failure.

'She was the first experience people had of Le Gavroche, and their last, so would be their lasting impression. She affected the feeling people got out of the restaurant, and this would damage the reputation of Le Gavroche.

'Our clients pay a lot of money to come here. As one of only a handful of two Michelin-starred restaurants in the world customers of Le Gavroche have the highest expectations, and we always aim to exceed those expectations.'

The court also heard from Noemi Guy, who had been a receptionist at Le Gavroche before being promoted to Mr Roux and Mr Landré’s PA.

She said: 'I am a Swiss national, born in Haiti and of Black Caribbean descent. I did the same job as the claimant. It was a hard job; you had to be at your best all the time. There were high expectations but I made it though.

'I was never treated differently by Mr Landré or anyone else because of my colour.'

Ursula Perberschager told the court she 
had hired Miss Touray because she had some hospitality experience and 
had suggested from a trial shift she could do the job.

She
 said: 'I explained to her her employment was on a one month trial basis
 and it depended on Mr Landré. Despite comprehensive training, I became 
concerned about Miss Touray's performance.

'She
 was not able to perform tasks such as putting coats on hangers, or 
pulling chairs out and moving tables for customers. We would expect to 
see a genuine eagerness to serve customers in Miss Touray's role, but 
that was not clear in her performance.

Consequences: The tribunal was told that at the restaurant, overseen by Michel Roux Jnr (pictured), 'reputation is of absolute importance'

'We
 expect a receptionist to be there and be present, and give customers 
service before they ask for it. I told her there and then when she was 
making mistakes and told her how to put it right.

'However there was no significant improvement in her performance.'

Both Ms Perberschager and her sister said
 they had challenged Miss Touray on numerous occasions about failures in
 her customer service and were consulted when Mr Landré decided to sack 
her.

However, Miss Touray claims she was never told by either of the sisters her performance was less than exemplary.

Summing up her evidence, Miss Touray told the tribunal: 'I believe Mr Landré is racist and you are protecting him.

'I believe 100 per cent that my dismissal was not due to my performance in any way. Ursula and Silvia have both worked with Mr Landré for 13 years. Will their evidence be objective? I don't think so.

'No one ever gave me any reason why I was dismissed or any opportunity to appeal.

'Before Mr Landré came things were fine, than he came and things started to change. I got on with the sisters before. They did not once challenge me on my performance.

'I noticed as soon as I started there were no other black faces around. There was nothing wrong with my performance. I was sacked because I am black.'

Toby McArdle, representing Le Gavroche, told the hearing that Miss Touray simply did not meet the exceptional standards the restaurant demanded of employees.

First set up by the Roux brothers Michel and Albert in 1967, Le Gavroche became the first UK restaurant to be awarded three Michelin stars in 1982, before it was taken over by Albert's son, Masterchef: The Professionals judge Michel Roux Jnr in 1991. The restaurant lost the third star in 1993.

Mr McArdle said: 'The fact Le Gavroche is a high end fine dining restaurant cannot be underestimated. One slip up on standards in such a prestigious and well known restaurant can result in significant consequences. Reputation is of absolute importance to the restaurant.

'It has not been suggested Miss Touray was a woeful employee but the expectation at Le Gavroche far surpassed that of most run of the mill restaurants.

'That she is unable to accept her performance may have been at fault shows her inability to look at things from an objective position.

'The claimant said she did not see any other black people front of house after two days there. I claim she is overly sensitive to race and colour. She has not elaborated on her allegation that Mr Landré treated her differently because of her colour or shown any actions of his that could be termed racist. I urge the tribunal to dismiss the claim.'

The tribunal's judgement found against Miss Touray.

Following the outcome Mr McArdle said: 'We were delighted, although not surprised, to receive the verdict we have always expected.

'We were justified in taking the stance to defend this baseless allegation by Ms Touray to full hearing, and have been completely vindicated on all counts.

'The Tribunal Judge Professor Alan Neal said that "there is no evidence to support the suggestion that the restaurant has any policy or practice of discrimination in any form".'
