Slumping sales have America's most iconic beer scrambling to catch the attention of the coveted milennial market with quirky ads aimed at the Pabst-swilling set.

Budweiser's holiday advertising won't heavily feature the iconic Clydesdale horses galloping through snow, which have dominated the brand's Christmas spots for years.

The beard- and spectacle-wearing actors have replaced the horses just as the King of Beers' throne is being challenged by craft beers and imports. 

Cheers! Budweiser has changed its target audience with holiday ads that feature 20-somethings enjoying the iconic American beer

Prefer Pabst? The ads come as Budweiser's sales slump thanks to a lack of demand for the beer from the under 30 set

Budweiser research has revealed a whopping 44 percent of drinkers aged 21 to 27 have not even tried one of the red and white labeled American lagers, reports the New York Post.

Those labels, too, are set for a change.

At the start of November, Budweiser began offering an 18-pack that comes in a nostalgic wooden crate with bottles festooned with labels from 1918, 1933 and 1976.

The company says the crates are replicas of those that were used to deliver the beer to retailers after Prohibition. 

Along with the ads featuring young, cheerful people drinking Budweiser, the move appears to be leveled at drinkers who've helped blue collar Pabst become the beer most associated with hipsters.

The change comes as Budweiser's share of the U.S. beer market has declined since hitting its peak in 1988. According to Beer Marketer's Insights, Budweiser had 7.6 percent of the market last year, down from 14.4 percent a decade ago.

The Clydesdales have been associated with Budweiser since 1933, when the company introduced them to celebrate the repeal of Prohibition for beer. 

The country's No. 3 beer brand said the horses will not play a role in its traditional advertising for the season, although the company added later Monday that they will be featured in spots promoting responsible drinking.

Anheuser-Busch InBev also said the Clydesdales will return to be part of its upcoming Super Bowl ads.

'The Clydesdales play a strong role for the brand, representing Budweiser quality and care for more than 80 years. As icons of the brand — and relevant symbols of integrity, perfection and team spirit for all generations — they are important to the brand and our campaigns,' Anheuser-Busch said in a statement last Monday.

Beat it, horses: The Clydesdales have been associated with Budweiser since 1933, when the company introduced them to celebrate the repeal of Prohibition for beer. Their traditional spot in the brand's holiday ads has been taken over by beard and spectacle-wearing millennials 

Anheuser-Busch and MillerCoors, two of the world's biggest beer makers, are posting online what's inside bottles of Budweiser and Miller Lite after pressure from a food blogger.

The two companies on Thursday posted the ingredients of some of their most popular brands, and promised to be more transparent in the future. The announcements come a day after blogger Vani Hari posted a petition on FoodBabe.com to get major brewers to list what's in their beverages.

Anheuser-Busch posted the ingredients for its two top-selling brands on its website, tapintoyourbeer.com. It lists the same ingredients for Budweiser and Bud Light: Water, barley malt, rice, yeast and hops. The company, which also makes Beck's, Busch and Michelob beers, said it will list the ingredients for all of its other brands online "in the coming days." It's the first time Anheuser-Busch has detailed the ingredients of its beers.

MillerCoors posted the ingredients of Miller Lite, Coors Light and six other brands on its Facebook page. Most are made from water, barley malt, corn, yeast and hops, the company said.

"We also value transparency and are happy to comply with the request for additional information," MillerCoors said in a statement. The company says that consumers can call to ask what ingredients are in their beer, and it will also put more information online "in the days ahead." Its other brands in the U.S. include Peroni and Redd's Apple Ale.

Both companies said that they are not required to list ingredients, but are doing so voluntarily because customers want it.

The online petition, started Wednesday by Hari, now has more than 44,000 signatures.

Hari has become a powerful voice in the food industry. She is the same blogger who pushed sandwich chain Subway to remove an ingredient in its bread that's also used in yoga mats. Subway has since removed that ingredient.

She chose to petition beer makers because her husband drinks beer and she wants to be able to see what she is buying.

Representatives from Anheuser-Busch invited Hari and her family to visit its brewery in St. Louis and see how its beers are made. Hari said she is working with the company to figure out a time to visit.

Anheuser-Busch is part of the world's largest brewer, Belgium-based Anheuser-Busch InBev. MillerCoors is a joint venture owned by London-based SABMiller PLC and Denver-based Molson Coors Brewing Co.
