Jailed: Ian Poulton, 33, was sentenced to five years after a sex toy he was carrying in his trousers was mistaken for a handgun by terrified residents in the Hadley area of Telford, Shropshire

A thug who sparked an armed police raid when terrified residents mistook a sex toy for a gun has been jailed for five years.

Ian Poulton, 33, was arrested when 15 officers armed with machine guns swooped on a quiet street in Telford, Shropshire in May this year.

Police were alerted when residents reported seeing a man with a concealed weapon tucked into the waistband of his trousers.

But it turned out the suspected handgun was actually a sex toy.

Poulton, from Wellington, Shropshire, was jailed for five years after he admitted possessing an item which had the appearance of a handgun with intent to cause fear of violence.

He also admitted at Shrewsbury Crown Court to assaulting his neighbour Jose Luis Candelaria, causing him actual bodily harm, on the same day.

Jailing Poulton, Judge Robin Onions said: 'It was clearly not a gun, be it imitation or real.

'It was an entirely innocent object. It was the defendant's intention to deceive.

'Witnesses thought is was a firearm so he has to take the consequences.'

Poulton also pleased guilty to separate charges of causing criminal damage to a police car and laptop and aggravated vehicle taking.

He was also banned from driving for three years and made the subject of three restraining orders.

Rhiannon Jones, prosecuting, said shortly after 2pm on May 22, witnesses thought they had seen a man carrying a gun in the Hall Gardens area of Hadley.

Armed swoop: Poulton was arrested by machine gun-wielding police in the Hall Gardens part of Hadley, Telford on May 22. He assaulted a neighbour on the same day, the court heard

When armed police arrived minutes later, arrested Poulton and seized the weapon, they discovered it was in fact a 'sex aid'.

Speaking at the time of the incident, West Mercia Police said: 'A member of the public reported to us that a man had been seen with a firearm in the Hall Gardens area of Hadley.

'Any reports of firearm incidents are taken seriously and we send resources according to the anticipated threat level.'
