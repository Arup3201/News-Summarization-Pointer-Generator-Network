The parents of drum major Robert Champion were left ‘appalled’
after Florida A&M University concluded that the 26-year-old student was at
fault for his own death in last year’s hazing incident.

In legal papers filed on Monday, the university maintained that it was
Champion, not the school, who bears the ultimate responsibility for his death.
Champion died last November after he was beaten by fellow members of the famed
Marching 100 band aboard a charter bus parked outside an Orlando hotel.

The university asserts that the
26-year-old Champion was a top leader in the band and he should have refused to
take part in the hazing ritual.

Blame game: Florida A&M University concluded that drum major Robert Champion was at fault for his hazing death last year

‘No public university or college has a
legal duty to protect an adult student from the result of their own decision to
participate in a dangerous activity while off-campus and after retiring from
university-sponsored events,’ states the lengthy filing by Richard Mitchell, an
attorney with the GrayRobinson law firm hired by FAMU.

Instead, the university maintains that
Champion — who it says witnessed others being hazed that night on the bus —
consented to the hazing ritual in order to gain respect among fellow band
members.

Because of that, FAMU wants a judge to
throw out the lawsuit filed against the university by Champion's family or at
least delay action on it until criminal charges against Marching 100 band
members are resolved. The family also sued the owner and driver of the charter
bus where the ritual took place.

‘Under these circumstances, Florida's
taxpayers should not be held financially liable to Mr. Champion's estate for
the ultimate result of his own imprudent, avoidable and tragic decision and
death,’ states the motion filed by the university.

However, Champion's parents and their attorney disagree.

Life cut short: Champion, 26, passed away after he was beaten by fellow members of the famed Marching 100 band aboard a bus

‘No, he was on the clock,’ attorney Chris Chestnut told ABC. ‘This is a
school sanctioned event. It's in a bus they chartered, at a hotel they
designated for him to stay at exclusively with members and staff of this institution.’

The legal filing represents the first
formal response that the university has made in the wake of Champion's death,
which led to arrests of band
members, the suspension of the famed band for this football
season and the resignation of the school's president. Twelve former members
have pleaded not guilty to charges of felony hazing.

The suit was brought by Robert and
Pamela Champion of Decatur, Georgia. University trustees had discussed trying
to mediate the lawsuit, but FAMU's response may have doomed that effort.

‘It's startling that they would blame the victim for his own death,’ Chestnut
said. ‘FAMU is pointing the finger at everyone else but themselves, including
their own students.’

The lawyer added that the lawsuit needs to go forward so that the university
is held accountable for tolerating a culture of hazing that went unchecked for
years.

Appalled: Champions' parents, Robert, left, and Pamela, right, as well as their attorney Chris Chestnut, center, said they are determined to pursue their lawsuit against FAMU

‘Someone has got to hold FAMU
accountable,’ Chestnut said Monday. ‘We are now more committed than ever to
litigate this case to clear Robert's name and eradicate the culture of hazing
for the safety of future students.’

The university's motion also notes that Champion signed a Hazing and
Harassment Agreement prior to his death in which he acknowledged the ‘dangers
of participating in hazing, either as a hazer or a hazee.’

Chestnut, however, called the reference to the agreement a ‘tongue-in-cheek’
move on the part of FAMU.  

Ousted: Florida A&M University President James Ammons reached an agreement with school officials to immediately resign from his post

‘Everyone signed that agreement, but they also knew that unless you were
hazed, you weren't accepted,’ he said.

The Champions claim university
officials did not take action to stop hazing even though a school
dean proposed suspending the band because of hazing three days before their son
died. In its response the university denied that any specific proposal or
recommendation was made regarding suspending the band prior to Champion's
death.

The Champion lawsuit also noted that
school officials allowed nonstudents to play in the band and asserts that
school officials fell short in enforcing anti-hazing policies and did not keep
a close eye on band members to prevent hazing.

The university in the last several
months has instituted a long list of new policies, including limiting the
Marching 100 to just FAMU students and putting in new academic policies.
Beginning in spring 2013, students will be required to sign an anti-hazing
pledge before they're allowed to register for classes.

The State University System of Florida
still has a pending probe into whether university officials had ignored past
warnings about problems with hazing at FAMU.

Hundreds of pages of records reviewed
earlier this year by the Associated Press showed years of repeated warnings
about brutal hazing passed without any serious response from the school's
leadership until Champion died.
