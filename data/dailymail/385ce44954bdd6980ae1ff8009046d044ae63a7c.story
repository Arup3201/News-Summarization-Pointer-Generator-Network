A Canadian mother has sparked a backlash against United Airlines after she claimed a flight attendant tried to force her to cover up while she breastfed her five-month-old son.

Kristen Hilderman, from Vancouver, said a male employee tossed a blanket at her husband as the plane taxied to a runway at George Bush Intercontinental Airport in Houston.

Mrs Hilderman said the incident occurred in front of other travellers and left her feeling embarrassed and furious.

The journalist has received plenty of support online after a tweet about her experience last Sunday sparked an angry response from fellow Twitter users.

She said a United Airlines employee who contacted her by telephone yesterday apologised for the ‘frustrating experience’ and promised to follow up within 48 hours.

The Hildermans were flying back to Vancouver after a holiday in Costa Rica and were on the final leg of their journey when the incident occurred.

Mrs Hilderman said she was wearing a breastfeeding tank top when the flight attendant approached and asked her husband, Luc, if they were travelling together.

She wrote in a letter posted on Twitter: ‘My husband replied “Yes” and then the flight attendant tossed a blanket at him (didn’t even hand it TO him, but tossed it AT him) and said tersely, “Then HERE, help her out.”

‘I had a blanket under my baby and a blanket draped across my knees and the plane was hot and stuffy… he wanted me to cover myself.

‘I went beet red and the passengers around us stared with their mouths agape. I whipped around as the flight attendant walked down the aisle behind us and I said, “Help me out with what?”’

Mrs Hilderman said she repeated herself in a louder tone, but the flight attendant continued to walk down the aisle and did not respond.

She said other passengers were stunned, adding: ‘A man a couple of rows back called out, “Because you’re breastfeeding… he wants you to cover up. That is so offensive. I have a seven-month-old baby and if that happened… I would be so offended.”’

Mrs Hilderman said she didn’t want to make a further scene or get into trouble, but didn’t bother to use the blanket. She folded it and put it on the floor, and continued to breastfeed her son, Caleb.

‘I felt so completely embarrassed, uncomfortable and self-conscious for the rest of the flight. A few passengers approached me to let me know that the flight attendant’s behaviour was completely out of line, and that they didn’t even know that I was breastfeeding my baby until he tried to make an example out of me.’

Making matters worse, the flight was diverted to Seattle because of dense fog in Vancouver. When passengers reboarded to continue their journey, the same flight attendants were on board and a folded blanket had been placed on Mrs Hilderman’s seat.

She said: ‘Not a single other seat. Just mine.

‘I am so furious about this entire incident. I’ve been breastfeeding my son [in public] since he was born, and never has anyone made me feel so uncomfortable and ashamed for feeding my baby without pulling a cover over his head.'

A United Airlines spokesman told MailOnline Travel that the Chicago-based carrier has reached out to Mrs Hilderman and will follow up with her to discuss her concerns.

The spokesman said: ‘United welcomes nursing mothers on board and we ask that crew members do their best to ensure their comfort and safety as they do with all customers.
