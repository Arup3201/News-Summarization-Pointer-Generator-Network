She may have been just three and at the helm of a toy boat, but the same wistful gaze to the horizon is plain to see.

As this picture taken in 1953 shows, Princess Anne’s love of sailing began at a young age.

Earlier this week, the Daily Mail revealed the princess is indulging her passion for all things nautical by splashing out £500,000 on a bespoke yacht.

The photo of the young princess was taken in Malta aboard HMS Gambia when the Queen and Prince Philip paid a visit with Anne and Prince Charles.

Bernard Weeks, 78, then a leading seaman in the ship, kept a copy as a souvenir.

He said: ‘We built two wooden boats and the children had a great time pedalling up and down on deck. We also dressed up as pirates and threw a birthday party for Charles.’

Princess Anne and her husband Vice Admiral Sir Tim Laurence are investing in a Rustler 44 yacht.

The princess has yet to reveal the name of the customised vessel, which is believed to have been built to exacting specifications and include twin cabins, a large galley and lounge areas.

Keen sailor: Princess Anne has always loved sailing, competing in various races including the British Steel Challenge in 1992 (pictured). She also won the 1971 European Eventing Championship in her recently sold boat

Her last yacht was called Blue Doublet after the horse that carried her to victory in the 1971 European Eventing Championship.

It seems unlikely, though, that she will name the new vessel after her daughter Zara’s horse High Kingdom, which helped her to a silver medal during the Olympics.

An associate of the princess revealed: ‘It will be called something very Scottish. Anne loves Scotland and wanted a name that celebrated a part of the world that she adores.’ 

Princess Anne and her husband spend most of their holidays cruising around Scotland, where their new yacht will be moored.

The princess is also a keen pharologist – someone who studies lighthouses – and has vowed to see every one in the country.

Her old yacht, a Rustler 36 which was on
the market for more than eight months, was recently sold for a sum 
believed to be not far short of its £95,000 asking price.

The Blue Doublet came with a bill of 
sale signed by the couple and a brass plaque acknowledging that the 
yacht was bought for the Princess Royal. It has a tiny galley kitchen 
and a white plastic toilet.

But it won’t be going far – its new 
owners are believed to be planning to keep it near its old berth in 
Ardfern, Argyll, where Princess Anne will moor her new vessel, as they 
live in the area.

The ‘beautifully cared for and 
professionally maintained’ yacht  failed to attract a single bid in the 
first six months after it went on sale.

At the time, Simon Jones, a director 
of Rustler Yachts, told the Daily Mail that Princess Anne’s teak yacht, 
with blue velour furnishings, was a good investment.

‘It is in spectacular condition,’ he 
said. ‘It has been on the market since the autumn but it was probably 
put on at the wrong time of year. We have had a lot of interest – all 
from the UK – but no offers yet.

‘But I am hopeful it will sell in the
next month or so. For a Rustler 36 of that age it is by far and away 
the best we have had.’ 

Falmouth-based Rustler Yachts, which is also 
building the new yacht, said in the sale advertisement: ‘The 
world-famous R36 “Blue Doublet” owned by HRH The Princess Royal and Vice
Admiral Sir Tim Laurence from new is looking for a new home.

‘The yacht will transfer to her new 
owner with a signed bill of sale from the royal couple. Beautifully 
cared for and professionally maintained, the name “Blue Doublet” will 
pass to her new owner.

‘She is currently ashore at the Rustler factory and has just undergone the usual treatment to show her at her best.’
