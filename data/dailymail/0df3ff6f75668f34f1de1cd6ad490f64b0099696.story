House Democrats have decided to play ball and participate in a special committee charged with investigating the Obama administration's handling of a 2012 terror attack in Benghazi, Libya that left four Americans dead and forced the withdrawal of U.S. diplomats from the eastern port city.

House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi named five Democrats to the panel: Elijah Cummings of Maryland, Adam Smith of Washington, Adam Schiff of California, Linda Sánchez  of California and Tammy Duckworth of Illinois.

Some in the Democratic caucus had floated the idea of boycotting the committee and leaving Republicans to pursue the Benghazi investigation, opening the opportunity to paint the investigation as a partisan political stunt in an election year.

Play ball!: House Minority leader Rep. Nancy Pelosi appointed five Democrats to serve on a GOP-led Select Committee charged with investigating the 2012 Benghazi terror attack

The military-style incursion directed by Islamist terror group Ansar al-Shariah against U.S. diplomatic facilities left the U.S. Ambassador to Libya and three other Americans dead

They initially demanded equal representation on the committee, but the Republican majority stuck with tradition and divided the seats 7 to 5.

Two weeks ago another scenario emerged that would have seen a single Democrat participating so that liberals could keep tabs on its activities without appearing to approve of its mission.

The special Select Committee will gather more than a half-dozen separate committees' investigations into the Benghazi attack under one roof, taking over principally from the Oversight and Ways & Means committees.

Cummings, the senior Democrat on the panel, is also the ranking minority member of the Oversight committee.

He has crossed swords with Republican chairman Darrell Issa, a California firebrand, over the significance of documents, the breadth of subpoenas, and the notable saga of former IRS official Lois Lerner, whose Contempt of Congress vote a group of Issa-led Republicans pushed to the House floor, where it succeeded.

In addition to having broad subpoena powers and license to grill hearing witnesses that would usually fall under a range of committees' separate jurisdictions, members of the new committee will be allowed to interrogate them at length instead of sticking to a traditional five-minute limit per questioner.

House 
Speaker John Boehner has tapped South Carolina Rep. Trey Gowdy to chair 
the committee. He will be joined by fellow Republicans Susan Brooks of 
Indiana, Jim Jordan of Ohio, Mike Pompeo of Kansas, Martha Roby of 
Alabama, Peter Roskam of Illinois and Lynn Westmoreland of Georgia.

The outspoken and sometimes cantankerous Maryland Democratic Rep. Elijah Cummings will counter Gowdy as the ranking member of the House minority on the panel

They are charged with finding out what the U.S. State Department and Pentagon could have done to save lives – yet didn't – and what the White House may have done to cover up an incompetent security system that denied the Benghazi compound extra muscle when al-Qaeda-affiliated militants began threatening to attack.

No one has been arrested or charged with a crime in connection with the September 11, 2012 military incursion at an American diplomatic outpost and a nearby CIA annex, carried out by Ansar al-Shariah, an al-Qaeda affiliate.

During a weekend fundraiser, President Barack Obama called Republicans' focus on Benghazi and his Obamacare insurance overhaul law 'not serious.' He previously referred to Benghazi and other crises in his administration as 'phony scandals.'

The outcome of the Select Committee's work could impact the 2016 election: Hillary Clinton, who was Secretary of State during the attack, is likely to run for president. Her conduct before and after the 2012 calamity is in question.

Initially, she and Obama both shied away from conceding that Islamist terrorists had attacked Americans in Benghazi, instead blaming the massacre on a spontaneous protest in reaction to a crude U.S.-made YouTube video that lampooned the Muslim prophet Muhammad.

The intelligence community, it later emerged, never reported that conclusion on the ground. And the White House knew almost instantly who was lobbing fixed mortars and grenades into the compound.

The ranking Democrat will be Maryland Rep. Elijah Cummings, who has been a thorn in the side of the GOP as the House Oversight Committee investigated Benghazi on its own
