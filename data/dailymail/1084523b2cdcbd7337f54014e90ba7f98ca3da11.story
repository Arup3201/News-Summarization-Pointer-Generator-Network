Paris Saint-Germain midfielder Thiago Motta has a suspected broken nose after being headbutted by Bastia forward Brandao following Laurent Blanc's side's 2-0 win at the Parc des Princes. 

Video footage shows Brandao waiting for the Italian midfielder in the tunnel after the final whistle, smashing his forehead into Motta's face and then running away.

PSG president Nasser Al-Khelaifi told BeIn Sports he thinks the Bastia striker should be 'banned for life' following the altercation. 

Al-Khelaifi said he would be filing a report to the French Football Federation requesting that action be taken against the 34-year-old.

The headbutt happened at the end of an eventful game which also saw Zlatan Ibrahimovic hobble off injured.

PSG picked up their first win of the Ligue 1 season thanks to goals from Lucas and Uruguay international Edinson Cavani.
