When it comes to popping the question - men are becoming ever more inventive.

And none more so than Justin Scheman, who spent six weeks and $2,500 planning a proposal based on the hit TV show The Amazing Race. 

The Phoenix radio producer whisked his girlfriend Diana Bishop away on a 5,000 mile clue-chasing trip - spanning six US states and two countries and ending with him getting down on one knee beneath the Northern Lights in Iceland.

She said yes! At the end of his intricate proposal, which was based on the hit TV show The Amazing Race, Diana Bishop agrees to be his wife

His meticulous plan involved tricking his girlfriend into thinking she was a contestant on an online edition of the Amazing Race - a show the couple has watched religiously since it was first aired.

The multi-Emmy Award-winning reality series pits 11 teams, each comprised of two members, against each other on a trek around the world for approximately 25 days.

The Amazing Race is a multi-Emmy Award-winning reality series hosted by Phil Keoghan, which pits 11 teams, each comprised of two members, against each other on a trek around the world for approximately 25 days. 

At every destination, each team must compete in a series of challenges, some mental and some physical, and only when the tasks are completed will they learn of their next location. 

Teams who are the farthest behind will gradually be eliminated as the contest progresses, with the first team to arrive at the final destination winning $1 million.

Mr Scheman took his fiancée through challenges just as she would if she was a contestant on the popular show - but over just 24 hours.

The plan, which was captured on video, ended with the couple embracing under the Aurora Borealis.

Mr Scheman said that it was not until the couple were on their way to Iceland that he revealed the whole thing was a ruse.

Speaking to the Huffington Post, he said: 'When she realized CBS didn't set up that race she was floored!

'She kept kissing me and squeezing me. It was so cute, I wish the camera was rolling! She couldn't believe I was so detailed. 

'With the pull-tab envelope, the way the clues were written, the arrows posted on the streets, real release forms, etc. I even used the same cars they use on the show.'

Beginning: Mr Scheman tricked his girlfriend into thinking she was a contestant on an online edition of the Amazing Race, which began with him presenting her with these faked instructions

Mr Scheman admitted that planning the proposal was a challenge as he lives in Phoenix while Miss Bishop has been living across the country in Philadelphia

Mr Scheman admitted that planning the proposal was a challenge as he lives in Phoenix while Miss Bishop has been living across the country in Philadelphia. 

He said he hired people from Craigslist to assist with the clues and challenges but did not get to meet the cameraman until the day of the stunt.

While his intricate scheme played out perfectly, the radio producer's actual proposal was beset by nerves as he bent down on the ice.

As he declared his love for Miss Bishop in the last frame of the video he even drops the ring.

Quest for clues: The elaborate plan saw he and his girlfriend travel through six US states completing challenges - in identical style to the popular TV show 

Another challenge: The couple are huge fans of The Amazing Race and have watched all 18 seasons

Getting warmer: Miss Bishop did not learn of her boyfriend's intentions until they were on a plane to Iceland

He told Fox 10 Phoenix: 'Everything I wanted to say, nothing came out right. I just started talking, grabbed the wrong hand, and I just started crying like a baby.  

He added: 'It's not that much effort for somebody you love when you say I would do anything for you, don't say it, do it, go out and do it.

'I may not be the richest man, but I'm going to spend my life making every one of her dreams come true.'

Chilling out: The trip to Iceland involved the couple having a facial while relaxing in hot springs surrounded by snow
