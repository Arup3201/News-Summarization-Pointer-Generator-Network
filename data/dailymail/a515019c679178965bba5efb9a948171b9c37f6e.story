A tree planted in a Los Angeles park in memory of Beatles legend George Harrison has been killed...by beetles.

The pine tree in Griffith Park was planted as a sapling in 2004, three years after Harrison's death at 58.

This weekend it was revealed that the tree has died after ten years due to a bark beetle infestation.

Ironic: Beatles legend George Harrison's Memorial Tree in LA's Griffith Park (left is the memorial plaque and right is the tree before it was cut down) has been killed by beetles

Sad: A stump marks the spot where the legend's tree once stood

Los Angeles Councilman Tom LaBonge said a new tree will be planted soon, according to the LA Times.

LaBonge says several trees at Griffith Park have been killed by the beetles.

The tree grew for ten years near the park's famous observatory and reached a height of 10 feet.

In front of it was a rock and plaque that bears the inscription 'The George Harrison Tree: In memory of a great humanitarian who touched the world as an artist, a musician and a gardener.'

There is also a quote from Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, a spiritual guru to the Beach Boys and Beatles among others:

'For the forest to be green, each tree must be green,' it reads.

The legendary musician was an avid gardener and lived his final years in Los Angeles, where he died in 2001 at the age of 58
