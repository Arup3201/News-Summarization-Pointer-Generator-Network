A Polish prankster whose video of a mutant spider dog got 133million views on YouTube last year has been jailed after another stunt failed to amuse the authorities.

Sylwester Wardega rose to international fame after he dressed his dog Chica up as a terrifying eight-legged arachnid and filmed the reaction has he unleashed her on the unsuspecting public.

But the 27-year-old's most recent prank has landed him behind bars, after he ran around a Polish shopping centre appearing to wear no pants - and seeming to use its bins as toilets.

Joke: Sylwester Wardega dressed as an old man before pretending to use a bin as a toilet in a busy Polish shopping centre in front of a shocked security guard

Arrested: Authorities apparently found the prank less funny - and charged him with indecent exposure

The 2.58 video shows Wardega dressed up as an old man in a shopping centre in the Polish capital Warsaw last March.

It begins innocently enough, with him spinning around on an escalator at the central train station next door to the  centre as a bemused conductor looks on. 

He is then filmed trying to catch carp in a tank in Tesco with a fishing rod.

When a security guard comes over and asks him what he is doing, he pushes him away and tells him to 'sshhh'.

But the prank takes a less salubrious turn in another scene, where Wardega is filmed sitting on a bin near an esculator with his trousers round his ankles.

He then throws a toilet roll at a security guard's head before running off.

The video has had more than 7million views.

Filmed: The entire incident - along with other pranks, like the above - was captured on film

Fame: Wardega has created a following for himself with his elaborate pranks - but it was when he dressed with pet dog as a giant spider that he grabbed international attention

Writing on his Facebook, Wardega announced he had been sentenced to a month in jail.

He wrote: 'I just got convicted for a month imprisonment (sic).

'Because of the film 'Grandpa Prank' and the situation in which I allegedly ran around Zloty Tarasy [the shopping centre] with my pants down while I pretended to have physiological needs.

'Ok, I understand, you do not run around with no pants in public... but I was wearing shorts.'

Terrifying: Chica and Wardega's terrifying, but amusing, prank has now got more than 133million views

A court official confirmed: 'He was sentenced to a month in prison for indecent exposure.'

Stunned fans have now reacted with disbelief.

Online commentator Anna Nowak, 24, said: 'It is ridiculous.

'First, it is clear that this video was a joke. He wasn't exposing himself as he had skin covered pants on.

'And anyway, how do can they prove it was him? He was wearing a grandpa mask.'
