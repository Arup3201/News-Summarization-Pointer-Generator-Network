Tony Blair's involvement in the Middle East peace process came under scrutiny today as a ceasefire between Israel and Gaza collapsed, while the first Israeli death in a week of fighting has been confirmed.

A civilian in his 30s was killed today when he was struck by a mortar from the Gaza Strip while delivering food to soliders at the Erez Crossing.

Nearly 200 Palestinians have been killed in strikes in Gaza since Israel launched the campaign over a week ago to stop rocket fire at its citizens.

Gaza militants have fired more than 1,100 rockets toward Israel in the fighting but mostly thanks to its "Iron Dome" defense system, no Israelis were killed until today.

Police spokesman Micky 
Rosenfeld said at least 15 Israelis, including several children, have 
been injured by the Palestinian rocket fire since the fighting began.

The
 speedy resumption of violence, less than a day after Egypt presented 
its ceasefire plan, illustrated that it will be harder this time than in
 the past to negotiate an end to Israel-Hamas fighting.

A
 key difference to a previous truce in 2012 is that Hamas does not trust
 the current rulers of Egypt who deposed a Hamas-friendly government in 
Cairo a year ago.

Israel had 
agreed to the Egyptian plan, proposed late Monday. Under it, a 12-hour 
period of de-escalation was to begin at mid-morning Tuesday. Once both 
sides agree to halt hostilities, they would negotiate the terms of a 
longer-term truce.

Gaza
 militants responded by firing dozens of rockets after the proposed 
start of the de-escalation, some of them reaching deep into Israel, 
though not causing injuries.

Israel, which had warned it would strike 
Gaza harder than before if Hamas did not halt hostilities, held its fire
 for several hours, but resumed air strikes by mid-afternoon Tuesday. 

After
 the renewed rocket fire from Gaza on Tuesday, Israeli Prime Minister 
Benjamin Netanyahu and Defence Minister Moshe Yaalon 'directed the 
military to act with intensity against terror targets in Gaza,' said an 
Israeli official.

Mr
 Blair's apparent involvement as Middle East Envoy apparently exacerbated
 the situation.

Diplomatic sources told the Guardian that Mr Blair has 
been a key voice in the past week, but Palestinians do not trust him as 
he is perceived as pro-Israel, while he also backed the current Cairo 
regime that overthrew the Muslim Brotherhood a year ago.

Earlier My Blair had praised the 'leadership of Egypt' in calling for a ceasefire.

He
 said: 'Such a ceasefire can halt the tragic loss of life, stop the 
rockets on Israel - and open up the possibility of a genuine change in 
Gaza.'

The
 renewed rocket attacks on Israel came after the Palestinian militant 
group swiftly rejected a proposals for a truce agreed by Egypt and 
Israel and warned its attacks will 'increase in ferocity and intensity'.

Sami Abu Zuhri, a senior official with the Palestinian militant group, spoke moments after Israel accepted the offer.

He said: 'This proposal is not acceptable.'

The al-Qassam Brigades, the armed wing of Hamas, added that it had not officially received the text of the agreement but said excerpts the group had seen showed it was 'an initiative of kneeling and submission'.

'Our battle with the enemy continues and will increase in ferocity and intensity,' it said.

The Egyptian plan had called for hostilities to end this morning, followed by negotiations on easing the border blockade of Gaza.

But the Israeli government warned that Israel would strike Gaza even harder if Hamas does not accept the truce. 

A spokesman said: 'If Hamas rejects the Egyptian proposal, if Hamas continues to shoot rockets at Israeli cities, we are prepared to continue our military operation and intensify it as needed to protect our people. 

The territory has been under a blockade by Egypt and Israel since Hamas seized Gaza in 2007.

The Israeli Cabinet accepted the proposal for a ceasefire to end a week of conflict with Hamas militants in the Gaza Strip that has killed 185 Palestinians and exposed millions of Israelis to Hamas rocket fire.

The office of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the Cabinet met this morning and accepted the proposal, which went into effect at 9am local time. 

It called for a ceasefire to begin within 12 hours of 'unconditional acceptance' by the sides, followed by the opening of Gaza's border crossings and talks in Cairo within two days.

Egypt's state news agency said that Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi had met with Mr Blair, envoy for the so-called Quartet of United Nations, European Union, Russia and United States, in efforts to secure a truce.

An Israeli government official said Mr Blair had met with Mr Netanyahu on Friday. Today, he met with Israel's President Shimon Peres at the President's residence in Jerusalem.

Meanwhile, thousands of Palestinians are fleeing northern parts of Gaza after Israel warned it was targeting the area. The UN says so far 17,000 people have sought refuge in its facilities.

Two American TV series filming in Israel have been temporarily derailed by the conflict.

FX's Tyrant, set in a fictional Middle Eastern country but filmed in Tel Aviv, said it has had to fly its cast and crew to Istanbul on Monday morning.

The show is filming the last two episodes of its first season, which began airing late last month.

And the mini-series Dig, which filmed the first of six episodes in Jerusalem, is extending a planned break for two more weeks to wait out the conflict, but might relocate to the U.S. if needed.

The series, starring Jason Isaacs and Anne Heche, is scheduled to premiere this fall.

'We're looking at all options, and hopefully everything will calm down and we can go back to what we planned,' says Gideon Raff, an Israeli producer who co-created both series. 

Israel launched the offensive last Tuesday, saying it was responding to weeks of rocket fire out of the Hamas-ruled territory.

The surge in hostilities over the past week was prompted by the murder last month of three Jewish seminary students in the occupied West Bank and the revenge killing on July 2 of a Palestinian youth in Jerusalem.

Israel said on Monday three Jews in police custody had confessed to killing the Palestinian.

Hamas leaders have said a ceasefire must include an end to Israel's blockade of Gaza and a recommitment to a truce reached in an eight-day war there in 2012.

Hamas also wants Egypt to ease restrictions at its Rafah crossing with Gaza imposed after the military toppled Islamist president Mohamed Mursi last July. 

But the Egyptian proposal made no mention of Rafah or when restrictions might be eased.

It said only that 'crossings shall be opened and the movement of persons and goods through (them) shall be facilitated once the security situation becomes stable on the ground'.

Hamas has faced a cash crisis and Gaza's economic hardship has deepened as a result of Egypt's destruction of cross-border smuggling tunnels.

Cairo accuses Hamas of aiding anti-government Islamist militants in Egypt's Sinai peninsula, an allegation the Palestinian group denies.

Hamas has said it wants the release of hundreds of its activists arrested in the West Bank while Israel searched for the three missing teens.

The detainees include more than 50 Hamas men freed from Israeli jails in a 2011 prisoner exchange.

The proposed truce made no mention of the detainees in stipulating that 'other issues, including security issues, shall be discussed with the sides.'
