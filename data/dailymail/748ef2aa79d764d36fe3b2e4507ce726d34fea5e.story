Filmmaker David Riggs couldn't have chosen a more perfect winter's day to send his quadcopter drone out above Observatory Beach on the southern coast of Western Australia.

It was a crystal-clear day in the town of Esperance, and Riggs was hoping his high-tech rig would catch some sea life at play.

But impeccable timing saw his quadcopter camera capture vision of about 70 bottlenose dolphins surfing in the pristine turquoise waters of Observatory Beach.

The filmmaker captured a pod of around 70 bottlenose dolphins at play in the crystal-clear waters off WA

His camera, attached to a drone-style quadcopter, captured around 37 dolphins patiently waiting for a wave, before turning as one and surfing back toward the shore

He was hoping to film sharks which were thought to be following whales - which usually begin their migration along Western Australia's south coast this month - but got more than he bargained for.

In his 15 years of filming marine life, Riggs has never experienced so many dolphins at one time, he told MailOnline.

'I've never seen them that intense and that playful, either - it was just extraordinary,' he said. 'That's why I posted it because I knew people would get a kick out of this - it was great.'

Riggs, a professional documentary maker, says he was filming largely for the fun of it when he captured the incredible scenes.
