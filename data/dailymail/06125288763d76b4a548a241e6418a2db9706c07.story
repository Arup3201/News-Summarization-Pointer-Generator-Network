Scotland buried the ghost of their first-ever defeat to Tonga two years ago with a hard-earned but comfortable five-try victory in Kilmarnock.

It was far from the most convincing display by the Scots in this historic first Test match at Rugby Park, with penalties and handling errors hindering their first half efforts, but set-piece dominance and a return to simple basics in the second half led to three second half scores that proved too much for the Tongans.

The first half was a frustrating affair, Scotland seeking to ignite the fast-paced, ambitious attack that new head coach Vern Cotter has sought to inculcate in the side. But a penalty count that rose to nine by half-time and a series of passing and catching errors stymied momentum, and also allowed Tonga to show their threat.

The South Sea Islanders had in young stand-off Latiume Fosita, who plays for New Zealand province Northland, an accurate goal-kicker and he punished Scottish failings with four penalties that had Tonga 12-7 ahead by the half-hour mark.

The Scots had responded to going behind to Fosita’s first strike after ten minutes, by scoring the game’s first try. It came from a series of lineout drives which provoked the Tongan forwards into illegal darts into the side.

It earned skipper Nili Latu a yellow card after two infringements and the tourists did not get the message as they infringed twice more before Scotland made them pay on the scoreboard when Blair Cowan, the openside flanker, crashed over the line after a fourth successive drive.

However, though down to 14 men, Tonga responded with two more Fosita penalties as the Scots struggled to hold onto ball and allowed the Tongans to make ground too easily.

Centre Alex Dunbar then incurred the wrath of the officials for a tackle then turned Tonga full-back Vungakoto Lilo on his head. Dunbar received a yellow card and while it was not a terrible tackle Lilo’s feet did fly up above his shoulders, and he required treatment, and so was fair.

With Dunbar missing, the Scottish back line messed up an attack out of their 22 and duly conceded another penalty as Laidlaw tried to recover the situation, handing Tonga a five-point lead heading into the last ten minutes of the half.

However, one thing Scotland have uncovered in the past year is an ability to finish from the sniff of a chance. In the 32nd minute Tonga were pressing the home 22 and looking dangerous when a big tackle forced a loose ball and Stuart Hogg picked it up and took off on an 80-metre run that left the Tongans trailing and hugely deflated, and the full-back celebrating his eighth try in 27 Test matches.

Scotland should have been further ahead at half-time but Visser was caught just short after twice catching chips and Laidlaw squandered another golden chance when a clever lineout trick set the scrum-half racing through a gap 15 metres out, but he dropped the pass. Dunbar was guilty of the same error, failing to grasp another slick lineout coming onto the ball at full pelt, and so the sides disappeared with just two points between them.

The giving-up of an early penalty maintained the all-too-familiar pattern in the second half. But where it changed was in Fosita pulling this one wide of the uprights and the Scots responding swiftly by taking advantage of two penalty awards to move into Tonga’s 22, and from another lineout platform, Dunbar showed superb strength to hold off two tackles and dive into the right-hand corner.

Mistakes continued to puncture Scottish promise, however, with Johnnie Beattie kicking straight out and Russell delaying his pass long enough to squander an overlap, but Scotland maintained the pressure and Laidlaw grasped a penalty chance to extend the lead to a more comfortable ten points 15 minutes in.

Scotland’s lineout and scrum began to dominate the Tongans with and without the ball, despite – or perhaps because of - the Islanders replacing their entire front row.

Laidlaw eased Scotland further ahead with a penalty with 15 minutes remaining, and big-bearded prop Geoff Cross put it more than two converted tries out of Tonga’s reach with terrific strength to batter between two Tongan front rows and crash over.

Laidlaw’s conversion took him to 299 points but he was replaced before reaching the 300-mark by Chris Cusiter and was only able to watch as Russell missed adding the extras to a fifth try by Tommy Seymour.

It was Russell who created the chance with a skilful high ball into the dead-ball area, which bounced back off replacement Duncan Taylor into Seymour’s hands for an easy dot-down to allow Scotland to seal a rare 11-try tally over three autumn games that should maintain the growing self-belief in Cotter’s squad.
