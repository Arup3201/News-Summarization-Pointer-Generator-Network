A woman who lost her university class ring in a lake in Texas is set to be reunited with it more than 60 years on after it went missing.

Elizabeth Clark, who now lives in Washington State, lost her Howard Payne University class ring in 1954 in Lake Nasworthy near San Angelo when she and her future husband went for a picnic and decided to wade into the water.

After the 84-year-old realised her ring was missing after going into the lake, she tried to look for it and even returned to the lake at a later date to find the ring but her attempts proved unsuccessful, reports San Angelo Live.

But after several years of drought, the ring showed up on the lake bed in March and was found by Lindsay Waddell.

A member of the university's alumni association drove to San Angelo to retrieve the ring and was able to identify it from the initial, which read AED - Addie Elizabeth Little, inside the band.

And on Friday at a family reunion, Mrs Clark will be presented with the ring by the lady who found it after more than 60 years.

She said: 'I worked hard for that ring. I'm grateful it was found and that it was in good shape after 60 years.'

Mrs Clark, one of 16 children, was the only to finish college and earned her degree in elementary education.

She taught fifth-grade in California for the Santa Anna Unified School District, where her daughter said she won a teacher of the year award.

The lake as it is now after a drought caused it to dry up. This allowed Lindsay Waddell to find the ring lying on the lake bed

The ring, which is 10-carat gold with a blue stone, has been cleaned up ready to present back to Mrs Clark at her family reunion in her hometown of Brownfield, 40 miles southwest of Lubbock, Texas.

Mrs Clark's daughter, Donna Clark-Love said: 'She cried, she just couldn't believe it. 

'This was like the highlight of her life. She is just thrilled.

'I think she's more excited about getting the ring back than coming to the reunion.' 

And Mrs Clark, who remains in contact with many of her college friends, couldn't wait to tell them the good news.

'She got on the horn and called everybody,' her daughter added.
