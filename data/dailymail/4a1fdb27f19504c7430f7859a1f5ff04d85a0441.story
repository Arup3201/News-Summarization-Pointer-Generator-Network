Reports the couple have employed a professional nanny come as the family prepares for their first official tour

The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge have hired a Spanish supernanny for Prince George, it has been claimed.

Prince William and Kate have chosen a nanny said to be in her mid-thirties who has worked for high-society families for two decades.

The news comes as photos emerged this weekend of the eight-month-old prince with a childminder in Hyde Park, as his parents holiday in the Maldives.

A friend of the unnamed nanny told Hello! magazine: 'She has worked with other prominent high-society families in the past.

'It was from there that the Cambridges heard of her and hired her.

'She is not married and doesn't have a boyfriend as her life is totally dedicated to the family she is working with.

'She is known for being totally professional - married to the job.'

William and Kate have made clear they intend to be hands-on parents.

They have often enlisted the help of Kate's mother Carole Middleton, as well as occassionally employing William's former nanny Jessie Webb.

However, with their upcoming tour of Australia and New Zealand signalling the start of more frequent public engagements, sources claim the royal couple is eager to secure an aide.

The pair faced a barrage of criticism when they flew off on their second honeymoon last week.

The couple have flown to an exclusive resort on the Maldives, leaving their baby with Carole and Michael Middleton – plus his own security detail – at their Berkshire mansion.

But the decision sparked a storm on social networking sites Mumsnet and Twitter.

Critics said they were wrong to leave the young Prince for so long, while others were concerned about the extravagance of their stay only a few weeks after the whole family, including George, went to Mustique.

William and Kate always said they want to be hands-on parents but their list of duties is growing

The couple arrived at Cheval Blanc Randheli on Noonu Atoll, on Thursday for a week-long break. Packages there, including flights, can cost £6,799 a person.

Some people questioned how Prince William, already condemned for boar hunting in Spain last month, was able to take time off from his ten-week agriculture management course at Cambridge University.

However, a number of other commenters said the move may suggest they have already found a nanny to care for him while they are gone.

Clarence House declined to comment.
