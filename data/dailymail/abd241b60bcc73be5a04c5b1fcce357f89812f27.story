Bath will be without the services of Steffon Armitage for their Champions Cup campaign after head coach Mike Ford announced that they had failed to agree financial terms with Top 14 side Toulon.

Armitage sought the move to the Recreation Ground in order to win a place in England's squad for next year's World Cup, but securing release from his three-year contract with the European champions has proved impossible.

The 29-year-old back row has been included in Toulon's 24-man squad for Sunday's Champions Cup clash with the Scarlets and Ford will look elsewhere for back row injury cover.

'It's a dead deal,' Ford told BBC Radio Five Live.

'Like I said earlier in the week, we tried our best to get him but we just failed to cross the line and couldn't agree the finances with Toulon.

'Steffon plays for Toulon this weekend and it's a dead deal.'
