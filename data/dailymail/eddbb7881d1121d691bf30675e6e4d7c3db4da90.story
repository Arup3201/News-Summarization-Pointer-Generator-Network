Hundreds of TV hopefuls queued to audition for a new ‘grittier’ TOWIE-style reality show based in Coventry.

They braved the cold weather and waited outside S7VEN Night Club in the West Midlands city for the chance to be part of the pilot reality show, Sent to Coventry.

Colourful and boisterous personalities were grilled by the panel of judges made up of TOWIE and Geordie Shore agent Chris Bryniarski, Hollyoaks star Holly Matthews and director of the show, Tom Sharman on Friday.

The pilot show is being made by the BBC and Endemol, the production company behind Big Brother and is hoped to emulate the success of BAFTA-winning show The Only Way Is Essex, based in Essex.

Among the candidates seeking fame was Ritu Dhami, also known as Missy D, who runs an online radio station in the city.

The 42-year-old from Walsgrave, Coventry said: ‘I was actually shocked that Coventry was chosen for the show - I’m glad it’s here though, this is my home.

‘If the show is done properly it could 
put Coventry on the map but if they paint a bad picture it will be hard
to Coventry to come back to life again.

‘I’m just what this show needs. I represent British Asians in Coventry. I believe there are not enough Asians on TV being portrayed in the right way.

‘I’m a talent that hasn’t been discovered.’

Jade Samantha, 20, travelled to Coventry from Leicester to cause a stir when she flashed her chest to the crowd outside the club and shouted: ‘Pick me!’

Looking for fame: Among the crowd auditioning was Monarch the dog (left), put forward by owner Joanna Robinson, and ex-Big Brother housemate Rebecca Shiner (right)

She was ushered into the building by bodyguards.

Ms Samantha, who used to work for Babestation TV, said: ‘I’ve got quite a few friends in Coventry and I’d like to get to know the city a bit better. 

‘I want to show everyone what I’m like.

'This was the best way to get noticed. The bodyguards dragged me in pretty fast.’

She walked into her audition topless and sat down ready to be grilled before judge Holly Matthews said: ‘I’m a bit speechless.’

Ms Samantha added: ‘I want to bring some crazy energy and I want to show Coventry people how it’s done.

‘Coventry is quite a sleepy town and I want to liven the place up a bit. I like the city because it’s real - not fake. 

‘I wouldn’t want to be around people who are fake. I’ve recently split up with someone after a year and now I’m free and single.’

One of the more unusual contestants was a bullmastiff-rottweiler cross dog called Monarch, put forward by owner Joanna Robinson.

Ms
Robinson, 43, from Walsgrave, said: ‘It would be wonderful if Monarch 
got through. He’s my little boy. I’ve got a big personality and love 
people. I love animals too. 

‘I’ve got plenty of life experience and I hope to get a job out of it and be successful.’

Corey Smith, 26, made a grand entrance to his audition, beat boxing and singing.

He said: ‘I’ll bring something different. I’ve got a bit of swagger. We haven’t seen any of that on TV yet, you know what I’m saying?’

Luci Adamson, 19, of Keresley Village, said: ‘I always fancied being on TV. I’m the kind of person who tells people how it is. 

‘I don’t sugar coat anything and sometimes I don’t think before I open my gob.’

Louise Smith, 28, said she hoped the reality show will highlight more serious issues.

The hairdresser, of Radford, said: ‘My mum has dementia and we found out her cancer came back after four years. 

‘It’s very hard to live at home with a loved one has dementia. She’s only 64. If there is anything I can do to help and raise awareness then I’ll do it. I want people to know they are not alone.’

‘The audition was nerve-racking but I talk to loads of people in my job. I hope I’m picked, it would make my mum so happy.’
