Return: Comedienne Tracey Ullman is to comeback to BBC with six-episode sketch show

She made her fortune when her career took off in the US and now comedienne Tracey Ullman is set to mark her UK comeback - with a six-episode of her sketch show on BBC1  

Worth an estimated £75million, the mother-of-two is a far cry from the star who was introduced to the public in Three of a Kind and A Kick Up the EIghties. And thanks to The Tracey Ullman show, she became one of the few British acts to break the American market.  

Also a Hollywood actress, Miss Ullman said yesterday the BBC had transformed since her original stint at the Corporation.

She said: ‘It’s a privilege to be doing this. I still feel as inspired to inhabit people as I did when I was six, standing on the windowsill in my mother’s bedroom, putting on a show.

‘The BBC has changed a bit since the last time I worked here, when it was all men in bow ties who had completed National Service. Now there are a lot more women. Great ones. 

'The important things haven’t changed, though. The BBC still provides an environment that allows you to the freedom to create the best shows possible.’

Shane Allen, head of comedy at the BBC, called Miss Ullman’s return to BBC1 a ‘homecoming’ and said: ‘We’ve got Tracey Ullman returning to our screens to do what she does brilliantly – a multi-character sketch show. 

'She’s won 7 Emmys for her work and she’s always been the one who got away for British comedy, a huge talent and it’s an enormous privilege to welcome her back to the BBC.’

A source at the BBC added: ‘Tracey is a huge talent who has the comedy world at her feet so for her to choose to come back to the BBC feels like a real coup for the corporation.

Before heading across the Atlantic, she had built a career on the stage and then found fame on television among a generation of comics that included Lenny Henry, Rik Mayall, Robbie Coltrane and David Copperfield.

But it was not enough for Miss Ullman, who headed to across the Atlantic to forge a new career. With The Tracey Ullman Show in the late 1980s, she became one of the few British acts to successfully break the American market and the first foreign-born female comedian to do so.

The variety show not only won a string of top awards, including a Golden Globe, but also gave cartoon The Simpsons its first chance of television as a regular segment on the programme.

She is now bringing the programme to the BBC as part of its new comedy line-up, announced yesterday. Other highlights include The Ronnie Barker Comedy Lecture, in which a big comedy name – yet to be announced – will discuss the role the art form has in a free society.

Other BBC stalwarts will be making their usual appearances. A programme has been commissioned to mark the 25-year partnership of Harry Enfield, 53, and Paul Whitehouse, 56, and there will also be new offerings from Rory Bremner, 53, and Death in Paradise star Ben Miller, 49.

As well as acting, Miss Ullman has appeared in Hollywood films such as The Corpse Bride and Into the Woods, and made her fortune flipping high-value homes in Los Angeles with her husband, Allan McKeown.

The Award-winning producer of his wife’s show Tracey Takes On…, Mr McKeown died on Christmas Eve 2013 at the age of 67 from prostate cancer, three days before the couple’s thirtieth wedding anniversary.

They had two children, Johnny McKeown, 26, who has followed in his mother’s footsteps to become an actor, and Mabel, 28, who is a manager at charity International Medical Corps and previously worked for Labour’s deputy leader Harriet Harman. 

She unsuccessful sought selection as the Labour candidate for the Neath constituency, in Wales, at this year’s general election.

This political inclination towards left-wing politics runs in the family as Miss Ullman is a known Labour supporter and is friends with the party’s former leader Neil Kinnock.

While she has gone on to such stellar success, Miss Ullman did not have an easy start to life. She was born in Slough in 1959, to a middle class family. She was the youngest of two daughter born to Polish émigré Anthony Ullman. 

Mr Ullman was a key figure in the local Eastern European community and sold suits made by his English seamstress wife Dorin.

She lost her father at the age of six when he collapsed and died from a heart attack while reading her a bedtime story. 

His death saw the family’s fortunes change and they moved to Hackbridge, southwest London, where her mother was forced to work a series of odd-jobs to make ends meet.

She has previously said of the loss: ‘After he died, our fortunes came and went because Mum couldn’t speak Polish and had to give up the business. 

'When I meet other girls who lost their fathers when they were young, I really relate to them. You become independent quickly; I could cope with anything because of that terrible loss.’

Despite struggling for money, Miss Ullman has said her mother would only ever refer to the family as middle class out of a sense of pride and because ‘we had money at one time.’

Mrs Ullman then had an unhappy second marriage and, after it ended, the family moved around the country several times.

Miss Ullman always had dreams of performing and would put on shows for her mother with her sister Patti. At 13, she visited a clairvoyant who predicted she would find fame in America.

She won a scholarship to respected stage school Italia Conti and, aged 16, she landed her first job dancing in Berlin. The following year she was performing in a show in Blackpool alongside Les Dawson.

She said: ‘He was terrific. He had a great brain and he liked smart women. I used to drink scotch and smoke cigarettes with him in his dressing room.

' And he was the first person to say to me: `You know, you’re very funny. You should do more comedy. You won’t be a dancer for ever.’ I remember taking that very seriously.’

She went on to have a short-lived career as a pop singer before marrying Mr McKeown, 15 years her senior, in 1983. 

A successful producer with interests in Los Angeles as well as London, They moved into Steven Spielberg’s old house in California when she was pregnant with Mabel and she was happy to try her hand at comedy in America.
