With their own fashion empire, a combined wealth of £130million and a starring role in Prince William and Kate’s love story, John and Belle Robinson seemed to have assembled the perfect life.

But the founders of the Jigsaw clothing chain have decided that their marriage is no longer the perfect fit – and are set to divorce today.

More than 20 years after their relationship began, Mrs Robinson, 50, and her 67-year-old husband will formalise their separation with a ‘quickie’ divorce hearing at London’s High Court.

Jigsaw founders: John and Belle Robinson, who have a combined wealth of £130million, are set to divorce

The Robinsons are close friends with the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and hired Kate (pictured wearing a Jigsaw cardigan) in 2006 at their head office when she first moved to London after graduating from university

The pair count the Middleton family among their close friends, and their instrumental role in the royal courtship began when they hired Kate to work at their head office in 2006 when she first came to London after graduating from university.

They regularly gave their glamorous young employee the use of their luxurious villa on Mustique in the Caribbean for private romantic holidays with the prince.

Today, District Judge Aitken is expected to accept that their marriage has irretrievably broken down and grant the couple a decree nisi at the Royal Courts of Justice.

The couple will then have to wait for a decree absolute, which is usually issued six weeks and a day later, ending their marriage. Neither Mr nor Mrs Robinson or their legal representatives are expected to attend the hearing.

Mrs Robinson is understood to have spent much of her time recently at the pair’s sumptuous flat – believed to be worth around £3million – in the heart of Chelsea. Mr Robinson is understood to have been based at their £5million manor house in Chippenham, Wiltshire.

The couple’s wealth has been estimated by the Sunday Times Rich List at £130million.

When she revealed a year ago that they were separated, mother-of-five Mrs Robinson said: ‘I’m absolutely devastated.

‘It’s not something I wanted, but we seem to have drifted apart. We actually split up five months ago, but we’ve managed to carry on keeping up appearances and keeping it fairly quiet.

‘My life is changing and I’m having a rethink. Those golden days when Kate [Middleton] came over and I fixed her up with a job seem a long way off. I’m still trying to fathom out what went wrong with me and John.’

Mrs Robinson was previously married to an army officer and was a struggling single mother of two when she met Mr Robinson. By 1993, she was pregnant with the first of their three children together, although they did not marry until 2004.

The Robinsons have founded a total of 60 Jigsaw stores in Britain, as well as others in the U.S. and Australia

Together, they built Jigsaw into a thriving success story, with 60 shops in Britain and others in America and Australia. They soon had the money to buy their luxury holiday home, Villa Hibiscus, on Mustique.

When the pair separated, Mrs Robinson said: ‘I want to be able to stay friends and have a drink with him one day.

‘I suppose John and I will divorce eventually, but I will always love him. After three children together and the life we’ve shared, nothing will change that.’

Last night neither Mr nor Mrs Robinson was available for comment.
