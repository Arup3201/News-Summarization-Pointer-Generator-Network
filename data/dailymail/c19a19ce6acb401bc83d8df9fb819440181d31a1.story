Harry Martin, a film student, went missing when he went out to take black and white photographs of the coast near his home, his parents believe

A student may have been killed by storms when he went out to take photographs of the scenery, an inquest heard yesterday.

Harry Martin, 18, is believed to have gone out to take black and white pictures of the coastline near his home in Membland, Devon on January 3.

The former Greenwich University student's naked body was found eight days later in a remote gully near Carswell Cove in the Noss Mayo area of south Devon.

Today, the Plymouth, Torbay and South Devon coroner Ian Arrow recorded an open verdict in the case.

He concluded that Harry’s death was caused by ‘immersion in water'.

During
 the inquest, the teenager's family learned that he had suffered a 
broken shoulder blade before his death. It is suspected that the injury 
was a result of a heavy fall.

The coroner said: 'He has fallen heavily and fractured his shoulder and found himself in the sea.'

Mr Arrow said Harry, a film student at the London university, was naked when he was found.

But the coroner said that it was not possible to determine whether Harry 
had removed his own clothes to try and get buoyancy in the water, or 
whether the storms had washed them off his body.

Harry’s mother Georgina Martin said that her son had bought an old 35mm camera on eBay which she had not been able to find.

She
 said he was ‘absorbed completely’ with his studies saying: 'I think he 
went to go out and experiment with black and white film which to his 
generation was a novelty.'

Harry was identified by dental records and police said there were no 
suspicious circumstances and no third party involvement in his death.

A post mortem could not say he drowned but his death may have been caused by ‘his sudden immersion in cold water’.

Harry could either have fallen over and plunged into the water, or washed away from the ground by the stormy seas, the inquest heard.

Dan Fellows found Harry’s body on January 11 as he and other colleagues used kayaks to search Carswell Cove.

He said he almost overlooked the area by one cove but found legs dangling from a gully after he clambered over rocks.

His aunt, Alison Marshall, saw him heading up a hill near his home on 
the day he vanished ‘carrying an object in his right hand’.

She said he ‘waved and grinned’ at her as he walked away on the ‘fine, dry, sunny day’.

Mr Arrow said: 'Harry was making the most of the weather conditions.'

Another
 witness, Susan Lovett, said she saw a young man fitting Harry’s 
description standing in a local creek when the tide was out - but 
Harry’s family rejected that sighting saying it was in the wrong 
direction and that man was not wearing Harry’s clothes.

Detective Constable Dan Wojciechowski said all the evidence pointed to ‘Harry’s death being a sad and tragic death’.

He said: 'There is no evidence of third party involvement or any suspicious circumstances at all.'

The coroner told the inquest that Harry had fallen and ‘subsequently went into the water, or the water 'came up to him’.

The
 coroner also said he could not answer Mrs Martin's question about whether Harry 
would have been conscious from his fall and able to walk to safety.

He said that Harry’s face had been deformed by him being washed around by the sea and dashed against the rocks.

Mr Arrow commended the actions of the local community who went out searching for Harry for days on end.
