Graphic video of a white rhino that had its horns, tongue, nose and eyes savagely hacked off by poachers has gone viral online - illustrating the brutal damage poachers inflict.

Found alive in the Kruger National Park (KNP), South Africa, the rhino's injuries, visible in the video, were so severe the animal had to be euthanised.

The video was originally posted in April 2013 and Mpumalanga reported at the time that there had been a sharp spike in intrusions to the national park.

South African National Parks said the incident took place on March 31, 2013, with one arrest made, a .385 rifle, ammunition and poaching equipment recovered. The badly mutilated rhino was found nearby and bleeding.

Park commanding officer Maj Gen (Ret) Johan Jooste said there were 56 incursions recorded by KNP between March 21, and April 1, 2013 - a period when poachers took advantage of two long weekends.

'While the whole country was relaxing, the battle to save our rhino was at its peak in the area. Our men in uniform were kept busy by greedy bandits who wanted to plunder our natural heritage,' Jooste said.

At the time he thanked rangers for their 
work. 'These past two long weekends - if it were not for their 
dedication, we could be counting huge losses,' he said.

South African National Parks said that during the intrusions there were six incidents of shots being fired, four sightings of groups of poachers - who in some instances escaped back into Mozambique - and four contacts with poachers.

Of the four contacts, one was fatally wounded on March 30 and another is believed to have committed suicide on April 1.

The video is a timely reminder about 
the impacts of poaching, with Prince William calling for 1,200 ivory 
artefacts in Buckingham Palace to be destroyed to send a message to 
illegal elephant poachers.

Among the priceless artefacts are items including a throne from India dating back to 1851 that belonged to Queen Victoria.

Despite
 the call,Â  Prince Harry was swept up in the controversy when pictures 
emerged of him crouching over the body of a large water buffalo during a
 hunting trip on an Argentinian farm in 2004.
