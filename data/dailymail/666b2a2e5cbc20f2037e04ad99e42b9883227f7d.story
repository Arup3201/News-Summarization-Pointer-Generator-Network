Five years ago England beat Spain to win the Under 17 European Championships. The winning goal came from a striker who burst powerfully into the box, between two opponents, before firing home a sweet shot into the corner beyond the keeper. A cool finish on a big occasion.

A few months later, I saw him come on as a substitute in the Championship and display some clever touches and neat footwork. He stood out as one of the more technically gifted players on display in the second tier game.

Fast forward a few more months and that teenage striker - playing in the Championship - picked up the ball in his own half, ran towards the opposition goal, beat two defenders, wrong-footed the keeper and slotted into an empty net.

Connor Wickham made a disastrous decision to move to Sunderland when his career was flying

In the Championship, he impressed and looked like one of the most technically gifted players on the pitch

Two weeks after that he scored a hat-trick.

In the summer of 2011 he made what has proved to be a catastrophic career move. He signed for Sunderland.

To those who didn't follow Connor Wickham's career before he went to the North-East, all they will know of him is that he is highly-paid, and not exactly outstanding.

Sure, there was a flurry of goals to help Sunderland stay up at the back end of last season, but that has been it.

Stories emerged last season of his big spending - £17,500 on a gold bottle of champagne, and a £140,000 Ferrari. These barely make a dent in his £60,000-a-week salary, and they look cheap compared with team-mate Steven Fletcher and his £260,000 Lamborghini parked next to his £160,000 Bentley. These underachieving Sunderland players don't mind showing off their wealth, do they?

Stories have emerged of Wickham's extravagant spending - £17,500 on a bottle of champagne, for example

In a loan spell at Sheffield Wednesday, he also impressed - there is no mistaking his ability as a footballer

Is it something about the club that means these players have no self-awareness whatsoever? Is nobody at the club telling them that all the time they're so truly terrible on the pitch, it might be a good idea to keep things on the down low off the pitch?

One of Wickham's managers called him 'a playboy model,' and said he needed a 'slap in the face' to help him realise his talent.

And make no mistake, Wickham is a very talented footballer. Unfortunately he chose the wrong club.

Since Wickham joined Sunderland he has had 10 different managers at club level, including his loan spells. That is not the ideal environment for young talent to be nurtured and flourish. Managers come and go so quickly that the pressure for immediate results is huge, so the time a manager can devote to individual players on and off the pitch is restricted.

Wickham should be spearheading England Under 21s' Euro campaign but he has not been selected 

The 21-year-old has been stuck out on the left for Sunderland when he is clearly a centre-forward

At a more stable club, the chances are that Wickham might have a better environment to succeed.

On the pitch he has been stuck out on the left when he is obviously a centre forward. That's where he did so well at the end of last season.

Off the pitch, has the so-called 'playboy model' been guided properly?

Evidence suggests not: Gus Poyet even admitted he ignored Wickham when he first arrived at the Stadium of Light as manager. He revealed he didn't even sit down and talk to the player.

Sunderland signed Wickham but their duty doesn't stop there. They need to provide that player with every chance to succeed. Hopefully stability will reign at the Stadium of Light in the near future, Wickham will get the right guidance off the field, and he will be allowed to play to his strengths on the field.

Sunderland need to provide their players with a chance to succeed but Wickham has not been guided

Sunderland are a basket case of a club and Wickham made the wrong decision when he joined them

Five years on from scoring a wonderful goal to win the European Championship for England I am disappointed Wickham is nowhere near the senior squad as we prepare for a Euro 2016 qualifier this week.

Even more worrying, repeated pull-outs from the Under 21 squads mean he's way down the pecking order, even with injuries this week. He should be spearheading our charge to the Euros in the Czech Republic this summer.

The ongoing debate about English talent failing to develop after promising early signs needs to look at examples like Wickham. All the ability, but no significant strides made.

He should have made that progression. The fact that he hasn't is down to Sunderland being a complete basket case of a club.

Let's hope for Wickham's sake – and England's – the next chapter for Sunderland will help him become the player he should be.
