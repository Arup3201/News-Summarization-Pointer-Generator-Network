Three hospital patients have died after contracting a new strain of the superbug Clostridium difficile (C. diff).

Doctors in Scotland have been alerted to the strain, named ribotype 332, which has been reported for the first time by Health Protection Scotland (HPS).

HPS said two patients being cared for at the same hospital died - one in December and the second in January.

A third patient within the same health board area died last month. All were seriously ill with underlying conditions.

HPS did not disclose the hospital locations due to patient confidentiality.

A statement said: 'All three cases were severely ill due to other underlying conditions and died following their episode of CDI (Clostridium difficile infection).

'This is the first published report of C difficile PCR ribotype 332 in the UK and worldwide.

The report said: 'All three cases were severely ill due to other 
underlying conditions and died following their episode of CDI (C 
difficile infection).

'HPS has alerted clinicians and laboratory staff throughout Scotland.

'The identification of a novel ribotype does not require any immediate changes to surveillance or in the antibiotics used to treat CDI.'

A CDI is a type of bacterial infection that can affect the digestive system. It most commonly affects people who are staying in hospital.

Symptoms include diarrhoea and abdominal cramps and it can also cause life-threatening complications such as severe swelling of the bowel.

Two of the patients who died were cared for at the same hospital, while the third patient was being treated nearby. All were seriously ill with underlying conditions (file picture)

HPS said new ribotypes have emerged 'frequently' over the last decade.

A ribotype is the pattern of DNA fragments particular to a bacterial strain. Ribotyping is the name given to the process of identifying this pattern which allows scientists to differentiate between different strains.

Camilla Wiuff, strategic lead for microbiology at HPS, said the cases were not classed as an outbreak because the third case had not been linked to the first two.

She told The Scotsman: 'But it is an interesting finding that we have this same ribotype and we are doing further investigations to see if there are more patients with this ribotype.'

Past samples are now being re-examined to see if the 332 strain could be present and may have been missed.

She said the 332 strain had occurred on one occasion previously somewhere in Europe, but this had not been the subject of an official report.“It is quite a common event that new strains develop all the time. It is a natural evolution of genetics in the bacteria,” she added.
