Federal authorities have lodged two criminal charges against a Phoenix, Arizona woman accused of throwing a shoe at Hillary Rodham Clinton while she gave a convention speech at a Las Vegas Strip resort.

Alison Michelle Ernst, 36, didn't respond to a phone message on Monday about the charges of trespassing and violence against a person in a restricted building, which were filed Sunday in U.S. District Court in Las Vegas, Nevada.

She could face up to a year in federal prison on each charge if she's convicted. A court date wasn't immediately set, and it wasn't clear if Ernst had a lawyer.

Alison Ernst was arrested April 10, 2014 for throwing a shoe at Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton

Las Vegas police booked Ernst last week on a misdemeanor disorderly conduct charge and freed her with a June 24 court date. Charges haven't been filed in that case.

A disorderly conduct conviction could get Ernst up to six months in county jail.

Ernst immediately surrendered and was arrested after the incident Thursday in a ballroom at the Mandalay Bay resort.

The federal charges accuse her of 
bypassing security to enter the ballroom and committing a violent act by
 throwing the shoe that police say she pulled from a purse and hurled 
about 60 feet toward the former secretary of state.

Clinton expressed surprise but wasn't struck by the shoe. She made a couple of jokes and continued her speech before more than 1,000 people at a recycling industry conference.

'Is that somebody throwing something at me?' Clinton asked.

'Is that part of Cirque du Soleil?'

An orange-and-black athletic shoe was recovered from the stage.

Clinton, who was not hit by the object,  responded to the misfire by joking about the incident

Ernst acknowledged throwing a shoe but didn't explain her actions to reporters as she was taken into custody by the U.S. Secret Service.

The incident reminded some of an Iraqi 
journalist throwing shoes at former President George W. Bush during a 
Baghdad news conference in December 2008. Shoe-throwing is considered an
 insult in Arab cultures.

Clinton
 has Secret Service protection because former presidents and their 
spouses are covered for their lifetime, said Brian Spellacy, head of the
 U.S. Secret Service office in Las Vegas.

Clinton,
 the former first lady and Democratic senator from New York, has been 
giving paid speeches to industry organizations and Democratic Party 
groups around the country. She has said she's considering a presidential
 bid.

Radar Online reports
 that Ernst involved in this incident is the same Allison Michelle Ernst who
 showed up at an August 2012 court hearing for Aurora movie theater shooter James 
Holmes and started screaming.

'I tried to deliver information vital to the defense of James Holmes to the public defender,' she said before being escorted out.

She
 later filed a preliminary injunction for a restraining order against 
Holmes because she accused him of 'entering my mind though subliminal 
messaging and causing me to be obsessed with him on  a daily basis'.

'I
 sleep, eat, and think James Holmes 24/7 and I seek a restraining order 
to have this James Holmes mind manipulation to stop,' she wrote in the 
injunction.

'I watched
 Inception, so Iâ€™m fully aware of James Holmes magical powers... James 
enters my head like Dennis Quaid in inner space and he zooms my heart 
and plays with it and forces me to care for him.

'Holmes wonâ€™t even look at me (in court)... this offends me, my life and skin. James Holmes is being framed.

'They
 wanted to Tim McVay [sic] him...Much like James Holmes, [McVeigh] was a
 mind-controlled patsy that they dumped the blame for the bombing on,' 
she wrote, referencing the Oklahoma City bomber.
