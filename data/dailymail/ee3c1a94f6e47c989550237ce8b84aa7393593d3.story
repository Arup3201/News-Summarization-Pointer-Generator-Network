Movie theater shooting suspect James Holmes set up an elaborate booby trap system in his apartment, which included improvised napalm and thermite, to pull cops away from the massacre, it was claimed in court on Tuesday.

Holmes, who is accused of opening fire at moviegoers during a midnight screening of The Dark Knight Rises last July is charged with more than 160 counts, including murder and attempted murder.

The previously unheard details of Holmes' plot were laid out in court today during an ongoing hearing as prosecutors presented their case against the 25-year-old.

Plot foiled: Police investigated the apartment after Holmes had admitted to the officers who arrested him that he had set booby traps

FBI bomb technician Garret Gumbinner testified that the traps included improvised napalm and thermite, which burns so hot that water can't put out the flames.

Three different ignition systems were found in Holmes' apartment, Gumbinner said.

There was a thermos full of glycerin leaning over a skillet full of another chemical. Flames and sparks are created when they mix, and a trip wire linked the thermos to the door.

Police said Holmes had hoped that boom box set to blast music on a timer would lure someone to the apartment.

The revelations came one day after police officers testified that Holmes admitted his apartment had been booby-trapped as they took him into custody.

Prosecutors are trying to show in what is expected to be a weeklong hearing that the attack in which 12 people were killed and 58 wounded on July 20 was a premeditated act.

Defense attorneys say he is mentally ill.

Horror: Authorities say Holmes entered the theater with a ticket and propped open a door, went to his car and returned with weapons

Daniel King, one of Holmes' lawyers, on Monday pointedly asked a pathologist who had just detailed each of the fatalities: 'You're aware that people can be found not guilty on the grounds of insanity?'

When officers arrived at the theater, they found Holmes standing next to his car.

In addition, the magnitude of the attack could be heard in the first 911 call to police, which was played today in court. It lasted 27 seconds and police say at least 30 shots could be heard.

The call came in 18 minutes into the showing of 'The Dark Knight Rises.'

Police also played a 911 call from a teenage cousin of 6-year-old Veronica Moser-Sullivan, the youngest person killed.

A dispatcher tried to talk her through CPR but she sounded panicked and said she couldn't hear.

A bearded and disheveled Holmes stared straight ahead as the calls were played and didn't show any emotion.

Holmes watched intently yesterday as one detective showed a surveillance video of him calmly entering the theater lobby, holding the door open for a couple behind him, and printing out tickets to the midnight showing of the film that he purchased electronically about two weeks earlier.

Authorities did not show a video of the attack but say Holmes, wearing body armor, tossed two gas canisters into the packed theater, then opened fire.

Legal analysts say that evidence appears to be so strong that Holmes may well accept a plea agreement before trial.

Jailed: Holmes is charged with killing 12 people and wounding 58 when he opening fire at a Dark Knight Rises screening in the Denver suburb of Aurora last July

While prosecutors have yet to decide on whether they will seek the death penalty, such a plea could get Holmes a lesser sentence, such as life in prison; help the state avoid a costly trial; and spare survivors and families of those who died from the trauma of going through a lengthy trial.

Yesterday, the first responders to arrive after Holmes waged the shooting rampage gave harrowing accounts of the massacre in court.

The first to speak was Officer Jason Oviatt from the Aurora, Colorado Police Department.

He was the one who ordered Holmes onto the ground and handcuffed him after he spotted the alleged shooter 'just standing there' in full swat gear.

The hearing will be the best 
opportunity yet for survivors to find out about Holmes' mental state and
the sequence of events that led up to the attack.

The hearing will allow the judge to 
determine whether the prosecution's case is strong enough to warrant a 
trial, but it's rare for a judge not to order a trial if a case gets 
this far.

Account: Officer Jason Oviatt recounted seeing 'a trail of blood that led to the theater' as he first confronted Holmes, who was wearing a helmet and gas mask and 'immediately put his hands up' when ordered to freeze

Officer Oviatt said: 'He seemed very detached from it all. Very, very relaxed,' according to NBC.

Oviatt was among several officers who spoke in court on the first day of pre-trial hearings for Holmes.

The policeman had been working the late shift when 911 calls came through.

Oviatt recounted seeing 'a trail of 
blood that led to the theater' as he first confronted Holmes, who was 
wearing a helmet and gas mask.

He said at first he thought Holmes was a fellow cop, because he was 
dressed in body armor, but he grew suspicious as he noticed Holmes was sitting calmly, and not running toward the murder scene.

Oviatt said he pointed his gun at Holmes, who 'immediately put his hands up' when ordered to freeze. He then handcuffed him and searched him.

He
said he found two knives and a semi-automatic handgun on top of Holmes'
car, adding that an ammunition magazine also fell out of Holmes' pocket
and he found another one on the ground.

Sick: Defense attorneys told the judge Holmes was mentally ill, and may call witnesses in the preliminary hearing to testify to his mental health

Holmes was dripping of sweat and his pupils were wildly dilated as he told the officer that his apartment had been booby trapped.

Officer Justin Grizzle testified that Holmes had a 'smirk' on his face as the carnage unfolded around him.

Fighting back tears, Officer Grizzle recalled today how he saw 'several' bodies - and slipped on blood that was on the floor as he entered the theater.

Grizzle recalled 
taking some of the wounded to the hospital and said he had to stop one 
man who was worried about his seven-year-old daughter from jumping out 
of the moving patrol car.

He said there was so much blood in his car that he could hear it sloshing around.

A third officer, Aaron Blue, recalled 
arriving on the scene to find 'a lot of people coming out of the theater
screaming,' and testified about how he and his partner transported one 
woman to the hospital as he sat in the back seat cradling her head.

As Sgt Gerald Jonsgaard recalled not 
finding a pulse on the youngest victim, six-year-old Veronica 
Moser-Sullivan, a woman in the courtroom sat with her head buried in her
hands.

Det Matthew Ingui 
said that he was responsible for evidence-gathering in the wake of the 
shooting, examining surveillance video and Holmes' cell phone.

Ingui found that the 25-year-old had purchased his ticket to the film on July 8, nearly two weeks before the shooting.

The
court was shown videos, including one of Holmes walking around outside 
the doors of the theater and of moviegoers desperately fleeing through 
the same doors.
