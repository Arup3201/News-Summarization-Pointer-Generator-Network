When the largest shopping centre in the world opened in 2005, it was dubbed the Great Mall of China, and around 70,000 shoppers were expected to flock there each day.

The South China Mall seemed to have it all: an 82ft Arc de Triomphe, a 1.3-mile canal complete with gondolas, and an enormous indoor and outdoor roller-coaster.

There was only one thing missing: the shops.

A monument to failure: The mall in Dongguan has never got off the ground

They were missing when the mall in the Chinese city of Dongguan opened in 2005, when fewer than 99 per cent of the stores were leased, and they are still missing now.

Occupancy rate at the 7m square feet mall - the largest in the world in terms of leasable space and more than twice as big as the largest mall in the US, the Mall of America - is still lying at one per cent.

Those who hoped the South China Mall would herald a new dawn in which China would consume what it produced, rather than simply export it, have seen their hopes dashed.

The mall was dreamt up - and paid for - by Alex Hu Guirong, a Dongguan native who became a billionaire selling instant noodles.

It was designed around seven zones, each representing a city, country or area: Amsterdam, Venice, Paris, Rome, Egypt, California, and the Caribbean.

Designers were sent around the world for two years scouting for good locations for zones, and car park spaces were built for all the shoppers who would drive there.

But the project never took off, and eight years on, it is still lying fallow.  (Meanwhile the largest shopping centre in the world by total area, the Dubai Mall, is now the world's most visited shopping and leisure destination with more than 54m visitors a year.)

In the Chinese mall, sheets lie draped over unmoving escalators, old decorations still hang, covered in dust, and the only movement is the odd crisp packet blown by the wind along an empty corridor.

Instead of shop assistants, the few people employed in the echoing centre are security guards paid to sit on chairs and keep vandals out.

A handful of businesses still operate, mostly fast-food restaurants to serve the families who bring their children to the amusement park and IMAX cinema outside the mall.

But the vast majority of the mall, including what should have been a gleaming hotel for all the destination shoppers, remains empty.

Chinese retail experts say one of the problems is the lack of transport infrastructure to bring the shoppers in.

Now known as the 'New' South China Mall (the 'New' was added in a failed relaunch in 2007), it doesn't lie on any major transport network or nearby airport, and can take hours to get to via public transport, even for those living a short distance away.

A reporter who wrote this detailed account of the mall for Vagabondjourney.com said it took him more than two-and-a-half hours to get to the mall by bus from six miles away.

But even if the locals could get there, they might not want to.

Dongguan has a population of more than 10m, but with most of the inhabitants working in the city's factories, they do not have deep enough pockets to do justice to a a high-end shopping centre.

China has also been badly hit by the global recession, with its export market suffering from the financial woes of the United States and Europe.

The mall is now owned by the Founders Group, a division of Beijing University, but any plans they have for its future remain to be seen.
