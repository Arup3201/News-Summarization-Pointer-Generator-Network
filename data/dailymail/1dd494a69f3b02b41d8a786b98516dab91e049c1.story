A trainee Mormon priest who flashed at two women said he became 'confused' after watching too much Babestation TV.

Royston Thompson, 25, was initially caught exposing himself to a woman he was attracted to while in his dressing gown.

After being released on bail ahead of 
his sentencing he exposed himself again - this time to a female doctor 
who he asked to inspect his genitals.

Flasher: Royston Thompson, 25, exposed himself to a woman who had parked outside his house and to a doctor, the court was told

He left a note on his first victim's car which said he would 'love to give her a full body rub and make love to her.'

As she got into her vehicle parked outside Thompson's front door she spotted him performing a sex act in his doorway in Darlington, County Durham.

At a previous hearing, Thompson said his behaviour was merely 
'flirting' like the women on the Babestation channel which features glamour models 
writhing provocatively while they urge callers to ring in.

He told the court on that occasion: 'I
 have learnt my lesson but it was nothing more than harmless flirting, 
like the women on Babestation do every night.'

Teesside Crown Court heard today that Thompson had watched 'too much pornography' and become confused before committing the act.

Ian West, prosecuting, West said Thompson told police he was in 'training to be a priest in the Mormon Church.'

He was found guilty of exposing himself on August 10 last year after a trial at Newton Aycliffe Magistrates on January 19.

After being released on bail ahead of his sentencing he exposed himself again - this time to the female doctor who he had asked to inspect his genitals.

Thompson went to see her about a bad back and after she examined it he then complained about a lump on his left testicle.

He insisted that she had to have a look at it - despite her suggesting he saw a male doctor.

He then dropped his trousers revealing that he was aroused, the court heard.

At a previous hearing, Thompson said his behaviour was merely 'flirting' like the women on the Babestation channel which features glamour models writhing provocatively while they urge callers to ring in.

Mr West said: 'She (the doctor) examined his testicles to confirm there was no lump. The defendant asked her if she was sure about that and if she wanted to check again.'

When Thompson pulled his trousers back on, he asked the doctor: 'How was that for you?' Mr West told the court.

The doctor warned Thompson to be careful what he said because she had read about his exposure to his first victim in the newspaper.

Thompson was arrested and initially denied the offence but later decided to plead guilty.

Today Judge Howard Crowson sentenced him to 16 weeks behind bars.

He told Thompson he should expect to serve a further 32 days in prison on top of the time he has already spent on remand.

The court heard Thompson has an extensive record of offending, beginning when he was just ten-years-old and continuing until he was 21.

Martin Towers, defending, passed on a message on behalf of Thompson, from Darlington, County Durham.

He told Judge Crowson: 'He is sorry, he had been watching too much pornography and he had, in his words, become confused and he asks me, again on his behalf, to assure the court that nothing like this will happen again.'

The judge said Thompson’s actions 'must have been distressing' to his victim.

He told the defendant: 'I hope very much that what is said on your behalf is true and you have learnt your lesson.'

Thompson replied: 'Definitely,' and later told the judge: 'I won’t be coming back again.'

He was ordered to sign the sex offenders register for the next seven years.
