Rocked: Many in the Hayes Valley were surprised that gang-related violence would happen in their 'safe' neighborhood

'Moved from Booklyn to SF for this?' resident Chris Surowiec tweeted shortly after the shooting. 

'It’s surprising,” Redwood City resident Landon Fabianski, 19, told SF Gate. Fabianski works at a men's clothing store on the Hayes Street, the main thoroughfare in the neighborhood. 'I thought it was more of an upscale neighborhood. I never thought there would be a shooting of that nature here.' 

'It seems like such a nice, safe neighborhood,' added shopper Heather Houston, 33.

Police were first called to the scene around 10pm on Friday night when residents started reporting more than a dozen gunshots. All four inside the car died at the scene.

Julie Albin was driving past the intersection of Laguna and Page Streets the moment gunfire rang out. 

'I'm a little jarred right now that I witnessed that,' she told ABC 7. 'I wasn't sure what it was at first but now that I see it I'm a little freaked out that we were right next to them.'

Shocked: Resident Julie Albin was driving by the intersection when the shooting happened. 'I'm a little jarred right now that I witnessed that,' she told ABC 7 .

A 'possibly silver Scion' was seen speeding away, according to reports, but police have yet to release a firm description of the vehicle.

San Francisco broadcaster KGO reported some bullets struck inside surrounding homes, including one that lodged in a refrigerator.

By early Saturday, police had covered some areas of the shooting scene with yellow tarps, cordoned off several blocks and began canvassing the area for witnesses.

Police believe the car in which the men were killed may have been stolen, the San Francisco Chronicle reported. 

Police Chief Greg Suhr says the gang task force and homicide units are working together to investigate the shooting. 

He said four guns were likely used in the shooting, and that two were found inside the stolen car parked at Page and Laguna Streets. 

In memory: On Saturday, residents set up a makeshift memorial near the scene of the shooting which reads: 'Drive-by, 4 people, rest in peace'

While police patrols were increased in the neighborhood over the weekend, in case of retaliatory attacks, Suhr said the attack appears to have been targeted and neighbors have no need to fear.  

While newer residents of the neighborhood were shocked by the shooting, longtime residents saw Friday's tragedy as a reminder of Hayes Valley's once-seedy past. 

Before the Lomo Prieta earthquake of 1989, the old Central Highway passed through Hayes Valley, and was a magnet for drug and other criminal activity. 

While Hayes Valley itself has evolved over the past few decades, it's still surrounded by more precarious neighborhoods.

Board of Supervisors President London Breed grew up in public housing near the Hayes Valley neighborhood and knew some of the victims' families. 

'It’s really hard. It’s heartbreaking to the community, and it’s heartbreaking toward the families. A lot of people are hurting right now,' Breed told SF Gate. 

On Saturday morning, a priest at the nearby San Francisco Zen Center set up a makeshift memorial for the four people killed. It reads: 'drive by 4 people rest in peace' and is surrounded by flowers. 

'I had hoped violence and the causes of violence in the neighborhood were done,' priest Victoria Austin, 61, told USA Today. 'It's not over. It's a shock to everyone. It's painful and we don't know much about it.'
