Companies which bombard the public with spam text messages, silent phone calls and junk emails could escape prosecution because of a legal ruling, the privacy watchdog warned last night.

Christopher Graham, the Information Commissioner, said the deluge of unsolicited material was ‘one of the great curses of the age’ which he was increasingly powerless to stop.

His warning follows a court case in which a judge ruled a company could not be fined hundreds of thousands of pounds despite bombarding phone users with millions of text messages over three years.

Companies which bombard the public with spam text messages, silent phone calls and junk emails could escape prosecution because of a legal ruling, the privacy watchdog warned last night

Tetrus Telecoms was originally fined £440,000 but won on appeal after a tribunal ruled the text messages were only a minor nuisance and did not cause ‘substantial damage and distress’.

Mr Graham said: ‘We could show there was nuisance - that isn’t enough apparently’ - as he called for the law to be changed.

‘We have just got to lower that hurdle because I think if you ask most people they would say silent calls and unsolicited spam texts are one of the great curses of the age - and if the Information Commissioner can’t protect you it’s a poor lookout.’

Experts suggest the ruling makes it hugely difficult, if not impossible for the Information Commissioner’s Office - the watchdog charged with protecting the public against the tidal wave of junk - to issue fines.

The Commissioner said the public were worried about the growth of the NHS care.data programme which was designed to harvest patients¿ data on a huge database

Ministers have suggested they could pass a new law, and Mr Graham is appealing the ruling - but until the legal position is clarified there are few deterrents for companies issuing spam messages.

The fine was first handed down in November 2012 against two men, Christopher Niebel and Gary McNeish. Niebel, who was hit with the bulk of the fine, appealed and won.

An ICO probe found their firm was 
sending huge volumes of text messages from offices in Stockport and 
Birmingham without phone users’ consent and in breach of the law.

The
 company made huge profits of around £8,000 a day from passing on 
personal details of anyone who responded to messages calling on them to 
make a legal claim following an accident or if they had been mis-sold 
Payment Protection Insurance.

An
 ICO spokesman said the judgment was ‘disappointing’. He said: ‘The 
public is clear that it wants to see a stop put to nuisance text 
messages. The fines we issue help to achieve that, and if we are 
prevented from issuing fines then it’s fair to expect that the public 
will receive more of these messages.

Mr Graham said the public were much more concerned about privacy concerns than the stories about data collection by the security services gleaned from secret files stolen by Edward Snowden (pictured)

‘This is another reminder of why we’re pushing for a change in the law to make it easier for us to issue penalties.’

Mr Graham also said the public were very concerned about the growth of the NHS care.data programme which was designed to harvest patients’ data on a huge database.

The project was put on hold for six months last week following privacy concerns.

In an interview with the Independent Mr Graham said the public were much more concerned about that issue than the stories about data collection by the security services gleaned from secret files stolen by Edward Snowden.

Mr Graham said: ‘People have been challenging me on the bus about care. data. That’s the talking point but Snowden hasn’t been, which is kind of a surprise.’

He criticised the NHS’s efforts to explain the care.data system - which included leaflets sent to households in England and not a personalised letter as he advised.

‘They said "No, we’re going to do a leaflet." I never received my leaflet,' he said.
