When Aberdeen host Celtic in the month of November, tradition dictates that fireworks are always likely. 

Aleksandar Tonev’s seven-match ban for racially abusing Shay Logan has the potential to make the meeting of the clubs at Pittodrie a week on Sunday downright incendiary.

When the teams last met in September, Tonev clashed with Logan in the 55th minute of play. Only two men know what really happened but the Aberdeen defender accused his opponent of saying ‘get your hands off me, you black c***’.

Tonev has always maintained that Logan misheard him. Indeed, speaking when on international duty with Bulgaria this month, he insisted: ‘The racism case against me is now closed.

‘Celtic had four videos of the incident which proved there was no racial slur.’

Yet there appears to be no video evidence to support Tonev’s claim. And the SFA were moved to deny the case had been settled.

Hampden’s disciplinary tribunal sat for four hours yesterday hearing evidence from both sides before handing Tonev a seven-game suspension which, if upheld, will keep the player on the sidelines until the New Year.

Such an absence from the game may be the least of his worries. To say the verdict, Celtic’s subsequent appeal not withstanding, places Tonev’s career on the line is hardly an exaggeration.

Logan is an honest, intelligent footballer. It’s difficult to imagine him fabricating such a serious accusation, knowing the impact it would have on the reputation of an opponent.

After clashing with Tonev, he was so incensed he ran towards referee Bobby Madden before relaying the accusation to his captain Mark Reynolds.

Celtic have backed Tonev and deny that he is a racist, despite the outcome of the disciplinary hearning

When Aberdeen scored, late in the game, he utilised the break in play to repeat his claim to manager Derek McInnes, who gave evidence to the Hampden hearing yesterday.

Bluntly, Celtic believe the evidence presented by Aberdeen was flimsy. There were no third-party corroborating witnesses. It was, in essence, one man’s word against another. Under questioning, Tonev told Celtic officials Logan had ‘misheard’ what he actually said.

There was no smoking gun for the governing body to study. No microphone recording or CCTV images a lip-reader might analyse closely.

Aberdeen quite simply presented the more credible witnesses and the decision was made on the ‘balance of probabilities’. Can of worms barely covers it.

Last night, Celtic manager Ronny Deila maintained Tonev’s innocence. As a club, the Scottish champions have resolved to stand by their player and will appeal within five days of being formally notified of the decision.

Reiterating a previous stance, the Norwegian insisted: ‘I’m sure that he (Tonev) hasn’t said that towards the player.

‘It’s important to understand that people make mistakes.

‘Everyone makes mistakes – I’m now talking generally. We have to assess it from there.

‘Of course we have no support for racism – that’s clear. We will have nothing about that.

‘But sometimes as a young player, stupid things happen all the time with smaller issues.

‘This is something we will need to assess but I really believe in him.’

Within Celtic, he is not alone. The Parkhead club carried out their own internal investigation, interviewing Tonev and, privately, senior figures at the club express astonishment at the SFA’s decision.

Tonev’s parent club Aston Villa have been reported as being ready to use the verdict to rip up the winger’s contract. Yet when Celtic contacted Villa figures, including manager Paul Lambert for background statements on Tonev, there was consensus that the allegations were far out of character.

Celtic assistant manager John Collins accompanied the Bulgarian midfielder to his hearing on Thursday

Last night all Villa would say was that they ‘will make no further comment while an ongoing process remains in place’.

As Celtic begin their appeal, the search for a precedent leads obviously to the Luis Suarez-Patrice Evra incident back in 2011. As a Manchester United player, Evra accused the former Liverpool striker of racist abuse.

Suarez was charged with ‘abusive and/or insulting words and/or behaviour contrary to FA rules’.

The comparisons between that case and this are obvious. Like Tonev, there was no substantial, irrefutable evidence the Uruguayan had, as suggested, branded the Frenchman a ‘negro’ five times.

When the FA issued a 115-page verdict, they conceded Evra had simply been the more believable witness, with the testimony of Suarez considered dodgy and inconsistent with video pictures.

Like Celtic, Liverpool were irate.

At the time they said: ‘We find it extraordinary that Luis can be found guilty on the word of Patrice Evra alone when no one else on the field of play – including Evra’s own Manchester United team-mates and match officials – heard the alleged conversation.’

That argument held little weight. Suarez was handed an eight-match ban and a £40,000 fine. Case closed.

At the moment we are operating very much in the dark. The written reasons for the SFA’s decision might have been released next week but will now be delayed pending the Celtic appeal.

The Parkhead club will call on some heavy duty, expensive legal assistance in an effort to commute the suspension completely. Reducing the ban to three games is not an option. Tonev either made racist remarks or he didn’t.

Collins and Tonev leave Hampden after hearing the result, but the club have insisted they will appeal

Neither is it clear when an appeal will be held. With Celtic in Europa League duty in Romania next week, it seems unlikely a panel can be convened before the champions visit Pittodrie a week on Sunday.

An SPFL encounter as raw and unpleasant as the increasingly messy, tangled legal wrangle enveloping Aleksander Tonev already looks more likely than not.

Deila is maintaining his defence of the former Lech Poznan player.

‘He’s never shown a bad attitude here,’ the Celtic boss added yesterday. ‘He’s a calm, nice boy and he just needs confidence.

‘He’s an athlete and we have to work on his choices and decision-making. But as a professional, I have nothing bad to say about him.

‘He has to work hard every day to improve. He was out for a long time before he came here and his confidence was not the best.

‘We must work every day to get that feeling we have with John Guidetti and all the others.

‘We have to work all the time on getting to know each other and doing the best thing for every player.’

Deila may well be right that Tonev is a ‘nice boy’. Rarely, however, has that been a suitable defence.
