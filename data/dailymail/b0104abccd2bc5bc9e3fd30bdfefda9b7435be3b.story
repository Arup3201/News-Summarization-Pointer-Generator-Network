These curious pictures look as though they could be of some mysterious cosmic event - but in fact they are artworks created using a high-powered drill.

The power-tool art attack is the work of Fabian Oefner who captures the flight of paint from the end of a drill bit with a camera exposure of just one 40,000th of a second.

His latest 'Black Hole' series celebrates the physics of centripetal force and the effects it has on simple paint and an ordinary drill with a metal rod on the end.

Swirling: Mr Oefner uses an exposure of just one 40,000th of a second to capture these amazing freeze-frames

Colourful: Centripetal force flings the paint from the drill bit at high speed to make these mesmerising patterns

Vibrant: 'The motion of the paint happens in a blink of an eye,' Mr Oefner said

Methodical: The artist connects a sensor to the drill bit to fire his camera and flash at just the right moment

Spiral: Mr Oefner's gear is capable of making flashes as short as 1/40,000 of a second, freezing the motion

The incredible result of Mr Oefner's work comes out looking like a picture taken on the Hubble Telescope of some cosmic event.

The 29-year-old, from Switzerland, said: 'The motion of the paint happens in a blink of an eye, the images you see are taken only millisecond after the drill was turned on.

'To capture the moment, where the paint forms that distinctive shape, I connected a sensor to the drill, which sends an impulse to the flashes.

'These specialised units are capable of creating flashes as short as a 1/40000 of a second, freezing the motion of the paint.'

Cosmic: Mr Oefner said his work was trying to bring the worlds of art and science together in one place

Wild: Jackson Pollock's drip paintings gave Mr Oefner the inspiration for this series of pictures

Difference: Unlike Pollock, however, the focus of these artworks is the action itself, Mr Oefner says

Anger: Many of the pictures look like silly string swung around in a circle

Mr Oefner said his work was trying to bring the worlds of art and science together in one place.

'The way that the structures and colours you see in the images are created was by using very simple, scientific phenomena,' he said.

'By showing this phenomena in an unseen an poetic way, I would like to invite the viewer to find out more about it, which will hopefully make us appreciate the magic that's constantly around us even more.

'The inspiration for this project in particular comes from looking at the drip paintings of Jackson Pollock.

'Contrary to Pollock`s masterpieces, which show the result of his action painting, I am putting the focus on showing the action itself.'

Mr Oefner's work has just been exhibited in Zurich, Switzerland, and featured in both scientific and art journals.
