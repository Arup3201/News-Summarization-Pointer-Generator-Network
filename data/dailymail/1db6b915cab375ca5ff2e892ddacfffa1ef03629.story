One 5-year-old girl from Dickisnson, Texas who has a rare form of terminal cancer got her dream come true on Wednesday when friends and family organized a princess parade.

Claire Lankford has always wanted to be a princess but unfortunately she's been fighting an incurable cancer called rhabdomyosarcoma since she was 3-years-old.

On Wednesday, the girl's family dressed her in a pale yellow dress like Belle from 'Beauty and the Beast' and they organized for her to ride in a horse drawn carriage around the neighborhood.

The girl's mother, Patricia Lankford is the principal at Hughes Road Elementary School in Dickinson, Texas.

She told station KHSB about the difficulties her young daughter has had to face.

'She went through 42 weeks of chemotherapy and four weeks of radiation on her chest and six weeks of radiation on her spine,' said Claire's mother.

'Throughout her treatments she did not have her hair, her eyebrows or eyelashes but she was a source of joy for the doctors and nurses. She would walk around the hospital saying, "Good evening, good afternoon."'

'She walked the hallways receiving chemo and at the same time spreading joy,' said Patricia.

Last month, Claire's cancer jumped to the final stages as doctors found five tumors on her lungs and on her lymph nodes.

Now, Claire's family's main concern is that their daughter feel loved.

Hundreds gathered for the princess parade on Wednesday and neighbors carried signs and tossed flowers.

'We just want her to know she is loved. I think that's what anyone would want to know in their lifetime,' said Claire's father Kevin Lankford.

'You take one day at a time and you remain thankful for each day you have. That's my message to everyone be thankful for your family members because life can change in a heartbeat,' said Claire's dad, Kevin Lankford to My Fox Houston.

Even though Claire doesn't have much time left, she is making the most of the time that she does have.

A local bridal shop helped to transform Claire into the beautiful princess she is on the inside.

'From the toes to the tiara, we like to make sure our princess has that wonderful touch of glitz and glamour. ... It's so humbling. It's amazing to think that we can have such a little part in such a big scheme of things,' said Daniell Smith of Jill's Fashion and Bridal to ABC.

Claire dressed as a princess along with her mother. Her father was dressed as a prince. The family shared a beautiful moment that none of them will ever forget.
