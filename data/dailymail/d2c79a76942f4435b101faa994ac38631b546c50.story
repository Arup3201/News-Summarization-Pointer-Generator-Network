After an incredible year that saw the tiny French club of Luzenac promoted into Ligue 2, this should be one of the season of honorary president Fabien Barthez's life.

But the dream is now over for the former Manchester United goalkeeper. The biggest fairytale story in European football will end with an amateur club in the seventh tier without him involved. So, what happened?

Denied a place in the second tier in France because of their stadium size, the club were also told by the French Football Federation (FFF) that they won't be rejoining the National Championship despite finishing second in the division last season. Barthez says the 'story ends here.'

Where the tiny village of Luzenac is in France

The village of Luzenac Ariege Pyrenees contains just 650 inhabitants, and is tucked away in the Ariege Pyranees in France. 

Barthez, who was born just 30km away in Lavalanet was handed his role in 2012, a year after Jerome Ducros bought the club with the intention of bringing success to the region. It didn't take long.

The French Federation deemed their original stadium of the Stade de Paul Fedou to be too small, with just one stand holding around 400 supporters, so their wild celebrations upon achieving promotion in April took place at the Stade de Courbet in Foix,  20km from home.

Luzenac stormed through the National with the help of Cameroonian striker Ande N'doh, top scorer in the division with 21 goals; manager Christophe Pelissier was on the verge of greatness, a step away from one of the top five divisions in Europe.

Though the possibility of denial into the league above lingered, pre-season didn't start too badly. A draw with local rivals Toulouse, a mainstay in Ligue 1, gave fans hope that they could not only compete, but excel in Ligue 2.

But now, it is all over. The Barthez project, that is.

'The refusal to accept Luzenac into the National brings an end to our project,' Barthez is quoted as saying in Get French Football.

'We can not accept residing in CFA2 (5th division) with players who had earned their place in Ligue 2. 

'We were given no promises of an automatic rise next season either. For us, Jerome and me, it's over, the story ends here.'

Barthez and Ducros met with the FFF on Wednesday but they couldn't find an agreement to reinstate the club back into a professional league.

All players who did their utmost to achieve their great feat will be released from their contracts, with their second team now set to step to the fore down in the amateur seventh division.

Barthez made it his duty to pick the new signings, and he did so with pinpoint accuracy. He attracted Ligue 1 and Ligue 2 outcasts desperate for a new adventure who would find it hard saying no to a World Cup winner.

One of those men was Nicholas Dieuze, 35, a man who had played 157 games for Toulouse. Even a man with such experience couldn't believe what was going on.

'Who would have thought that five months after our promotion to Ligue 2, we'd be saying goodbye to each other in a car park?' lamented Dieuze to AFP.

'I feel a lot of sadness about what's been done over recent years.

'They're sending us to DHR (division d'honneur regionale) with a great kick up the bum. In two weeks, we'll no longer speak about Luzenac.

'The players, like many people in France, will go down to the dole office.'

Many will say that a village of this size with a stadium of this size are back to where they belong. But Luzenac had earned it. Barthez had earned it.
