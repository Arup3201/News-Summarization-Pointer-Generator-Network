A Connecticut woman accused of plowing her car into a convenience store at a speed of up to 70 mph and injuring four people has been charged with drunken driving and other crimes.

Thirty-one-year-old Rosa Blanca Chavarria-Medina of Bridgeport was charged on Monday with driving under the influence and reckless driving, among other things.

 charged with reckless endangerment, reckless driving, DUI, passing on 
the right, suspended license and failure to stop at stop sign.

Chavarria-Medina was unconscious in her car, which briefly caught fire, and had to be freed from the car by firefighters.

'We
 want to show that her speed was a factor not only in the accident but 
recklessness of her behavior,' said Fairfield Police Lt. James Perez 
told WFSB.

Authorities say Chavarria-Medina's blood-alcohol level was more than three times the legal limit of .08.

Chavarria-Medina posted $5,000 bail. There is no phone listing for her and it's not clear if she has a lawyer.
