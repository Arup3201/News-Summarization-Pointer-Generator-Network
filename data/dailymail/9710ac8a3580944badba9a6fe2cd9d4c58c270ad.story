He might have been a bikie - but behind Randall 'Animal' Nelson's gruff beard and  leather exterior was a kind-hearted man who showered children in gifts and offered shelter to the homeless.

Hundreds, including distinguished guests and close friends, filled Sydney's  Wayside Chapel on Saturday to mourn the decorated Kings Cross identity who was remembered as 'a bloke with a beard, a bike a banner and a big heart.'

Rows of shiny motorcycles crowded entry points to the tiny  Kings Cross  church as well-wishers gathered by the side of their Harley-Davidson's before a path was cleared for colourful.

Kings Cross Bikers revved their motors as the sound of loud engines, cheers and applause reverberated through the ears of all who attended. Everyone was encouraged to be as 'cheeky' as they wanted in sharing memorable stories of the 75-year-old.

Hundreds turned out for the memorial service as many shared jokes and laughed about the 75-year-old's colourful life 

There were more smiles than tears during the ceremony as people were asked to remain positive and keep light hearted 

One of the speakers who identified himself as 'Dave' told of how he almost committed suicide before his run in with Animal

Reverend Graham Long said that 'A good man has died...he traded in his OAM for an OMG at the pearly gates'

Wayside Chaplain Graham Long made several jokes during the ceremony

There was no shortage of support at Sydney's Kings Cross on Saturday

Motorcycles were Animal's most prized possessions and it was said that he never washed his motorcycle 

Children, pets, patches and flowers adorned the coffin before it was brought in to the Wayside Chapel

Over four decades Animal helped countless charities and individuals in need and it was in 2004 that the then NSW Governor was awarded him an Order of Australia.

In 1989, along with fellow riders 'Steptoe' and 'Feral', Animal founded the Kings Cross Bikers club

'Our club charter is clear,' Animal once said. 'We look after the elderly, we visit the jails, we counsel the sick and addicted...and we make sure no one gives their family up'

Animal died of a long battle with lung cancer at age 75

'A bloke with a beard, a bike a banner and a big heart' Randall 'Animal' Nelson was loved by all

Former State Governor Marie Bashir declared she 'envied.' Animal, a man who over four decades helped countless charities and individuals in need and it was in 2004 that the then NSW Governor was awarded him an Order of Australia. 

'I was the proudest girl in the world to have my photograph taken alongside him on his motorbike,' Ms Bashir said.

'It still sits on my desk in Governor House.' 

She said to her, Animal was a friend, and no  matter what status you held in society he treated everyone equally. 

'He had an innate, incredible kindness and had the well-being of sick children in his mind,' she said.

'Bikies, if I can call them that, for what I can say I envied them for all their excursions.'  

The unlikely friendship was  one which many others shared with the 75-year-old including 'Dave' who was one of of Animal's many adopted children.

They first met when he was 15-years-old.

'I was on my way to commit suicide,' Dave recalled.

'But then this guy came up to me in a leather jacket....it was the first Christmas present I'd been given.'

Animal handed him a two-year-old Easy rider magazine and a pair of socks.

'I read that magazine until it fell apart and wore those socks until they wore themselves.' 

Before his death Animal described his childhood as 's***house'. Very little was actually known about his past, but It was generally agreed he spent years in state-run homes in Victoria and left school as young as 12 to work as a jackaroo.

There might have been a serious horse-riding accident along the way, and it appeared he had ridden a motorcycle into Sydney in 1956.

There was a stint in National Service and a couple of stints behind bars. Some media reports claim he has nine children. Close friends say they know of none. 

In 1989, along with fellow riders 'Steptoe' and 'Feral', he found the Kings Cross Bikers club.

'Our club charter is clear,' Animal once said. 'We look after the elderly, we visit the jails, we counsel the sick and addicted...and we make sure no one gives their family up.'

Members of different bikie associations fronted the chapel service for Animal on Saturday

For two decades he spent part of every day in his sixth-floor public housing unit at Waterloo, in inner-city Sydney sorting, wrapping and packing presents for Sydney's sick and underprivileged until his death last month from cancer.

To thousands of admirers he was the Kings Cross Santa Claus, and just like Santa's fabled North Pole workshop, the old biker's tiny inner-city home was packed year-round with Christmas gifts.

An emotional President of Kings Cross Bikers club Rick 'Chips' Johnson said he was not a man of 'material' wealth, however he did hold one possession close to his heart more than any other - his 'trusty steed.'

'Material things didn't matter,' Chips said. 

'But his trusty steed (motor-tricycle) was the one and only possession of importance.' 

St Vincent's Hospital chairman Peter Joseph said Animal was 'a bloke with a beard, a bike and a banner and a big heart.' 

'As far as I was concerned he had a heart as big as Pharlap.' 

He was a champion for everyone doing it tough, including those holed up in a hospital  facing imminent closure in the mid 1990s by the then state Labor Government.

Cost saving measures were being introduced and part of the hospital was preparing to be relocated to Kogarah, in Sydney's south. 

Mr Joseph said Animal was one of the driving forces which helped save the hospital from ruin.

'We were running full page advertisements in The Sydney Morning Herald,' he said. 

'We needed names to put on this open letter, and we didn't want names from the big end of town we wanted people from all over.'  

A call to a man  named Animal had his signature on a piece of paper and today it means St Vincent's Hospital stands as one of the nation's fore-running health units.

'We won that battle and the rest was history.'  

Ron Brown, president of the National Servicemen's Association, said he was 'one in a million.'

'He always gave his time and energy.'

For many, Animal played a major role in their lives
