Pies and ice cream have been a long been a staple at the American dinner table.

But a new report suggests the nation's love affair with dessert is waning because of the preparation time and cost.

Market research company, NPD Group, tracked the daily eating habits of 5,000 consumers across the country and found that only 12 per cent tucked into a sweet treat after dinner in the home.

A sweet goodbye: Pies and ice cream have been a long been a staple at the American dinner table - but a new report suggests the nation's love affair with dessert is waning because of the preparation time and cost

It marks a decline from 15 per cent ten years ago and a dip from 24 per cent back in 1986.

Despite healthy eating drives, experts say the trend has nothing to do nutritional concern and is simply down to making life simpler.

Of the dessert eaters, almost 20per cent said easy-to-prepare fruit was their favorite option.

Fifteen per cent plumped for cake, while 13 per cent preferred a few scoops of ice cream or cookies.

The faithful pie came in at fourth place with 8.9 per cent plucking up the energy to slice it up and another classic - brownies - came bottom of the pile.

Older Americans, adults over 65, were revealed as the heaviest dessert eaters

Commenting on the findings, Harry Balzer, senior vice president and chief food industry analyst at NPD, said: 'Dessert adds to the effort of making a meal.

'You have to prepare it and clean up, plus it adds to the cost of the meal. It’s one more thing Americans are learning to do without.' 

Fruit - 19.7 per cent

Cake - 14.3 per cent

Ice cream -13.9 per cent

Cookies - 13.8 per cent

Pie - 8.9 per cent

Frozen Novelties - 6.3 per cent

Candy - 5.3 per cent

Pudding - 3.8 per cent

Salty snacks - 2.8 per cent

Brownies - 2.7 per cent

Older Americans, adults over 65, were revealed as the heaviest dessert eaters. 

They reported eating a sweet course at home twice as often as any other age group.

However, even they are cutting back. 

For the year ending February 2014, people over 65 ate 76 desserts per person per year at home. 

In 2000, they ate 104 desserts per person per year at home. 

The analysis came from the NPD Group's 29th annual Eating Patterns in America report. 

Balzer suggests the culinary trend in American homes is about one-dish main meals.

He jokingly concluded: 'If this trend continues, desserts may entirely disappear from the dinner table.

'We are on target to serve the last dessert on Feb. 27, 2054.'
