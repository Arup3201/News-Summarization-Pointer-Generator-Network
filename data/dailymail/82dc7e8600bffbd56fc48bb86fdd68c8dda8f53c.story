The eight-year-old daughter of Russian oligarch Boris Berezovsky who was found dead at his UK home has paid tribute to her father saying he was 'an inspiration' to her and had a 'joy for life'.

An inquest heard this week that the 67-year-old was found lying on the floor of the bathroom at his home in Ascot, Berkshire, on March 23 with a ligature around his neck and a cause of death was given as 'consistent with hanging'.

His daughter, Arina Berezovsky, said in a statement released through Thames Valley Police: 'I didn't know my dad very well but what I am sure of is that he really loved his family and that he was always happy around his children and grandchildren.

'His life was a turbulent roller-coaster with never-ending ordeals, and I admire the way in which he handled them with utter grace, control and most commendably honesty.

'Unfortunately, honesty does not 'cut it' in this corrupt world and is often mistaken for being manipulative; which my dad was not.

'He had a certain joy for life, which was beautifully refreshing, and never took anything he had for granted.

'His all-consuming determination for justice will be an inspiration to me for the rest of my life and I aspire to one day have half the courage he did when standing up for his beliefs; even if he had to stand alone.

Mr Berezovsky fell out with Russian President Vladimir Putin and often feared for his life

'My hopes for him now are that he is at peace and that he is happy.'

The inquest opened on Thursday by Berkshire coroner Peter Bedford was adjourned until a date to be set.

Mr Berezovsky fell out with Russian President Vladimir Putin and often feared for his life - prompting speculation in Britain and Russia over the manner of his death.

Even though police said they have found no evidence that anyone else was involved, it has not stopped widespread speculation.

Specialist officers in chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear substances examined the country mansion in Mill Lane before declaring it safe.

Officers said they are speaking to the Russian's close friends and family to build up a picture of his state of mind in the last days of his life.

It is thought that he was having serious financial difficulties after paying out astronomical sums in legal fees over the last few years, and wanted to return to Russia.

His eldest daughter, Elizaveta Berezovskaya, 43, an artist who grew up in Moscow but now lives in Surrey, described her father this week as 'one of the greatest men of our time' who she is sure 'has left some surprises'.

Speaking just days after his death, she told the Independent on Sunday he did no favours in the UK by not explaining his past.

She said: 'He is one of the greatest people of our time.

will have to wait quite a time to fully understand what he was, as you 
do with great men. 'I'm sure he has left some surprises.

In court: Chelsea Football Club's Russian owner Roman Abramovich

The oligarch, who last year lost a multibillion-pound High Court battle with Chelsea Football Club owner Roman Abramovich, could have run up more than £100 million in legal bills since 2011.

In July 2011, he paid out Britain's biggest-ever divorce settlement to his ex-wife, Galina Besharova. Reports suggested the deal was worth more than £100 million.

He later built up fees totalling more than £250,000 after becoming embroiled in a case at the High Court with his former partner, Elena Gorbunova, who sat at his side throughout much of his battle with Mr Abramovich.

Mr Berezovsky emigrated to the UK in 2000 after falling out with Mr Putin.

In fear for his life, he sought political asylum in the UK and moved to the South East, buying upmarket properties in London's Knightsbridge and in Berkshire.

The businessman survived a number of assassination attempts, including a bomb in his car which decapitated his chauffeur.

He became a vocal critic of Mr Putin's rule in Russia, where he had become a wanted man.

In 2006 the Kremlin accused foreign-based opponents of fatally poisoning former KGB spy-turned-dissident Alexander Litvinenko.

It was thought that Russia was in part referring to Mr Berezovsky, who denied the allegation and accused Mr Putin of personally being behind Mr Litvinenko's death from radioactive polonium-210 poisoning.
