A self-confessed 'nerd' who has appeared on numerous game shows may be the worst contestant in British history - after failing to win a single one.

James Robinson, 26, has been a regular contestant on half-a-dozen programmes since he was 14-years-old but has so far failed to scoop a top prize.

But Mr Robinson, from, Milfield, West Yorkshire,  hopes his 12-year unlucky streak will change when he appears on the revamped Fifteen to One on Wednesday.

Weakest link: James Robinson, 26,
has been a regular contestant on half-a-dozen of programmes since he was 14-years-old - but has failed to ever win one

Contestant: James Robinson pictured at the age of 15 on Countdown in 2003 when Carol Vorderman was still on the show

Second time... unlucky: James Robinson, then 21, appeared on Countdown for a second time in April, 2009 - but didn't win

He said: 'I haven’t actually won any money on the shows yet but I put that down to just being unlucky.

'I have a Pointless trophy and a Countdown goodie bag though.

'I’ve always liked watching game shows but I particularly like Countdown because of the anagrams, I like figuring those out.'

He revealed how his passion for game shows began with his love of learning when he was at school.

He said: 'I used to sit and read an atlas in the library in high school to learn all the flags for the different countries.

'I’d learn the capital cities and countries, any knowledge that I could possibly use for game shows really.'

Determined: James Robinson, pictured on Junior Mastermind in 2013, has not been deterred by his lack of success - and is still applying to appear on other shows

Zero: James Robinson, then aged 23, pictured on the game show Pointless with his friend Steve Ball in 2011. Despite the added help, they both lost

Unlucky streak: James Robinson, then 24, pictured on the show Breakaway in 2012 - which is also failed to win

But despite his dedication, he is yet to strike it lucky on any of the game shows he has appeared on - including Pointless, Breakaway, Mastermind and Countdown twice.

He has also been knocked back from The Chase after making it through the auditions stage 16-months-ago.

'I really want to go on that show,' he admitted. 'But I auditioned and haven’t heard anything back.

'I want to try and get on as many shows as I can and I’ll keep going for as long as it is possible.'

His closest brush with glory came when he appeared on Pointless in 2011 with friend Steve Ball but sadly he missed out on his first game show title.

Disappointed: James Robinson has lost six times - but says he hopeful his luck may be about to change

He said: 'Pointless really is a nerd’s dream game show as you have to know such obscure knowledge.

'Me and my mate Steve actually got to the final and gave two pointless answers along the way which is a great achievement.

'But then we gave three wrong answers so unfortunately we were out.'

The game show fanatic is also trying to get places on BBC One’s Perfection and National Lottery-Who Dares Wins and also Channel Four’s Only Connect.

But before he embarks on a trio of gruelling application processes he has hinted the Wheel of Fortune has turned in his favour on his most recent TV appearance on Fifteen to One.

He said: 'I can’t tell you too much but I was quite happy with my performance.'
