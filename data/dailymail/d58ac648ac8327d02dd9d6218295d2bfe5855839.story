It's the most important meal of the year and is often shared by a large group of friends and family.

But more than a third (39 per cent) of Britons confess they don't make a plan or use recipes when making Christmas dinner.

Thirteen per cent of cooks fail to defrost the turkey on time, while one in 10 (nine per cent) admit their timings always get muddled up.

Kitchen confusion: One in ten managed to get their timings muddled up when cooking Christmas dinner 

Eighteen per cent of people polled for a survey say they have actually burnt their Christmas dinner, while almost one in five serve lumpy gravy (19 per cent).

One in 10 (9 per cent) admit their timings always get muddled and things aren't ready at the same time, a third (32 per cent) find undertaking the 'big food shop' stressful, and a quarter (24 per cent) dread the clean up after dinner.

While four per cent of parents have to think up recipes to incorporate different tastes or fussy children.

Washing up after Christmas dinner is hated by nearly a quarter of those surveyed in the poll

Preparing food over the period - 48%

Not making a plan to make dinner - 39%

Undertaking the big food shop - 32%

Cleaning up after dinner - 24%

Making lumpy gravy - 19% 

Burning/overcooking Christmas dinner - 18% 

Not defrosting the turkey/meat on time - 13% 

Getting food timings muddled up - 9%

Forgetting a particular ingredient and not knowing what the best substitute is - 8%

Thinking about what to do with leftovers and how to minimise wastage - 8% 

Having to cater for unexpected guests - 7%

Recipes to incorporate different tastes  - 4%

One in 10 (eight per cent)  worry about what to do with leftovers or having to cater for an unexpected guest (seven per cent). 

The poll was carried out by Flora, whose Technical Chef, said: 'We know undertaking the big food shop is stressful and the common mishap of forgetting a particular ingredient and not knowing the substitute is a pain.

'A great way to help lighten the load when it comes to family cooking is by planning your menu and recipes in advance.

'Family foodies worrying about their feast-mas are not alone; we found one in two (48 per cent) find buying and preparing food, and catering over the Christmas period stressful; while a quarter (24 per cent) dread the clean up after dinner.' 

The 12 pains of Christmas released by Flora reveal more of the unlucky mishaps that add to the festive traditions, such as forgetting to buy batteries for new toys (36 per cent), not having a gift for someone who has unexpectedly bought you one (35 per cent) and missing the date for the Christmas post (33 per cent).
