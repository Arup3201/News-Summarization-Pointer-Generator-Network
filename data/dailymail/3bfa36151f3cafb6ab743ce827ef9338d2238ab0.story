World class: Ivory Coast midfielder Yaya Toure (left) had an outstanding season for Manchester City

This is 
the battle of the top two, with Colombia enjoying a stylish victory over
 a weak Greece and Ivory Coast coming from behind to beat Japan.

Intriguingly,
 referee Howard Webb may have England’s World Cup future in his hands. 
This game could go a long way to deciding who finishes top and if Roy 
Hodgson’s side make it through they will face a team from this group in 
the last 16.

One to watch: James Rodriguez

Rodriguez pulled the strings in an attacking midfield role for Colombia in their 3-0 win over Greece and will be hoping to do more of the same against Sabri Lambouchi’s men.

Man of the moment: Rodriguez (No 10) was instrumental for Colombia against Greece

Key clash: Teo Gutierrez vs Sol Bamba

Bamba
 looked shaky in Ivory Coast’s hard-fought victory over Japan in the 
opening round of games, particularly when the ball was on the deck. 
Gutierrez, who enjoys running with the ball at his feet, will try to 
exploit this at Estadio Nacional.

Familiar face

Wilfried Bony. Swansea star scored the first against Japan.

History lesson

Ivory Coast have lost their only two games against South American opposition.
