Mike Phelan's aim of becoming a manager in his own right after 12 years on Sir Alex Ferguson’s backroom staff has moved a step closer after he was put in temporary charge of Norwich City. 

The 52-year-old is now favourite to take over at Carrow Road on a permanent basis, having served his old club as assistant to Gary Megson in the mid-90s and, more recently, first-team coach under Neil Adams. 

Sportsmail assesses Phelan’s credentials for the job and looks at how some of Ferguson’s other right-hand men have fared on their own.

Mike Phelan – 2008-2013

You couldn’t wish for a much better grounding than to work under one of the most successful British managers of all time, and Phelan’s CV is impressive indeed; a Champions League, three Premier League titles and two League Cups during his five-year stint as Ferguson’s No.2, having spent the previous seven years as first-team coach at Old Trafford.

He brings an insatiable winning mentality and knowhow that is tried and tested at the highest level. The problems encountered by David Moyes and, to some extent, Louis van Gaal prove that success at United is far from guaranteed despite having a first-class set-up and a world-class squad.

Some would argue that Phelan lacks experience as a manager in his own right, and the ‘buffer’ role he played so well to smooth the relationship between Ferguson and the dressing-room will be of little use as he makes the step up. But according to Phelan, he was manager in all but name during his time as Ferguson’s assistant before Moyes deemed him to surplus to requirements following his appointment at Old Trafford in the summer of 2013.

‘That’s what I was doing for the last five years, albeit with the title of assistant boss,’ says Phelan, who took charge of United once – a League Cup tie at Scunthorpe in 2010 – when Ferguson was in Spain to watch David de Gea before signing him from Atletico Madrid.

‘Sir Alex was the head of the establishment, there’s no doubt about it and rightly so. He didn’t get to where he’s got through not being a big decision-maker but he’ll be the first to admit that a lot of people played their part in that.

‘We weren’t the face of what was going on but that was our job. You were decision-making so I’m more than capable of handling that.’

Now that Phelan has the opportunity to put his experience to use at Norwich, it will be interesting to see how he gets on considering the mixed fortunes enjoyed by the rest of Fergie’s assistants down the years.

Archie Knox – 1986-91

Ferguson’s No.2 at Aberdeen made the move to Old Trafford with him in 1986 and stayed for more than four years before taking over as Walter Smith’s assistant at Rangers a week before United were due to meet Barcelona in the European Cup Winners’ Cup final. Knox helped Smith win six Scottish titles in seven years before they moved to Everton, and has been a serial No.2 since at Millwall, Coventry, Livingstone, Bolton, Blackburn, Motherwell and Aberdeen again. The 67-year-old is now in charge of scouting and recruitment at Dundee.

Brian Kidd – 1991-98

Kidd left Ferguson’s side to take over as manager of Blackburn Rovers and it proved to be a disastrous move as he lasted less than a year at Ewood Park. The split also prompted Ferguson to criticise Kidd in his first autobiography, accusing him of going behind his back to complain to the Old Trafford board. However, a coach who is credited with polishing United’s Class of ’92 into first-team stars has gone on to find great success on the backroom team at Manchester City, helping the noisy neighbours win two Premier League titles.

Steve McClaren – 1999-2001

Moved from Derby during United’s famous Treble-winning season and went on to help Ferguson land three titles in as many years before leaving to take over at Middlesbrough. McClaren became the club’s most successful manager in Boro’s history, winning the League Cup and reaching the UEFA Cup final during his five years in charge. The 53-year-old has since enjoyed great success at FC Twente in Holland and is prospering back at Derby. However, moves to Wolfsburg and Nottingham Forest did not work out, and he will always be haunted by his ill-fated spell in charge of England and that ‘Wally with the Brolly’ tag.

Jimmy Ryan – 1998-99 and 2001-02

The Scot served as assistant either side of McClaren’s arrival and even took charge of the team for a 3-2 defeat at Middlesbrough in 1998 while Ferguson was attending a funeral. But it was only ever a short-term measure and Ryan was appointed head of the club’s youth academy and worked for another 10 years before his retirement in 2012.

Carlos Queiroz – 2002-03 and 2004-08

The much-travelled Portuguese coach twice left his role as Ferguson’s assistant and it didn’t go to plan on either occasion. After following David Beckham to Real Madrid in the summer of 2003, Queiroz lasted less than a year as head coach at the Bernabeu as his star-studded Real side finished fourth in La Liga. Then he quit Old Trafford again in 2008 to take charge of Portugal, but after needing a playoff to qualify for the 2010 World Cup he was sacked when they failed to score in three out of four games in South Africa. The 61-year-old enjoyed a happier World Cup in 2014 in his current job as coach of Iran.

Walter Smith – 2004

Smith helped United win the FA Cup during his short-term spell at Old Trafford before taking the Scotland job, having previously worked by Ferguson’s side at the 1986 World Cup in Mexico. However, he is better known as a manager in his own right and had two hugely successful spells as manager of Rangers and four years in charge of Everton.

Rene Meulensteen – first-team coach, 2007-13

Another key member of Ferguson’s backroom team who was released with Phelan following the appointment of Moyes, Meulensteen has struggled to find his feet elsewhere. The Dutchman lasted just 16 days in charge of Russian club Anzhi Makhachkala, and was then sacked as Fulham boss after little more than two months at Craven Cottage. Currently working in a consultancy role for Philadelphia Union.
