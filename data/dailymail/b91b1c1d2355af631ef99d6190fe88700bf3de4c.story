She began her career as a teenager  posting videos on YouTube about fashion and beauty from her bedroom.

But seven million subscribers later internet superstar Zoe Sugg, 24, better known as Zoella, has bought herself a £1million five-bedroom mansion in the Brighton area.

Miss Sugg will share the house with blogger boyfriend Alfie Deyes, 21, and says that she has christened the house the 'Zalfie Pad.'

Made for two: Miss Sugg will share the house with blogger boyfriend Alfie Deyes, 21, and says that she has christened the house the 'Zalfie Pad'

She tweeted her fans: 'It has been a secret and this is the first time Alfie and I have lived together. 'Moving house is stressful and time consuming. We have rooms full of boxes.'

The young couple will also have five en-suite bathrooms, solid oak floors, a designer kitchen and a log cabin to enjoy in their first home near the picturesque South Downs. 

The £1million house and celebrity lifestyle came six years after starting her video-blogging site at home.

Ms Sugg grew up in Lacock, Wiltshire, the daughter of a beautician mother and a property developer father. 

After finishing her A-Levels at the local Corsham School - she took art, photography and textiles - the 24-year-old started an apprenticeship at an interior design company.

Soon her YouTube channel, set up in 2009, became her full-time job, with more than six million subscribers and 12 million hits on her vlogs per month.

Miss Sugg now charges £20,000 a month to advertisers who want to place products alongside her fashion tips.

Such is the power of the posts of Wiltshire-born Zoe that skincare brands such as Simple and fashion labels including Topshop are queueing up to work with her. 

She has created a range of beauty products, published a bestselling novel, been signed by Radio 1, is the charity Mind’s digital ambassador and was selected, along with brother Joe and boyfriend Alfie, to take part in Bob Geldof’s re-release of the Band Aid single.

Penguin Random House, the publisher behind her book Girl Online, agreed to sign Zoella after its CEO Tom Weldon was told by his 13-year-old goddaughter that the book would be ‘a huge best-seller’. 

Tomorrow night the YouTube sensation will star on the BBC's Comic Relief Bake Off special.

She will appear alongside celebrity contestants Gok Wan, Jonathan Ross and Abbey Clancy. 

Instead of beauty advice she will be challenged to bake cupcakes for the Red Nose TV show presented by show stalwarts Mary Berry and Paul Hollywood.

The youngest contestant by some distance said: 'I was genuinely a little bit shocked and very excited when I was asked to take part.'
