London has received more visitors than ever before in its history, thanks to a bumper year for tourism.

Newly-released statistics confirm the capital welcomed a record 16.8 million visitors in 2013, more than a million extra tourists than the previous record-breaking year in 2006.

And tourists are certainly splashing the cash, spending £11.2 billion on shopping, hotels, restaurants and visitor attractions - more than £1 billion more than was spent in 2012.

London calling: The capital welcome nearly 17 million visitors for the first time in its history

According to figures released today by 
the Office for National Statistics’ International Passenger Survey, Americans are our biggest fans, making up the majority of visitors to the city, followed closely by the French.

Mayor Boris Johnson welcomed the news, saying: 'These record-breaking figures are a 
tribute to the outstanding mix of culture, art, music and sport to be 
found here and more is planned. 

'With major international sporting events
 including the Rugby World Cup and the Tour de France and spectacular 
exhibitions at the Tate and the British Museum this year, it is clear 
that this wonderful city will not rest on its laurels.'

Some of the major cultural events this year will be ‘Ming: 50 Years that changed China’ at the British Museum, ‘Constable: The Making of a Master’ at the V&A and ‘Rembrandt: The Final Years’ at the National Gallery.
