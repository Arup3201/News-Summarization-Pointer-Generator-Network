A former English National  Ballet dancer who tricked dozens of children into believing they could perform at the Olympics had 'dashed more hopes than Simon Cowell', a judge said yesterday.

Stephen Moonesamy, who boasted he had a letter of endorsement from Princess Diana's brother Earl Spencer, was jailed for fraud after pretending he was an official scout recruiting dancers for the closing ceremony.

Moonesamy charged the children's dance schools to participate in his scheme, and sought further sponsorship via his website.

He selected 75 youngsters aged nine to
19 and subjected them to a pointless six-week training programme, 
telling them they were learning the routine for  the ceremony.

Meanwhile, Olympics organisers had become suspicious and alerted the police.

Moonesamy, who trained with the Royal 
Ballet and toured with the English National Ballet, admitted eight 
charges of fraud and was sentenced to two years in jail. Northampton 
Crown Court heard how he used forged documents to convince three dance 
schools he was a genuine scout.

Tricked: The children were fooled into believing they would be performing at the closing ceremony of the London 2012 Games

Earl Spencer, the brother of the late Princess Diana, agreed to write a letter of congratulations to the dancers

He charged the Dance Factory in 
Kettering, the Kilburn School  of Dance in Wellingborough and the Sinead
Loughnane Academy in Northampton £625 each. The 75 selected children 
were charged £60 each to take part by their schools.

The court heard how one teenager, 
Nicolletta Cremona, 16, cancelled an operation so that she would be free
to perform and a ten-year-old girl turned down a national gymnastics 
competition.

His fundraising drive was helped  by 
radio and television appearances and a letter of congratulations to the 
children from Earl Spencer.

Steven Evans, defending, insisted 
Moonesamy had been 'trying to make it happen' and that performing had 
been a possibility because he had contact with the closing ceremony.

But Judge Sylvia De Bertodano said Moonesamy had 'dashed more hopes than Simon Cowell'.

Sentencing him, she branded the dancer 'cruel and callous' for misleading the children.

She added: 'I accept money was not 
your motivation and I accept you really did want to be involved in the 
Olympic closing ceremony.

'But it was a fantasy built on lies. It's hard to imagine anything  further removed from the Olympic spirit.'

A spokesman for Locog, the organising 
committee of the Games, said it would be looking into providing a 
goodwill gesture for the children.
