Neighbours have told how they were woken in the middle of the night by Alex Reid attempting to force his way in to the Essex home he shares with Chantelle Houghton.

The 37-year-old cage fighter was arrested on suspicion of causing criminal damage at the property in the early hours of yesterday morning (Wednesday) after local residents awoke to a 'screaming' commotion between the pair.

One told the Daily Star: 'I could hear a man shouting and when I looked out I saw Alex Reid.

Released without charge: Police have decided to take no further action after being called to the Essex home Alex Reid shares with Chantelle Houghton in the early hours of yesterday morning

'He was screaming, "Let me in, f***ing let me in.’ Other people living in the street must have woken up because I saw a few lights go on".'

Meanwhile, another neighbour near the couple's home in Brentwood, Essex, admitted to finding the incident 'quite frightening'.

She added: 'I’m used to them making noise late at night but I only usually hear cars coming back and forth and sometimes a bit of loud talking.

'This time I heard banging and lots of shouting. I live on my own so it was quite frightening.'

No comment: Alex Reid posted a statement about the incident on his official website

Alex has since been released by Essex Police without charge.

In a statement on his official website, he said: 'In the early hours of this morning Alex was arrested at the address he shares with his partner, Chantelle Houghton after she called police following a disturbance.

'The reasons for Alex’s arrest have been widely publicised and in some cases inaccurate and based on conjecture.

'Alex considers this a private matter and therefore is not prepared to comment on it save to say that he assisted police with their inquiries and following that, the police have taken no further action.'

Questions: Police were spotted leaving Alex and Chantelle's Essex home yesterday afternoon (Wednesday)

Police arrested the reality star at 1.30am yesterday morning 'on suspicion of criminal damage and using violence to secure entry'.

A spokesperson for Essex Police told MailOnline: 'Police were contacted just before 1.30am this morning with reports of a disturbance at a property in Spital Lane, Brentwood.

'A 37-year old man from Brentwood was arrested on suspicion of criminal damage and using violence to secure entry, and is currently in police custody.'

In recent weeks, the couple have made no secret of the fact their relationship has been under strain following the birth of their 11-week-old daughter, Dolly, in June.

Chantelle told the new issue of OK! magazine: 'Things have been really strained. There's never a day without drama.'

Testing times: Chantelle and Alex have made no secret of the fact that their 16-month relationship is somewhat turbulent at present

In an interview with New! magazine this week, Alex admitted he had made mistakes in his relationship with Chantelle:

He said: 'I’m doing everything in my power to make it work. I’ve made bad mistakes and choices.'

The couple have been dating for 16 months, and have run into several problems throughout the course of their relationship.

Chantelle was furious when she discovered Alex had been exchanging private, but innocent, Twitter messages with model Amy Willerton - former protogee of his ex-wife Katie Price.

The former Paris Hilton lookalike also admitted she has also been upset by Alex being groped by a drag queen as he performed in a gay club.

A few weeks before baby Dolly was born, Alex briefly moved out of the couple's Essex home, and again left the property for three days last month.
