Prince Harry returned to Afghanistan today on behalf of the Queen as he led emotional tributes to his friends who died in the name of war.

It was a highly meaningful return for the Prince, who was posted to the country on a tour of duty in 2007-08 and again in 2012-13.

The 30-year-old left a personal wreath at Kandahar Airfield which read: 'There is no greater love than to lay down one's life for one's friends. They will never be forgotten. Harry.'

'They will never be forgotten': Prince Harry lays a wreath at Kandahar Airfield in Afghanistan today, where he led a service for the Queen

Emotive: The highly personal message on the Prince's wreath, which was left as part of the service. He served alongside other soldiers during his secret first deployment to Afghanistan in 2007-08, then again when he returned to the country in 2012-13

Tribute: The 30-year-old also read from John 15 in the Bible, the passage from which he took the quote on his poppy wreath

Salute: Today's visit came just weeks after it was revealed British combat operations had come to an end after 13 years of conflict

The quote came from John 15:13, a Bible passage which Harry read as part of a Remembrance Sunday service at the dwindling base where he also met colleagues from his former unit.

The full quote comes as Jesus addresses his disciples, and reads: 'My command is this: Love each other as I have loved you. Greater love has no one than this: to lay down one’s life for one’s friends.

'You are my friends if you do what I command. I no longer call you servants, because a servant does not know his master’s business. Instead, I have called you friends, for everything that I learned from my Father I have made known to you.'

It was believed to be the Prince's first return to Afghanistan since his operational role came to an end in January 2013.

The Ministry of Defence confirmed Harry's role this afternoon - only after he had safely left Kandahar - after he was notably absent from the Remembrance Sunday commemorations in Whitehall which included his brother.

There are just a few hundred remaining troops in Afghanistan, where their combat role officially came to an end on October 26.

Harry served in Afghanistan twice, but his maiden deployment had to be cut short after a foreign publication broke a strict media blackout on details of his whereabouts.

The Prince lined up with fellow servicemen to hear The Last Post and Reveille played by musicians from the Royal Artillery Band.

Combat: The first return since January 2013 was an opportunity for the Prince to be reunited with some of his old colleagues

Flying visit: Pilots showed the Prince inside the cockpit of an RAF Tornado on his brief trip to Kandahar Airfield this morning

For security reasons the visit remained under a media blackout until the Prince left, much like his first deployment in 2007-08

After the service he met personnel from Joint Force Support (Afghanistan) and 904 Expeditionary Air Wing, including members of 31 Squadron RAF serving their final tour of Afghanistan.

He climbed into the cockpit of a Tornado GR4 and learned how the jet has served in recent operations, a Ministry of Defence Spokesman said. 

The Prince, whose second deployment was as an Apache helicopter co-pilot and gunner, was the first royal to see active combat since his uncle the Duke of York fought in the Falklands.

Since his two tours of duty the Prince, a captain with the Blues and Royals since 2011, has quit the Army Air Corps for a desk job organising events including the Invictus games for wounded servicemen.

A royal spokesman said: 'Prince Harry was honoured to be able to attend the last remembrance service in southern Afghanistan, especially given his personal experience of operational service.

'He felt it important to mark this significant milestone, remembering all those who have lost their lives during the campaign.' 

There was a sombre atmosphere today as the remaining troops in Afghanistan remembered the 13-year fight which has claimed more than 450 British lives.

International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) personnel and civilians gathered for remembrance services in Kabul and Kandahar - likely to be the last involving British military based in Afghanistan.

The ceremony in Camp Souter Kabul today was led by the Reverend Dr Jim Francis CF and attended by personnel from all three services, along with senior representatives from the international coalition.

Camp Bastion in Helmand is due to close in a few weeks and the final British troops are due to be pulled out of Afghanistan by the end of the year.

Warm welcome: The Prince arrived basked in golden morning sunshine as he arrived in secret in the mountainous terrain of Kandahar

The Prince arrived on an RAF C-17 transporter plane as part of the commemorations in Afghanistan, where 453 Brits have died

One among many: Harry joined other soldiers in falling silent today to pay tribute to all those who have died in armed conflict

Light relief: Despite the briefness of the visit there was still time to share a joke with other soldiers at the base in southern Afghanistan

Laughs: The Prince met soldiers before being flown back out of the base in secret. His role was only revealed once he had left

Commander Joint Force Support (Afghanistan), Brigadier Darrell Amison, said: 'We will forever be in debt to all those who made the ultimate sacrifice. We will never forget their extraordinary courage and dedication, and our thoughts will always remain with the families and friends of those we have lost.

'The final Remembrance Sunday ceremony in southern Afghanistan has significant poignancy as we pay tribute to the 453 men and women who have given their lives since 2001, along with the many hundreds who have suffered life changing injuries.

'We are incredibly proud of what they have achieved. Thanks to their sacrifice, Afghanistan is a better country and we walk in safer streets at home in the UK.' 

Since last year's Remembrance Sunday, seven members of the British armed forces have died on operations.

LCpl Oliver Thomas, Cpl James Walters, Warrant Officer Spencer Faulkner, Flt Lt Rakesh Chauhan, Capt Thomas Clarke, Sapper Adam Moralee and Capt Richard Holloway all died in Afghanistan - five of them in a single helicopter crash in April.

The youngest, 32 Engineers Regiment Sapper Moralee, from Newcastle, was just 23.

Speaking after today's service in Kabul, Brigadier James Stopford said: 'Our annual remembrance commemorations are always moments of deep reflection as we honour those who have fallen in conflict across the ages.

'This year is particularly poignant as we mark the centenary of the Great War.

'For those of us serving here in Afghanistan on operations, we remember with enormous pride the terrible sacrifice by our UK Armed Forces colleagues and those of our coalition partners, and in particular the very brave members of the Afghan security forces.

'Our shared sacrifice has made a significant difference to this country and ours and continues to do so - we will remember them.' 

Solemn: Troops at Kandahar Air Base today. The 13-year conflict claimed 453 British lives and those of many thousands more civilians

Those who remain: The few British troops left in Afghanistan are there to offer support to Afghan forces in their effort to keep the peace
