Controversial ‘Frankenfood’ crops could be grown in British fields from next year after the European Parliament yesterday voted for a new approvals process.

The system will allow each country to decide for itself whether or not to grow a GM crop – once it has been ruled safe by EFSA, which is the EU’s food safety body.

Most of Europe, including Germany and France, wants to ban the crops amid concerns over their impact on the environment, food and human health.

However, the governments of Britain and Spain support the technology and are keen to see the crops in the fields and on dinner plates as soon as possible.

The Conservatives, Labour and Lib-Dems in Westminster all support the growing of GM crops, despite widespread public opposition.

By contrast, the administrations in Scotland, Wales and many local councils oppose the technology having seen the problems that have emerged in the United States.

There, superweeds have developed that are difficult to control, leading to the need for ever more powerful chemical weedkillers, while important species like the Monarch butterfly are under threat.

Critics fear that pollen from GM plants will spread to other conventional and organic crops, as well as honey, so polluting the entire food chain.

The first GM crops to be grown here could be varieties of corn or maize created by the labs of Syngenta and Monsanto, which are modified to give them protection from the weedkiller glyphosate, also known as RoundUp Ready.

The idea is that these crops can be blanket sprayed with the chemical which will kills off any weeds but allows the corn to grow.

Once a GM crop is approved by the EU and UK government as safe, any farmer in England will be allowed to grow it, regardless of any objections from people in the area.

The only restrictions will surround the need to minimise the spread of pollen from the crop to neighbouring farms.

This will involve setting official ‘separation distances’ between the GM and other crops, which will differ depending on the plants involved.

The government has not decided what these separation distances should be. Any farmer where pollen does spread to pollute crops belonging to another person is at risk of being sued for the resulting loss in value.

An organic farmer whose crop became contaminated may find it loses its status and value if contaminated with GM genes.

Advocates claim that – in the future – GM technology could ‘feed the world’ by allowing crops to be grown in areas of drought or create plants that are high in beneficial nutrients.

Professor Johnjoe McFadden, professor of molecular genetics at the University of Surrey, welcomed the decision by MEPS, saying it would speed the commercial cultivation of GM crops.

He said: ‘Devolving decisions down to national level will allow each country to make up their own mind and thereby free up GM technology from the pressure of intense anti-GM lobbying at the centre of the EU.

‘Farmers and consumers across the EU will be more accepting of GM technology when they can see its benefits across their borders.’

Friends of the Earth campaigner Clare Oxborrow said the new rules ‘could open the door to GM crops being grown in England’.

She said: ‘Successive UK Governments have consistently championed GM crops and food - despite the fact that this technology has been hugely over-hyped and delivered little.’

Keith Taylor, Green MEP for South East England who voted against the proposals, said that despite giving EU countries new powers to ban GM in their territories, the move would mean more GM crops for the UK.

‘This is because our pro-GM Government are now able to give the go-ahead to more authorisations,’ he said.

‘I remain convinced that GM organisms cause contamination of crops, are bad for our health and that small scale sustainable agriculture is the answer to solving future food shortages.’

The new arrangements are largely the work of the pro-GM campaigner and former Tory food and farming secretary, Owen Paterson, who was sacked last year. He, along with ministers from Spain, led the drive in Brussels to speed the commercial growing of GM crops.

The policy sprang out of a series of secret briefings between ministers, their civil servants and the GM industry’s Agricultural Biotechnology Council, which began in the summer of 2012.

Ministers subsequently promised incentives for investment, a strategy for biotech and, most significantly, efforts to reduce regulation and speed up GM crop approvals, which came to fruition yesterday.

Peter Melchett, policy director at the Soil Association said: ‘The EU proposal fails to require countries to ensure that any GM crops grown will not contaminate GM free farms.’

He added: ‘The commercial GM crops currently in the pipeline for Europe are not those with traits associated with "feeding the world". They are crops engineered by GM companies to be resistant to weed killers that they too have manufactured.

‘The use of these in the US has led to huge problems with resistant weeds, and an increase in the use of pesticides. Yields from GM crops are lower than non-GM, and in the US GM crops are damaging wildlife. The Monarch butterfly, one of the wonders of the world, is at threat thanks to these crops.’
