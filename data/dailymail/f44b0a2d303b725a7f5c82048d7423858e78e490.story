Feeling adventurous? If hurtling 765 feet through an acrylic tube filled with water on top of a cruise ship is your idea of fun, this epic water coaster ride could be just what you've been looking for.

Set atop the Disney Fantasy cruise liner, the 'AquaDuck' water slide spans four decks, and features jaw-dropping views of the ship and the ocean as it winds its way around and off the side.

This amazing GoPro footage footage was filmed by holidaymaker Tim Hammond while the shipped was docked at St. Thomas’ harbour in the Virgin Islands.

Tim, who went on the ride with his 14-year-old daughter, said: 'I took this video on a Disney cruise in the eastern Caribbean with my family over new years.

'Water slides are cool, especially see-through one's that jut out over the edge of a cruise ship twelve stories up. The view of St. Thomas was spectacular and the view of the top deck of the Fantasy was also spectacular.'

The ride takes just under a minute to complete and, as can be seen in the footage, looks as though you're traveling through the air as some points along way.

Other cruise liners and stunning views of the harbour can be spotted along way as the slide winds it way off the side of the ship. 

One section features a laser show as you meander through a darkened tube along the ride before you splash into a lazy river at the end of the plunge

According to Disney, the AquaDuck water coaster is the first water coaster on a Disney Cruise Line ship, and is 'first of its kind at sea'.

Just don't forget your sea legs.
