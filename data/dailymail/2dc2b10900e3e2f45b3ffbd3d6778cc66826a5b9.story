A 15-year-old girl has tried to kill herself by taking prescription drugs after a photo of her bare chest was posted on an anonymous Twitter account.

The derogatory account, @HISDHoustonHoes, targets female students at schools in the Houston Independent Schools District and refers to women as 'hoes' and 's***s', features disturbing pictures of used sanitary napkins and posts call-outs for explicit images.

As the humiliated teenager recovers in hospital, her mother has called on authorities to hunt down the cyber bullies and shut down the account.

'I don’t want them to get away with it. Throw the book at them. They need to stop,' the mother said.

Abhorrent: This anonymous Twitter account, which uses the official HISD logo, has posted explicit photos of underage girls and has more than 230 followers

It appears the girl's picture has since been removed. She had originally sent the rude image to her boyfriend, according to KHOU 11 News.

The girl's devastated mother said her daughter attempted suicide because she felt powerless against the online bullies.

'Her half-naked, her showing her upper 
body. Just couldn’t handle it anymore and she took something. She just 
wanted to end it that way,' she said on the Roula and Ryan morning show.

'They have my child’s photo on 
there. They have other children’s photos on there. She has friends they 
are on there. She is 15. They are children they are minors.

'My spunky little girl is not ever going to be the same.

'Other parents need to see what kids are doing. We all need to see or at least try and stop it. It is wrong.'

In a disturbing development, many members of the public have blamed the young girl for her situation, saying she should never have sent the selfie in the first place.

However the girl's family argue the focus should be on the people behind the derogatory Twitter account who have posted pictures of nude underage girls and bloody sanitary pads.

Disturbing: @HISDHoustonHoes retweeted this photo originally posted by user Ricky Ticky Tavi of (clockwise from left) a used sanitary pad, blood soaked underpants and blood in a toilet bowl

Call out: The troubled account administrator regularly called on followers to send in pictures of students from schools in the Houston Independent School District

Pathetic: The disturbing Twitter account posted the details of one female student and encouraged followers to reach out to her

The troubling Twitter account has more than 235 followers and uses the official HISD logo. It appears to have been created on February 3.

The account owner has repeatedly posted call-outs for more explicit photos of HISD students, or 'hoes', to upload.

'thats it for tonight but keep on Dming us the hoes you want me to put out there and ill uploaded it tomorrow (sic),' @HISDHoustonHoes wrote on February 3.

'Yall Dm me the hood rat's Hoe's S**t's Puta's yall want me to put out there '!! (sic),' said another.

HISD officials told ABC 13 they learned of the derogatory account this week and are working with police to investigate.

They are also asking anyone who knows who's behind the account to come forward.

MY Fox Houston reported in November last year that Jack Yates High School support officer, Dr. Tameca Richardson, a
 senior Houston I.S.D. administrator, was under fire for telling an 
assembly of the school's female students that some girls had been 
dressing like 'hoes'.

A spokesperson for HISD the support officer was trying to inspire better compliance with the campus dress code.
