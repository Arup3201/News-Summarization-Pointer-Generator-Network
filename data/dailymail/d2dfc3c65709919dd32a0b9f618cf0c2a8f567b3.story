The BBC edited out images that showed Dave Lee Travis molesting a 17-year-old girl during the filming of Top Of The Pops, it was claimed in court yesterday.

Footage of the presenter groping the teenager on a June 1978 episode of the music programme was ‘shrunk’ as if  to get rid of the offending scenes, a  jury was told.

As Travis introduced a novelty song by The Smurfs, with a female audience member on either side of him, he slipped his hand up one girl’s skirt and ‘had a fumble’ of her bottom, it was alleged.

The presenter then tried to force his hand into the teenager’s underwear, making her feel ‘violated’, the jury heard.

The BBC edited out images that showed Dave Lee Travis molesting a 17-year-old girl during the filming of Top Of The Pops, it was claimed in court yesterday

But
 when Top Of The Pops was broadcast later that week, the clip had been 
cut just as the sexual assault began, it was claimed.

Giving evidence 
from behind a curtain  yesterday, the alleged victim said that if 
viewers had seen all the footage it would have been ‘quite obvious’ that
 she was being sexually assaulted.

She told Southwark Crown Court that the images broke off as she began to ‘grimace’.

The
 woman’s friend, also appearing as a prosecution witness against the 
former Radio 1 DJ, told the jury that the BBC appeared to have edited 
the video deliberately to remove the attack.

She
 said: ‘It was shrunk. Seriously shrunk. When I watched it back with 
other friends it felt like just the head part of us, rather than the 
body shot that I think would have been there originally.’

In
 cross examination, defence barrister Stephen Vullo asked: ‘You are 
saying the BBC edited this video to get rid of the touching, is that 
what you thought?’

She replied: ‘That’s what  we thought.’

The
 alleged victim said she and her friend were excited when they got 
tickets to attend the recording of Top Of The Pops at the BBC  studios 
in Shepherd’s Bush, West London. During the show, they were asked by a 
floor manager if they would like to be on TV next to Travis as he 
introduced the next song – to which they agreed.

Moments later the alleged victim appeared on stage wearing an off-the-shoulder top and a ra-ra skirt, with a flower in her hair.

‘He put his arm around myself and pulled me towards him,’ the woman, now 48, told the court.

‘I suppose it looked quite good  on screen.

‘Then
 he slipped his hand down and put it up my skirt. The skirt would have 
been lifted from the back. I can only really describe it as having a 
fumble of my bottom area. I think he was obviously trying to get into my
 underwear.’

The woman 
added: ‘He was introducing the next act as if nothing was happening. 
That’s why I just couldn’t comprehend what was going on.

‘I felt really uncomfortable. I think I just stood there. I felt a sort of shock. I felt violated.

‘The camera crew and everybody else was there and I was in front of all these people – that’s what made it more uncomfortable.’

In
 court Travis, 68, wore a dark jacket and a pink tie printed with the 
word ‘blam’. He groaned and sighed on several occasions as the woman 
gave evidence – as he had done with previous witnesses.

The footage of the two girls standing on either side of the DJ was shown to the jury yesterday.

In the short clip, filmed in the break between two acts, Travis introduces a performance of novelty hit The Smurf Song.

The court heard that when the girls got off the stage, the alleged victim told her friend she had been assaulted by Travis.

The
 pair decided not to report the attack to the BBC or the police because 
they thought no one would believe them, the court heard.

Mr Vullo told the witness she appeared to be smiling in a freeze-frame of the footage.

‘You smile because you were perfectly happy to be where you were and nothing bad was happening to you,’ he said.

The woman replied: ‘A lot of photos are taken and they don’t always tell the truth. You can see from the video I’m not happy.’

Charges: Travis denies any wrongdoing and insists he has never assaulted anyone

Mr
 Vullo then asked her: ‘What you are suggesting is that there has been a
 conspiracy at the BBC in one of its biggest shows to exclude a sexual 
assault?’

She replied: ‘I’m not saying that.’

The woman’s friend also told the court that Travis had approached them earlier in the show, when they were in the audience.

‘He
 seemed to come up to approach us and I thought he was going to give us a
 cuddle or a kiss,’ she said. ‘He is not really my type. I said “help” 
to someone who was near me and he backed off. He was known as the hairy 
monster.

‘I just felt 
intimidated. At that time I had no idea whether he would have assaulted 
me, but the thought of him giving me a kiss and a cuddle wasn’t very 
nice.’

Earlier, a former 
hotel receptionist had told the court that Travis gave her a ‘bear hug’ 
and groped her bottom after she carried his suitcase to his room.

The
 DJ, whose real name is David Griffin, stayed in the Trust House Forte 
hotel in Bude, Cornwall, in the early 80s while working on the Radio 1 
roadshow programme.

Later 
the same day he allegedly returned to reception and asked the woman, who
 was 18 or 19 at the time: ‘Will I be having the pleasure of your 
company later?’ She told the court she did not reply.

Travis,
 of Mentmore, Buckinghamshire, denies 13 counts of indecent assault 
between 1976 and 2003, and one count of sexual assault in 2008.

The trial continues.

Evidence: Travis pictured arriving at court yesterday, when he was accused of assaulting a 15-year-old

A teenage hotel worker at a coastal beauty spot told the court she was 'horrified' when Travis allegedly indecently assaulted her as she checked him into his room.

The woman said she felt 'awful' as Travis began fiddling with her blouse as they took a lift to his room.

Once inside, the veteran DJ - in the North Cornwall town of Bude as part of a Radio 1 concert - allegedly began to 'envelop' her with his arms, rubbing her lower back and bottom.

She said the alleged incident lasted '15, 20, 30 seconds, but it seemed to go on forever'.

Asked by prosecutor Miranda Moore QC why she did not complain to senior managers or police, the woman said: 'I was afraid that Mr Travis was a big star and I would be laughed out of town.

'I was a naive country girl.'

The witness, giving evidence behind a grey curtain to avoid seeing the defendant at Southwark Crown Court, said she was assaulted by the disc jockey at the hotel where she worked in the 1980s, aged 18 or 19.

The woman told the court Travis first started to meddle with her clothing as they shared a lift to his room, where she was to leave his bags.

She said: 'I had a bow on my blouse and he started to twiddle with the bow.

'I felt uncomfortable. I thought, "Something's wrong with my bow - this is awful." I felt that I was in trouble because my uniform wasn't up to standard.'

After being 'relieved' to reach the room, the woman said Travis instructed her to take his bag all the way into the room, by his bed.

She said: 'He then had his arms around me, and enveloped me and gave me a massive bear hug. I was horrified, I was held very firmly.

'He carried on hugging me. He started rubbing his hands up and down my top and lower back, and then on my bum. I was in utter shock. I just didn't know how to deal with it.'

The witness said Travis released his hands, prompting her to run to the ground floor, but she spent the rest of her shift in fear that Travis would confront her later.

She told the court: 'He approached the desk. He said, "Will I be having the pleasure of your company later on?"

'I didn't answer the question. I just thought something was terribly wrong.'

Yesterday
 the court hear that a 15-year-old farmer’s daughter thought Dave Lee 
Travis was going to rape her when he attacked her at a Showaddywaddy 
concert.

The DJ said ‘I love
 big boobs’ before pulling up her bra, ‘flicking’ her nipples and 
kissing her breasts in his motorhome at the gig in 1978, it was said.

Giving
 evidence from behind a curtain, the woman – who is now 51 – said: ‘He 
put his hand up my skirt, to my thigh. I was crying, I was shouting at 
him to stop. I thought he was going to rape me.

‘I
 was a naive 15-year-old. It was my first sexual experience. I lived on a
 farm and I didn’t have many social skills. I was star-struck, I was in 
awe of him.’

The trial continues.
