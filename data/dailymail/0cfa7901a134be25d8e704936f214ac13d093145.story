Once a staunch New Yorker, Caleb Young, like many, felt disenchanted to the city he once loved so much in the aftermath of 9/11.

A singer-songwriter who got by working as a bartender, Young watched the Twin Towers collapse from the roof of his apartment building in Williamsburg, Brooklyn.

His relationship at the time also fell through.

So he packed his bags and headed home to North Florida to live with his motherhood in his childhood home, reported The New York Post.

Needing a job, his mom found a notice in the newspaper calling for dance instructors - no experience necessary.

Caleb Young, who has become known as the 'widow whisperer', now owns a dance studio in North Florida that specializes in helping widows and octogenarians jazz up their lives

He trained for a week and got the job.

Now, over 10 years later, he owns a thriving dance studio called Absolutely Ballroom and has come to be known as 'the widow whisperer'.

Why? Because Young's studio specializes in helping octogenarians feel like they're on Dancing With The Stars.

'This director calls me and [says] how when his father died, he didn’t know if his mother would survive, and then she found ballroom dance,' Young told The NY Post.

'[It turns out] she was one of my students.'

Young has two employees who help him teach more than 40 students.

Caleb Young's dance studio, Absolutely Ballroom, is the focus of a new documentary, Ballroom Confidential, which follows the lead up to a special student performance

The students, who range in age from 23 to 97, pay $70 for 50-minute one-on-one sessions, most once a week, year round.

The majority of them are older than 50 — 30 to 40 percent of whom Young estimates are widows.

'I think the reason I connect so well with these ladies is that I treat them like people,' he says.

'Some of these ladies, they can be quite intimidating when they walk in the door.

'I’ve just never been intimidated by them.'

But there’s a deeper reason Young is able to connect with these widows — and many of them don’t realize.

In 2000, Young lost his own partner of seven years, Mark Pizzelli, to cystic fibrosis.

Caleb Young, 45, left New York after 9/11 and, after a few years working as a dancer, started up his own dance studio in North Florida

'I think I was the only one who believed he wouldn’t die,' says Young.

'I think I was still at the ‘We are invincible’ stage of life.'

It is with that shared pain, and the understanding of the need to stand on your own, that Young deals with his clients.

'The majority of it is creating their own identity — not as a wife, grandmother or a great-grandmother,' says Young.

'Just being who they are.'

Young's unique story has made him the focus of a new documentary, Ballroom Confidential, which is released Friday.
