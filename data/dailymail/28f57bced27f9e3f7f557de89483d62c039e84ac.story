Wine connoisseurs might need a glass or two to get over this one.

Wine makers thinking outside the box are selling their whites and reds in aluminum cans.

While grape aficionados are likely to struggle with the 'beerification of wine', producers say the accessible packaging will attract new consumers.

Wine not? Oregon-based Union Wine Company is selling wine in an aluminum to save 40 per cent on its packaging costs

Ryan Harms founded Union Wine Company in 2005

Oregon’s Union Wine Company has put Pinot Noir and a Pinot Gris in an eight-ounce can, just like Pabst, Budweiser, or Miller Light.

Owner Ryan Harms told Fast Company the decision will save the company about 40 percent on its packaging costs compared to bottles.

But he said the main reason for the innovation was to rebrand the wine drinking experience.

'We wanted to come up with a product that embodied our company’s philosophy of making great craft wine minus all the fuss,' he said.

'There is a ‘winification' of beer trend going on and Union Wine Co. is at the forefront of a new trend, the ‘beerification’ of wine'.

'We want to be a part of those everyday 
celebrations. That is a big part of our idea of ‘bringing 
Oregon to your table,’ thus these wines are more about immediacy, and 
the can is certainly an extension of that thinking.'

The cans will be released next year for about $5 each.

Classy: Australians Steve Barics and Greg Stokes invented Barokes Canned Wine after 'a narrowly-avoided shattered-glass-meets-jacuzzi episode'

While the concept is relatively in the U.S., Australian producers Steve Barics and Greg Stokes  began selling their wine in cans three years ago.

'After a narrowly-avoided 
shattered-glass-meets-jacuzzi episode', the men decided ready-to-drink recyclable cabs was the way of the future.

The Barokes cans, featuring a patented design with a ceramic lining that prevents the wine from making contact with the aluminum, holds the equivalent of two wine glasses, according to L.A. Weekly.

And last year, The Sparkling Collection, sold in cans under the Hardys, Banrock Station and Stone’s brands.

'We are passionate about innovation, and with the launch of these new cans from some of our most recognisable brands, we are spearheading the creation of a new category which will open wine up to new consumers, with new occasions,' Clare Griffiths, European marketing director for Accolade Wines, told The Drinks Business.
