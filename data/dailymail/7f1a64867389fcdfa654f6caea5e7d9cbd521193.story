Former South African president Nelson Mandela's condition has improved, although he remains critically ill, the government has announced.

President Jacob Zuma's office said that Mr Mandela is 'still in a critical condition in hospital but shows sustained improvement'.

Mr Zuma gave the update after visiting Mr Mandela at the Pretoria hospital where he is receiving ongoing treatment.Â

During the visit, he told the anti-apartheid leader of the love and support of all South Africans that was displayed at the leader's 95th birthday celebrations on July 18.

The president also asked the nation to continue to keep Mr Mandela in its thoughts and prayers.

Mr Mandela, who was jailed for 27 years during white minority rule, was hospitalised on June 8 for a recurring lung infection.

On his birthday, well-wishers celebrated
 with worldwide tributes dedicated to him on a day declared by the UN as
 the Nelson Mandela International Day.

It became a very poignant day for South Africans, as Mr Mandela's health tentatively continues to recover.

President Jacob Zuma visited Mr Mandela at the hospital and said he was making steady progress. 'I was able to say "Happy Birthday" to him and he was able to smile,' he told reporters.

His former wife Winnie Madikizela-Mandela called the 95th birthday 'a gift to the nation'.

Across South Africa, office workers, students, soldiers and ordinary citizens marked Mandela Day by performing community service to honour him, including sprucing up orphanages, painting walls at schools and delivering food to the poor.

Ethiopian and Nigerian asylum seekers
 who had settled in South Africa fleeing persecution and conflict in 
their own countries cleaned streets in Johannesburg to pay tribute to a 
figure widely praised as 'a father of Africa'.

Many offered birthday wishes outside the Pretoria hospital where Mr Mandela has been receiving treatment, singing songs and holding up signs wishing him a speedy recovery.

Over in the U.S. his birthday was celebrated with speeches from figures such as former U.S. President Bill Clinton.

The day was also marked in nearly 20 U.S. cities with ceremonies around Capitol Hill in Washington and volunteers handing out South African oranges in New York.

Mr Mandela became a pivotal figure in the country's democracy after his victory in the first multiracial elections in 1994 put an end to the apartheid system.

Four years earlier, he was released from 27 years spent in prison under white minority rule, 18 of them at the notorious Robben Island penal colony.
