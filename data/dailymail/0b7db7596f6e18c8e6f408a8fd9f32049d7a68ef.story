The devastated grandparents of April Jones have said ‘jail is too good’ for Mark Bridger.

Paedophile Bridger was last week handed a full life term and told he will die behind bars.

But in an emotional interview Dai and Linda Smith said they still feel justice has not been done.

Mr Smith, stepfather of April’s father Paul, advocated the used of capital punishment for child  murderers and suggested those convicted of the crime should be made to ‘suffer’.

He said: ‘Jail is too good for them. I think they should bring back hanging or the injection or something like that. But I think they should suffer first… like April had to suffer.’

His wife Linda added: ‘There’s no justice they can give him that will ever bring April back – there’s nothing they can do that will ever compensate for taking her life away.

‘I don’t think we’ll ever come to terms with it. It’s like a dream.’

Local MP Glyn Davies, a long-term opponent of capital punishment, last night admitted the five-year-old’s murder had tested his beliefs ‘like never before’.

He said: ‘I accept the logical next step is to admit he should go to the gallows and it’s not difficult justifying that.

‘In fact, it’s probably the view most people around here hold.’

The 69-year-old, father-of-four added: ‘My dilemma is that I’ve never been so close to this terrible sort of thing happening before – especially in this community.

‘Now we’ve all been touched by Bridger’s wickedness which,  inevitably, makes us re-think our views on capital punishment and about how such a crime must never be allowed to happen again and look closely at what steps can be taken to hopefully stop it.

‘Part of that process is giving serious thought to whether hanging is the deterrent. After what’s happened to April, I simply don’t know any more.

‘In the past I never thought it was either a proper deterrent or punishment. Now, like many others, I simply don’t know the right answers any more.

‘It’s a scenario I’ll now have to give a great deal of serious thought to and re-address.’

‘Such a crime must never be allowed to happen again.’

The heartbroken parents of April Jones have suffered a setback to their wish of seeing Mark Bridger’s ‘toxic’ house demolished and turned into a memorial garden.

Coral and Paul Jones want the three-bedroom, whitewashed Mount Pleasant cottage knocked down but police say it must stay untouched, in case Bridger launches an appeal.

The £150,000 property is owned by Mark Ford, who rented it to Bridger for £450-a-month.

A family friend said: ‘The cottage is a constant reminder of what happened to April. Coral and Paul would like to see it knocked down and most people in Machynlleth want to see it go too.

‘Everyone shudders every time they pass the place – it should be taken down brick by brick.’

A trail of April’s blood was found leading into the bathroom where blood was found on the door, tiles, shower curtain and inside a washing machine.

Another trail led into the  lounge and towards Bridger’s fireplace, where a burnt boning knife and traces of a child’s skull were discovered.

Demolished: Other notorious addresses such as 25 Cromwell Street, the home of Fred and Rosemary West, have been knocked down

Blood had soaked through the carpet in front of the fireplace with traces also found on the concrete underneath.

Bridger spent hours in the house drinking vodka and looking at indecent images of children.

In the past other notorious horror houses such as Fred West’s home at 25 Cromwell Street, Gloucester, have been demolished.

A police spokesman said: ‘It has to be retained as a crime scene pending an appeal.

‘The owner is insistent he does not want to make any comment about the property whatsoever at this stage.’
