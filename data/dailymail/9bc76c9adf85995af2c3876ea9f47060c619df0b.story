Alzheimer's disease could be diagnosed earlier after scientists pinpointed where it startsÂ  in the brain.

The discovery means patients could benefit from starting treatment sooner.

Researchers scanned the brains of 96 pensioners and tracked their health for three-and-a-half years. None had memory problems at the start of the study but 12 had developed mild Alzheimer's by the end.

By closely examining the results from 96 adults, the scientists were able to see that, while 84 of the brains remained normal, the 12 which came to develop Alzheimer's shows reduced metabolic activity in the LEC area.

The change, associated with declining memory, occurred at a time when all 12 volunteers were free of dementia. The study also showed how over time the effects of Alzheimer's spread from the LEC to other areas of the brain's cerebral cortex.

One region especially targeted was the parietal cortex, an area involved in functions including spatial orientation and navigation.

Lead researcher Professor Scott Small, director of Columbia University's Alzheimer's Disease Research Center, said: 'It has been known for years that Alzheimer's starts in a brain region known as the entorhinal cortex.

But this study is the first to show in living patients that it begins specifically in the lateral entorhinal cortex, or LEC.

'The LEC is considered to be a gateway to the hippocampus, which plays a key role in the consolidation of long-term memory, among other functions. If the LEC is affected, other aspects of the hippocampus will also be affected.'

The scientists suspect Alzheimer's spreads through a kind of 'domino effect', whereby neurons affected in the LEC reduce the ability of neurons around them to resist the change.

Two of the hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease are sticky protein deposits in the brain called beta amyloid plaques, and 'tangles' of tau protein.

A first step to accumulating beta amyloid is the production of amyloid precursor protein (APP).

'The LEC is especially vulnerable to Alzheimer's because it normally accumulates tau, which sensitises the LEC to the accumulation of APP,' said co-author Professor Karen Duff.

'Together, these two proteins damage neurons in the LEC, setting the stage for Alzheimer's.'

Tests on mice confirmed that the same changes in the LEC seen in the volunteers were associated with raised tau and APP.

The researchers used a high-resolution form of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to map metabolic activity in the brains of the study participants.

'Now that we've pinpointed where Alzheimer's starts, and shown that those changes are observable using fMRI, we may be able to detect Alzheimer's at its earliest preclinical stage, when the disease might be more treatable and before it spreads to other brain regions,' said Prof Small.

The new imaging method could also be used to assess potential new drug treatments at early stages of the disease, said the researchers.
