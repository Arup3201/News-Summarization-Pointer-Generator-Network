Wayne Rooney has warned Harry Kane not to let his full England debut be ruined by dirty tricks from Italy’s defenders.

England manager Roy Hodgson confirmed on Monday night that the young Tottenham star will definitely be unleashed from the start in tonight’s friendly in Turin.

Phil Jones is expected to operate in midfield as Hodgson tinkers with a team who have won seven out of seven this season, and Theo Walcott could return to the starting line-up.

All eyes will be on Kane, however, and Hodgson spoke of the ‘magic touch’ which has helped him score 30 goals this season, including his first for his country — within 79 seconds of his debut from the bench against Lithuania on Friday.

But England captain Rooney, who is set to win his 103rd cap playing at the forward tip of a midfield diamond, warned Kane what he should expect from the likes of Giorgio Chiellini and Leonardo Bonucci.

Rooney said: ‘With Italian defenders, they’re clever defenders. They do anything to try and stop you and you have to be aware of that, and not be frustrated. 

‘They’re a passionate country who love their football and they’re probably the closest in Europe to South American teams. They’ll do anything to stop you. They’re tough to play against, organised, make it as difficult to play against as possible. They’re the best in Europe at doing that.

‘Harry’s taking the ball and running at the defenders and getting shots at goal.

‘That’s all he has to do,’ insisted Rooney, who hopes to match Tommy Lawton’s record of scoring in six successive England games, set in 1938-39. ‘I’m sure if he does that the way he has, he’ll be fine.’

When Italy beat England at the World Cup in Brazil, no-one thought Kane anywhere near an international breakthrough - but he has made incredible progress.

Hodgson said: ‘It’s great to see people like Harry Kane come on the scene and it’s a fairytale for him at the moment. He’s got the magic touch. Within 80 seconds got a goal on his debut. It doesn’t get much better. This will be a tougher test, but he will start and hopefully play a large part in it.

‘Our system will be slightly different because we had a lot of forwards available for Lithuania, but we lost Raheem Sterling and Danny Welbeck, which has changed my thinking.

‘We still have what I consider to be a very offensive line-up. It’ll be hard work for the front six, who have a hard job on their hands.’

James Milner and Leighton Baines have also withdrawn.

Meanwhile, Welbeck is facing a race to be fit for Arsenal’s crunch Premier League match against Liverpool on Saturday.

He returned to north London after sustaining a knee injury in Friday’s win against Lithuania.

It is a blow for Arsenal ahead of a game which could prove pivotal in the fight for a top-four finish.
