She's the car dealer turned fashion designer who's helped transform the plus-size retail market and Gemma Collins is getting recognised for her efforts.

Romford's finest fashionista has just won the 'Editor's Choice' award at the Reveal Magazine Online Fashion Awards, where she was hailed a 'role model' for the industry.

Gemma, 32, is most certainly making waves in the fashion industry after scooping her second award in less than a year for her plus-size fashion collection - the bubbly blonde was named plus-size designer of the year, too.

Beach babe: Gemma Collins has two reasons to celebrate this week; she's just unveiled her fifth summer range and won a prestigious fashion award

Speaking about her win, Gemma said: ‘I’m so happy; it’s such an honour to be recognised for my collection. 

'I designed the range to allow curvy girls to look gorgeous and show their individuality, plus-size doesn’t need to mean hiding under baggy or dark clothes!

'I tried to make the range so it had something in it for everyone’.

Summer's coming: As the weather improves, Gemma has taken it upon herself to model her stylish new range of kaftans and beach cover-ups

Mouthpiece: Gemma, 32, who was hailed a 'role model' for the plus-size fashion industry has created a flattering range of summer dresses

As she models some key pieces from her fifth collection, Gemma shared 
her top tips for flattering your figure on holiday. She said: 
'Three-quarter length sleeves will flatter your figure more than long or
 short ones.

'They
 have the effect of making the body, as well as the arms, appear 
slimmer. Why? Because they stop at the slimmest part of the arm.

'As
 for dresses, wear wrap dresses or those with ruched detail. It will 
focus the attention to the centre of your body and create a more defined
 waist line,' she said.

Honoured: Gemma says she designed the range to allow curvy girls to look gorgeous and show their individuality and she couldn't be happier with her latest award

Big plans: Gemma, who models some casual pieces from her new range, says she wants her own flagship store on Oxford Street

Pretty in pink: Gemma has included on-trend pastels into her range of maxi dresses, kaftans and more glamorous evening gowns

Speaking
about her contribution to the fashion industry, she said: 'I've changed fashion. Women can get beautiful plus-size clothes thanks to me and I've opened a
lot of doors for the industry. That's why I'll be here for my 120th 
collection.'

'It's
crazy to think I was once a car dealer from Romford and now I've got 
this fashion empire. I have proven there's a massive market for 
plus-size women and my new range sort of says "Come on, girls! You're 
going to look amazing this summer",' she said.

Gemma, 
whose friends say all she ever talks about is her range, believes that 
she has the skills and knowledge required to create a fashion empire.

'You have to be big to design for plus-size women, you have to know what it feels like.

'In
 the next few years, I see myself having a flagship store on Oxford 
Street next to Topshop and there will be a Gemma Collins store in every 
town.

'I get so many people emailing me requesting me to open up in their town.'

Faiers recently, says she has changed the fashion industry
