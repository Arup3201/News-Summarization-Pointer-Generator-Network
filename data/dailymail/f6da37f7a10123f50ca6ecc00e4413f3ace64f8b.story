A 30-year-old professional surfer and model has been charged with attempted murder after allegedly following an elderly woman back to her apartment and running her down as part of a road rage incident.

Jill Hansen was formerly charged around 8pm on Friday in Hawaii following the attack in Waikiki, Honolulu, around noon on Wednesday, Hawaii News Now reported.

A witness, Chris Khory, has told police that he stopped Hansen from hitting the 73-year-old victim, identified as Elizabeth Conklin, a second time by smashing her back window with a crowbar.

Khory said after knocking Conklin down Hansen got out of her Volkswagen sedan, looked at her, got back in the car and reversed, according to Khon2.

According to Insurance News Net, Hansen is known in Honolulu for being a worry on the roads.

A member of the Mau­na­lani Heights Neighborhood Security Watch, who asked not to be identified, said the group alerted its members about Hansen last year after several incidents involving erratic driving and behavior.

'We needed everybody on the lookout for her - that's how scary it was,' the member said.

'All 500 members were eventually brought into the loop of this situation because it was so serious.'

'There were probably over half a dozen people that had been adversely affected by her driving.

'Two people almost run over by her, one person almost had a head-on collision with her.'

Hansen was not arrested in connection with those incidents, the member said.

According to court records, Hansen was cited three times for speeding since February, the most recent time on Sunday.

In that incident she was allegedly driving 72 mph in a 35 mph zone in Wahiawa.

She is set to appear in court for that case in June.

She was also ticketed for using a mobile electronic device while driving in July. She received a $147 fine.

In addition, in 2011 she received fines for disregarding a stop sign, driving without a license and driving without insurance.

In 2013 she was fined for driving without headlights.

She has two convictions, one for speeding and the other for driving without a license in 2010, according to the state Criminal Justice Data Center.

Besides her driving offenses, Hansen was arrested April 18 for investigation of third-degree assault. She is scheduled to appear for that case in District Court on Friday.
