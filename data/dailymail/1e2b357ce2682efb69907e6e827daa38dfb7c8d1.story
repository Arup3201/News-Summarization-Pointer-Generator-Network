Manchester United have announced that season ticket prices will be frozen for the 2015-16 campaign.

It is the fourth consecutive year that prices have remained the same, despite a summer splurge that approached £150million and United's anticipated return to the UEFA Champions League next season.

Based on information from the start of this season, the cheapest United season ticket for an adult aged between 21 and 64 is priced at £532 while the most expensive comes in at £950.

United spent big on the likes of Angel di Maria last summer but that has not led to an increase in prices

Under 16s can buy season tickets for £190 and the most expensive over 65 ticket is £380.

A club statement read: 'The club is delighted to announce that season ticket prices have been frozen for the 2015-16 season. This represents the fourth consecutive season and the fifth time in six years, that prices have been held.'

The club's executive vice-chairman Ed Woodward was writing to all current season ticket holders plus fans groups IMUSA and MUST on Friday to inform them of the freeze.

The club announced in November that revenue was down by almost 10 per cent for the first quarter of the financial year, a consequence of the failure to qualify for this season's Champions League.

However the record kit deal with adidas and a 49 per cent growth in sponsorship income means the club remains profitable and United is able to absorb the financial shortfall without resorting to raising ticket prices.
