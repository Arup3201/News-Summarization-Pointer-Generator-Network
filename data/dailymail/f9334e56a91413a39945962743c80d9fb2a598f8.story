Two women managed to escape with just minor injuries after their car plummeted 60ft off a bridge.

Driver Elizabeth Wolthoff, 25, and passenger Rebecca Winslow, 23, were in a SUV when it veered off the Route 80 bridge in Hackensack, New Jersey, and dropped into the lot below on Friday.

First responders arrived at the scene and found the pair trapped inside.

It took firefighters around 20 minutes to cut the pair free before they were taken to Hackensack University Medical Center, NJ.com reported.

They had to remove the roof and one of the doors in order to get the pair out. 

Firefighter Michael Thomasey told CBS 2: 'Everybody that saw the distance that the car fell was just taken back by the fact that they had not been injured more severely and that they were able to talk to us.

Sgt. Jeff Flynn, a State Police spokesman, said the single-car crash was reported at 7:12 a.m. on the highway's eastbound lanes.

The cause of the wreck remained under investigation, Flynn said.

Workers nearby said they saw a snow embankment with two tire tracks nearby, and feel the flare of the sun may have been to blame. 

Hackensack Fire Lt. Justin Derevyanik, who was one of the first on the scene, told CBS: 'God was watching over them today. It landed on a tree which probably padded the fall a little bit and then on a fence.'

Other officers said if the car had landed on its roof it would have been a different story.  

Cause: Authorities are trying to determine whether the weather was partially to blame for the accident
