If you love streaming sports and movies, avoid Alaska - the state with America's slowest Internet connection.

The Washington Post published this map from Broadview of average speeds for broadband throughout the United States, with Virginia in front with a speed of 13.7 megabits per second and most of the states in the northeast not far behind.

The U.S. as a whole falls behind 11 countries, losing out to South Korea, Israel and Romania.

State by state: The average Internet speeds on a state-by-state basis, with green depicting the fastest and red showing the slowest

1. Virginia     2. Delaware     3. Massachusetts     4. Rhode Island     5. D.C.     6. Washington     7. New Hampshire     8. Utah     9. Michigan     10. Connecticut     11. North Dakota

The reason for Virginia's dominance in the broadband game might be Ashburn, which Gizmodo once called 'the bullseye of America's Internet.'

This is where the hub for networks like Verizon and Facebook is located, making connection speeds in nearby areas some of the fastest available.

Washington, where Internet giant Amazon is based, also boasts significantly higher numbers than other states.

The raw numbers for the map were released in June by Akamai, a Massachusetts-based web hosting service that makes visiting the websites of Best Buy and FOX Sports possible. Red states have the slowest average connection while green stands for the fastest.

The company releases a quarterly report on the global state of the Internet, showing connection speeds and security of the web.

The good news for almost every state is that the Internet is getting faster, with Alaska improving 33% from this time last year to a chugging 7 Mbps.

This year's award for most improved goes to Kansas, who sped up 91% to 8.6 Mbps.
