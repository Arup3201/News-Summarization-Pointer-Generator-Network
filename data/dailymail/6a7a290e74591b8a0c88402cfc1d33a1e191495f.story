A father was stopped by police after they saw him talking on his mobile phone while driving - and then discovered 20kgs of high-grade heroin in the car.

Ian Hayton, of Garston, Liverpool, tried to outrun officers after they spotted him using the phone as he left a pub, ploughing through red lights, roundabouts and endangering pedestrians as he tried to evade his pursuers for five miles.

The 43-year-old, whose girlfriend was also in the Skoda Octavia, was eventually blocked by traffic and arrested.

Officers searched the vehicle and discovered the heroin, valued at Â£1million, in the boot. They also found a list of names and numbers of what are believed to be potential customers in the February 16 incident.

Stephen McNally, prosecuting, said: 'The defendant was shouting "is it just because I was on my mobile phone?".

'When the vehicle was searched it became apparent why the defendant had driven away from the police.'

The judge, Miss Recorder Goddard, initially gave Hayton 10 years in jail, but reduced the sentence because of the impact it would have on his 22-year-old son, who is severely disabled and requires extensive care, reports the Liverpool Echo.

His barrister, Michael Bagley, said Hayton's high-pressure personal life led to a descent into drink and drugs and had become involved in dealing as a result.

He added: 'Those in a leading role do not get their hands dirty. They are not the ones who actually do the moving around of drugs.

'They are the ones who exploit others and induce others into their criminal organisations by dependency, then debt, then applying pressure.'

Hayton, who admitted dangerous driving and conspiracy to supply drugs, was also banned from driving.

Detective Inspector Mark Baker, from the Matrix Serious Organised Crime team said Hayton was 'consumed by his own greed and the desire to make money'.
