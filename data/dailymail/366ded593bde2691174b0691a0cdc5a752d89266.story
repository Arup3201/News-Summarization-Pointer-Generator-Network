The founder of an app that lets Bitcoin users send the virtual currency privately has admitted he expects people will use it to buy drugs.

However, Cody Wilson added he wanted to give people ‘freedom’ to break the law if they wanted to, by using an untraceable system of payment.

He continued that he wanted Dark Wallet - a simple plug-in that sits discreetly on users’ internet browsers - to be ‘crisis-forcing’ and change the way we spend money, even if that means on narcotics.

Bitcoin transactions are recorded in a virtual public ledger, known as the blockchain. Miners are in charge of maintaining the blockchain. As their computers perform the calculations to do that, the process rewards them with newly minted bitcoins

Encrypted and difficult-to-trace pieces of code that function like cash - called Bitcoin - can be exchanged over the internet.

But current Bitcoin wallets, in a world where there are no bank accounts and are used to virtually store the coins and make transactions, can be complex.

Dark Wallet is designed to be simpler and encourage people who are not tech savvy to store and use the virtual currency.

The app and plug-in will protect a Bitcoin user's anonymity and money.

It is hoped Dark Wallet, which will work on Firefox and Chrome browsers, will accelerate the currency's rate of adoption around the world.

It will be open source and free when it launches, which is expected to be early this year.

Dark Wallet will supposedly return Bitcoin to its ‘anarchist’ roots after it became targeted by law enforcement in the U.S. for its alleged ties to criminality.

It will be an app and plug-in for the Chrome and Firefox browsers and will allow users to store, send and receive Bitcoin, only with extra security.

Dark Wallet is expected to be completed early this year and will be free to use.

Mr Wilson, a law school dropout, has become something of an internet provocateur having already posted details about a plastic gun he made with a 3D printer.

The 25-year-old also put the blueprints online so that anybody could download them, attracting attention from the FBI.

Speaking to the Wall Street Journal, Mr Wilson said: ‘We need an anonymous cash online.

‘It's not that I want you to buy drugs. It's just that I think you should have the freedom to do it.’

He added that Dark Wallet ‘captures everything we want to do’ and that ‘my particular brand of activism is crisis-forcing.’

In
 a promotional Fight Club style video posted to YouTube for Dark Wallet, Wilson says that 
‘Bitcoin is what they fear it is.’

Mr Wilson has raised $100,000 (£60,600) for the project through online donations and another $150,000 (£91,000) through other sources, with most of the money being donated in Bitcoin.

He only began focusing his attention on Dark Wallet after his plastic gun, called ‘Liberator’, was effectively banned by the U.S. State Department.

It told him to remove the blueprints from the internet as they were in breach of arms export laws.

Bitcoin’s
 security has been called into question recently after the FBI arrested 
the founder of Silk Road, which is allegedly the biggest Internet drugs 
market in the word.

Ross
 Ulbricht, 29, spent two-and-a-half years running it and supposedly made
 $28.5 million off the trades, which were carried out in Bitcoin.

He has now been charged with allegedly 
engaging in a drug trafficking, money laundering, conspiracy as well as 
computer hacking and attempted murder-for-hire.

Silk Road, which allowed users to trade in illegal drugs, required transactions to be made using the virtual currency Bitcoin

Stephen Hudak, a spokesman for the U.S. government's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, said it would be monitoring the situation.

He said: ‘We'd be concerned about anything that would increase the threat level of money laundering.’

In mid-December the Bitcoin virtual currency passed the $1,000 (£613) mark for the first time since it was introduced in 2009.

Analysts claim the demand for Bitcoin follows increased awareness about benefits of the currency and a drive to move it into the mainstream.

The digital currency is increasingly being treated like gold, with some investors using it to hedge against currency fluctuations and speculating on its rise.

Bitcoins can be bought with near anonymity, which supporters say lowers fraud risk and increases privacy.
