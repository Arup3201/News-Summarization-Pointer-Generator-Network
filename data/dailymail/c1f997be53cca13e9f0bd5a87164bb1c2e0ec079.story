Uniting: Pope Francis has said atheists who are good are redeemed by Jesus in a homily urging that people of differing beliefs work together

Pope Francis has said atheists who are good are redeemed by Jesus in a homily urging that people of differing beliefs work together.

The leader of the world's 1.2 billion Roman Catholics made his comments at the morning Mass in his residence - a daily event where he speaks without prepared comments.

He told the story of a Catholic who asked a priest if even atheists had been redeemed by Jesus.

'Even them, everyone,' the Pope answered, according to Vatican Radio. 'We all have the duty to do good,' he said.

'Just do good and we'll find a meeting point,' the Pope said in a hypothetical conversation in which someone told a priest: 'But I don't believe. I'm an atheist.'

Francis's reaching out to atheists on Wednesday and people who belong to no religion is a marked contrast to the attitude of former Pope Benedict.

He sometimes left non-Catholics feeling that he saw them as second-class believers. 

Speaking to the Huffington Post, Father James Martin explained Pope Francis' homily.

He said: 'Pope
 Francis is saying, more clearly than ever before, that Christ offered 
himself as a sacrifice for everyone....  rarely do you hear it 
said by Catholics so forcefully, and with such evident joy.

'And in this 
era of religious controversies, it's a timely reminder that God cannot 
be confined to our narrow categories.'
