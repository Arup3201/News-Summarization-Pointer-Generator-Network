Hero: Former Manchester City goalkeeper Bert Trautmann has died at the age of 89

Former Manchester City goalkeeper Bert Trautmann, who entered football folklore when he played on in the FA Cup Final with a broken neck, has died aged 89.

The German Football Association announced that Trautmann, who played more than 500 times for the Manchester club after arriving in the UK as a prisoner of war, died at his home in Spain this morning.

Trautmann, whose full name was Bernd, was best known for winning the FA Cup in 1956 despite playing the final 17 minutes of the game with a broken neck.

As well as his Wembley heroics, Trautmann was also awarded an OBE for his work promoting Anglo-German relations after World War Two.

He had survived two heart attacks this year, but died suddenly in La Llosa, near Valencia.

Confirming his death, German FA (DFB) president Wolfgang Niersbach said: 'Bert Trautmann was an amazing sportsman and a true gentleman.

'He went to England as a soldier, and thus a war enemy, and he became a celebrated hero there. He was a legend.

'His extraordinary career will remain forever in the history books.'

The world of football paid tribute to Trautmann this afternoon, with his old club describing him as a 'legend'.

A Manchester City statement read: 'Bert Trautmann, one of the greatest Manchester City goalkeepers of all time and a true Club legend, has passed away aged 89, his son has today confirmed.

'Perhaps there is no greater tribute than that of the one Lev Yashin once gave of Trautmann.

Trautmann became a hero in Manchester despite protests from around 20,000 fans when he initially signed for the club in 1949, with memories of World War Two still fresh.

But he wrote his name into the history books when he dived at the feet of Birmingham City striker Peter Murphy with 17 minutes of the 1956 cup final remaining.

The goalkeeper was knocked out cold as Murphy's knee collided with his neck and had to be revived on the pitch.

In the days before substitutes were allowed, however, Trautmann was forced to play on and managed to make two further crucial saves despite being seen staggering around his penalty area in agony.

Bert was born in October 1923 in west Bremen and joined the Jungvolk, a precursor to Hitler Youth at the age of ten.

A celebrated athlete as a youngster, he was once awarded a certificate of excellence for his sporting prowess by German president Paul von Hindenburg.

He worked as an apprentice motor mechanic before the outbreak of war in 1939 and joined the Luftwaffe, initially as a radio engineer in 1941.

He eventually transferred to Spandau to become a paratrooper and first served in occupied Poland.

Trautmann was court martialled and jailed for three months after a practical joke involving a car backfired and injured a staff sergeant but spent most of his sentence in a military hospital with appendicitis.

He was part of a German advance on Dnepropetrovsk in Ukraine in October 1941 which failed because the cold weather halted their advance.

He was promoted to corporal in the spring of 1942 and won five medals for his actions on the Eastern Front, including an Iron Cross First Class.

Trautmann was soon promoted to sergeant and was one of the few survivors of the Allied bombing of Kleve in 1944.

Trying to make his way back to Bremen with his unit decimated, he was captured by Allied soldiers.

He was initially imprisoned in Ostend in belgium, before being transferred to a POW camp in Essex, classified as a category C prisoner by authorities.

He was transferred to another camp at Marbury Hall, in Cheshire, and was downgraded to non-Nazi category B status.

He was eventually taken to a small camp in Ashton-in-Makerfield, Lancashire, where he stayed until 1948, making his name as an amateur footballer with St Helens Town.

His signing for Manchester City in October 1949, was met with anger from many supporters who threatened a season ticket boycott.

But he soon won over fans. Despite being regarded as a legend at Manchester City, Trautmann was never capped by the German national side.

He finished his playing career in 1964 with a testimonial in front of an estimated 60,000 supporters.

After his playing days, he moved into management with Stockport before returning to his native Germany in 1967 to coach Preussen Munster.
