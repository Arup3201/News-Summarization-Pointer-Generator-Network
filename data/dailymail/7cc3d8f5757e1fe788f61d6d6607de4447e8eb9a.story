The eurozone has fallen into a double dip recession, as the debt crisis even managed to slow Germany's powerhouse economy to a virtual standstill.

The 17-country bloc - which generates a fifth of global output - shrank by 0.1 per cent between July and September and by 0.2 per cent in the previous three months. Two falls in a row means a double dip recession.

And this time, Germany and France, the eurozone's biggest economies, could not save the region from a double-dip even though both their economies grew by 0.2 per cent.

The news comes a day after violence erupted in cities across Europe as protesters took to the streets in Spain, Portugal, Italy, Greece and France to demonstrate against tough government austerity measures.

The Europe-wide cuts have proved divisive with EU policymakers saying they are crucial to 
ending the debt crisis but others blame them for the economic nosedive.

Italy and Spain are in the worst state, having been contracting for a year already, while Greece is suffering an outright depression.

The good news is that while the European Commission predicts a 0.4 per cent contraction for the eurozone in the whole of 2012, it believes it will grow 0.1 per cent in 2013.

Experts hope that that growth, while small, will increase year on year.

Riot police were forced to protect the Portuguese parliament from angry protesters yesterday, while rubber bullets were fired on the streets of Madrid, and there were running battles with police in Milan and Rome, and clashes in Paris and Lille.

Meanwhile, Germany's predicament is prompting particular concern among economists, as the eurozone crisis takes an increasingly severe toll on its normally robust economy.

The signs are that after months of resilience, Europe's largest economy is seeing its companies unnerved by the crisis and demand for its goods in the eurozone and abroad dry up.

While German gross domestic product expanded by 0.5 per cent in the first quarter, it slowed to 0.3 per cent in the second and weakened again to 0.2 per cent in the third. Economists expect a worse performance in the fourth quarter.

Howard Archer, economist at 
forecaster IHS Global Insight, said the latest figures confirm that the 
eurozone is now in modest recession 'in all senses of the word'.

'In
 reality, the eurozone was already in recession in most senses of the 
word as a current record unemployment rate of 11.6 per cent would 
testify,' he said.

'Indeed,
 the third quarter of 2012 marked the third eurozone quarter-on-quarter 
GDP drop in four quarters (broken only by flat GDP in the first quarter 
of 2012) and left GDP down by 0.6 per cent year-on-year.'

Archer
 added that with the eurozone seemingly headed for further GDP 
contraction in the fourth quarter, and the underlying inflation 
situation in the region looking far from alarming, the European Central 
Bank was likely to cut interest rates from 0.75 per cent to 0.50 per 
cent sooner rather than later.

He said an interest rate cut in December was very possible.

Paul De Grauwe, an economist with the London School of Economics, said: 'We are now getting into a double dip recession which is entirely self-made.

'It is a result of excessive austerity in southern countries and unwillingness in the north to do anything else,' he said.

'Countries in the south have to 
reduce their deficits, but they cannot if those in the north with a 
surplus are not willing to help with stimulus. This divide, even 
hostility, between countries is stronger than I have seen in the last 20
 years.

'The degree of 
austerity has now put so many people in terrible conditions that they 
reject all of this. That's a very dangerous situation.'

Martin van Vliet, economist at Dutch 
bank ING, said the 0.1 per cent eurozone contraction was not a surprise 
after the German and French numbers, and it could have been worse.

'What
 you notice is that the recession in southern Europe is slowly creeping 
to other countries. Look at the Netherlands, with a strong contraction, 
and Austria, also with a small contraction. There was no contraction in 
Belgium and Finland but the second quarter was very bad.'

'If you look at the indicators for the fourth quarter you see that even Germany may not grow again.'

Meanwhile,
 France's prime minister assured a German audience on Thursday that his 
country is committed to getting its debt under control, and said that is
 essential to preserving France's sovereignty.

Jean-Marc
 Ayrault's first visit in Germany since taking office in May comes as 
concerns grow that France's economy, the eurozone's second-largest, is 
weakening just as the government has to slash spending to reduce its 
deficit. France is Berlin's most important ally in fighting Europe's 
debt crisis.

France is committed to 'stop burdening future generations with continuously rising debt and restore the necessary leeway for political actions,' Ayrault told a gathering of German business leaders.

He stressed that 'we are aware that getting the public finances in order is also the precondition for our sovereignty.'

According to official figures published Thursday, France narrowly avoided falling into recession in the third quarter. Its economy expanded 0.2 percent in the July-September period from the previous quarter - as did that of Germany, where growth is slowing.

President Francois Hollande's Socialist government has promised to rein in massive government spending and reduce the deficit, largely by raising taxes.

But the country has watched unemployment tick steadily up as a raft of companies announced layoffs in recent months. The jobless rate now stands at 10.8 percent, according to European statistics.
