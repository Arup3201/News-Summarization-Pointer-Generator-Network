Princess Stephanie of Monaco can't keep away from the circus - she spent a third night at the International Circus Festival of Monte-Carlo yesterday evening.

Wearing a smart long leather jacket, Stephanie, 49, was presented with a bunch of flowers by the a cast of clowns, who all seemed incredibly happy to see her again. 

The Princess is a huge supporter of the circus and appeared delighted to greet the colourful performers, who were decked out in their best costumes.

What a gang: Wearing a long black coat Princess Stephanie of Monaco spent her third day at the International Circus Festival of Monte-Carlo

Sealed with a kiss: Princess Stephanie was greeted by the ring master who gently kissed her hand

The Princess looked radiant on the evening, wearing her long dark hair down around her shoulders, while a lacy top peeked out from underneath her coat. 

For the second night in a row, Princess Stephanie was treated to a kiss on the hand from ringmaster Petit Gougou during the show. 

She attended the event with her youngest daughter Camille, who recently celebrated her 16th birthday.

Controversy surrounded Camille's birth in 1998 as Stephanie neglected to name a father on her birth certificate.

As such, Camille is not included in the line to the Monegasque throne, unlike her brother Louis Robert and her sister Pauline Grace. 

It was rumoured at the time that her father was Jean-Raymond Gottlieb who was Princess Stephanie's former body guard, but nothing has ever been confirmed.

Just the day before her trip with Camille, the Princess had also attended the circus for a rare night out with her brother Prince Albert of Monaco.

Beaming broadly as a spiky haired Italian clown named Fumagali approached, Prince Albert was clearly in a good mood as he enjoyed the evening.

The festival is an annual event in the principality and has been running since 1974. But while Albert and Stephanie appeared to be enjoy the show, the newest additions to Monaco's royal family were nowhere to be seen.

New mother Princess Charlene was absent, having chosen to remain at home with month-old twins, Jacques Honoré Rainier and Gabriella Thérèse Marie.

Their absence didn't prevent Prince Albert from enjoying himself, although the event did briefly take a sombre turn at the beginning of the night.

Part way through the opening ceremony, a minute's silence was held in memory of stunt rider Kevin Ferrari, a.k.a Flic Flac Moto X, 24, who was killed during an accident in rehearsals on Wednesday.

Despite his death, the show continued after the minute's silence with elephants, acrobats and clowns all on the billing. 

Royal approval: The clown, real name Giovanni Huesca, raised smiles all round

Round of applause: Albert, who was taking a night off from daddy duties, claps at the end of the performance

Welcome: New father Albert also got a round of applause of his own and waved at the crowd appreciatively

Looking good: Despite having two tiny babies to care for, Albert looked surprisingly fresh

Royal wave: Albert waves to the Monte Carlo crowd from the comfort of the royal box

Tribute: Ahead of the performance, there was a minute's silence for a performer who died earlier this week

The prince  certainly appeared to enjoy rest of the show though, gasping in delight as a daredevil stunt rider appeared and threw himself into the air from the back of his galloping horse.

At the time Stephanie, who is patron of the International Circus Festival, was making her second visit to the Big Top in a week, having already met clowns and elephant trainers on Tuesday.

During that visit, the 49-year-old, who eloped with an elephant trainer in 2000, was seen patting one of the circus' pachyderms, looking unruffled as it began waving its trunk.

The royal, who also helps to oversee the Circus Festival and is involved in everything from choosing the acts to the choreography, first attended the event when she was just nine.

Her father Prince Ranier was the brains behind the first festival, which now as then, specialises in traditional circus acts  from clowns to acrobats.
