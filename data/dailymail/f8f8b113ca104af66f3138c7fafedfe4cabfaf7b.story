The infamous nude pictures of Jackie Kennedy Onassis on a beach that caused a media storm in 1972 were part of a widespread smear campaign by her own husband, a new book reveals.

The former First Lady married Greek tycoon Aristotle 'Ari' Onassis  in 1968 after he wooed her with gifts and declarations of love.

But throughout the turbulent four-year marriage Ari pursued his not-so-secret affair with opera singer Maria Callas - while allegedly using his press contacts to publicly humiliate Jackie for stepping out of line.

Smear:  Greek tycoon Aristotle Onassis tipped off media before Jackie stripped off on a beach, a book reveals

Turbulent: He wooed the former First Lady into marriage in 1968 (pictured) but it was rocky from the start 

The revelation comes from noted Kennedy author Christopher Andersen in his upcoming book The Good Son: JFK Jr. and the Mother He Loved.

The biography about Jackie's son describes how Ari bullied his new wife - constantly deriding her as 'The Widow' during interviews, according to an excerpt published by the New York Daily News.

Anderson describes the fatal moment that crushed their relationship in 1972: tired of Jackie suing the media for invasion of prviacy, Ari gave ten photographers detailed maps and time plans of when 'The Widow' would be on the beach in Skorpios.

The nude shots splashed all over magazines and newspapers worldwide, earning Jackie the moniker 'Billion Dollar Bush', and affording her children years of cruel bullying.

'His real wife': He started pursuing Callas within weeks of marrying Jackie and kept up the liaison throughout

He then filed for divorce.

It was the final hit after years of public disputes between the couple. 

From the moment they married, he left her alone and upset for two weeks as he jetted around Europe on 'business'.

When Jackie's private letters to Roswell Gilpatric were exposed in 1970 - including one written days after their wedding - Ari publicly dined with Maria Callas in Paris, and tipped off photographers.

The last straw: He ended their marriage in 1972 after the nude images caused a global media storm

'Dearest Ros,' she had written, 'I would have told you before I left - but then everything happened so much more quickly than I'd planned. I saw somewhere what you had said and I was touched - dear Ros - I hope you know all you were and are and will ever be to me - With my love, Jackie.' 

It hurt Ari's pride and he was fully aware that the pictures of him with Callas - 'his real wife' - would be snapped up by US newspapers.

But he gleefully boasted about his own dalliances, once telling Johhny Meyer: 'Everybody here knows three things about Aristotle Onassis.

'I'm f***ing Maria Callas, I'm f***ing Jacqueline Kennedy - and I'm f***ing rich.'
