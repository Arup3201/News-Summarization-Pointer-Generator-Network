An Ohio man is sitting on a street corner with a sign declaring he's a bully as part of his sentence for harassing a neighbor and her disabled children with ethnic slurs.

A judge ordered 62-year-old Edmond Aviv to display the sign for five hours Sunday, starting at 9am, as part of a greater sentence for disorderly misconduct.

The sign says: 'I AM A BULLY! I pick on children that are disabled, and I am intolerant of those that are different from myself. My actions do not reflect an appreciation for the diverse South Euclid community that I live in.'

The Northeast Ohio Media Group reports that Aviv arrived at the corner just before 9am and the first car horn sounded as soon as he got there.

He placed the hand-lettered sign next to him as he sat in a chair.

Not impressed: Edmond Aviv seems to recoil as he serves out his sentence on Sunday

Aviv called his neighbor 'Monkey Mama' as she held her adopted, disabled African-American children, and smeared dog feces on their wheelchair ramp

Municipal court judge
 Gayle Williams-Byers said Aviv, of South Euclid, must hold the sign 
until 2pm, in a sentence that has garnered international attention.

Aviv also must serve 15 days in jail, seven months probaation and undergo anger management classes and counseling.

Court
 records say Aviv has feuded with his neighbor, Mike Prugh, and his 
adopted children for 15 years.

He pleaded no contest to a 
misdemeanor charge of disorderly conduct.

'I
 would hope that's what's been achieved here is finally the modicum of 
justice that they had been hoping for for quite some time,' said 
Williams-Byers.

The 
Plain Dealer newspaper in Cleveland reports that the neighbor says Aviv 
has called Prugh's adopted daughter an ethnic slur, spat on her and smeared feces on the family's wheelchair ramp.

'You wonder every time you walk outside, you turn to your left to see if your neighbor is there spitting, yelling, screaming at you and you don't know why,"' said Prugh.

Aviv offered his 'sincere apology' in a court-ordered apology letter.

'Move on with your life, hopefully they can move on with their lives, and we can live in peace,' said Prugh.

WKYC reports that South Euclid Councilwoman Ruth Gray wants to know why prosecutors didn't bring harsher charges against Aviv.

'I'm disturbed. I think that we as a community need to ask some questions,' said Gray.

If Aviv doesn't stop harassing his neighbors he will go back to jail.
