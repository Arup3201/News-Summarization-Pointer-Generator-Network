The late Casey Kasem's lavish Beverly Hills mansion has been put up for sale by his widow Jean at a price of $42 million.

The legendary broadcaster died on Sunday, aged 82, after a long battle with dementia and Parkinson's disease amid a bitter family feud over his medical care.

Kasem's second wife Jean has placed the 12,000 square-foot property, which comes with a piece of the Brooklyn Bridge, a par-three golf course and a heart shaped pool up for grabs at a hefty price of $42 million.

The property is located in Beverly Hills, California, where its new owner will become a neighbour to such stars as Charlie Sheen, Taylor Swift and Sharon Stone

The property includes a swimming pool to cool off in after a few rounds of tennis and can accommodate plenty of people using its eight bedrooms and 14 bathrooms

The 
American DJ was best known for his voice acting of the cartoon character
 Shaggy from the Scooby-Doo franchise and hosting the radio show 
'American Top 40'.

His
distinctive voice could also be heard in many commercials, Sesame
 Street and many of the Transformers cartoons of the 80s.

The
 massive property, which is up for grabs at a price of $42 million, 
features a huge garden with a roundabout at the end of the driveway, a par-three golf course, tennis courts, a heart-shaped pool, butler's 
pantry, eight bedrooms and 14 bathrooms.

Kasem's
 sprawling mansion sits nestled among other properties in the city of 
Beverly Hills, California, which is renowned for its rock star and 
celebrity residents. The new owner will be rubbing shoulders with the 
likes of Hollywood actors Charlie Sheen, Sharon Stone and Mark Wahlberg 
and pop-star Taylor Swift.

Kasem died on Sunday aged 82. As well as a lifetime spent hosting radio shows, he also voiced the character of Shaggy from the Scooby-Doo franchise

Jean Kasem is herself no stranger to luxury - she owns a stunning cliff top apartment in Malibu, California.

The apartment at Holiday House has one bedroom, more than one bathroom and sits in a complex with a private pool and beach access.

Despite the acrimony between Kasem's widow and her children in recent months, the ugly feud has been put on hold as his 41-year-old daughter Kerri agreed that widow Jean could claim his body.

It comes amid new allegations from Kerri, referenced in court documents filed by her lawyer, that her stepmother was cheating on her father with a much younger man as he lay on his deathbed.

'Jean has a boyfriend and Kerri believes their affair has been going on for at least two years,' Kerri’s private investigator, Logan Clarke, told the MailOnline in an exclusive interview.

'Jean has even moved him into the oceanfront condo she owns in Malibu.'

In recent months she has been locked in bitter feud with Kasem's children over her late husband's medical care, but this has been temporarily put on hold

In 2013, Kasem's children filed a legal petition to gain control of his health care, alleging that Kasem was suffering from advanced Parkinson's disease and his wife was isolating him from friends and family members. Kasem also suffered from Lewy Body Disease, a form of dementia.

A judge in May temporarily stripped his wife of her caretaker role after she moved him from a medical facility in Los Angeles to a friend's home in Washington state. She said she moved her husband to protect his privacy and to consult with doctors. Casey Kasem developed a severe bedsore while in Washington and was in critical condition by the time he was hospitalized in early June.
