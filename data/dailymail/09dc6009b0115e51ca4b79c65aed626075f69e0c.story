A group of friends and their children who are living together in a nine-bedroom home in Connecticut could be forced out because they aren't all related.

The three couples, their three children and two single friends face being separated because the city of Hartford says the living arrangement violates its historic district's zoning code, which says that no more than two unrelated people can live in one of its homes, CBS reported.

But the group, who moved into the spacious home in the West End neighborhood last August, said they believe they are promoting great values.

'Family': Three couples, three of their children and two single friends  bought a home together in Hartford, Connecticut last year but now face having to sell because the arrangement violates zoning laws

Spacious: They moved into this nine-bedroom home together last August and they said the arrangment is allowing them to live within their means while also making them cooperate like a family should

'I think there's a real extension of our values as people,'  one of the group's members, English teacher Kevin Lamkins, told CBS.

'The values I'm speaking of are sustainability, cooperation, living more, living well but within your means. Being connected to other people and not being in a silo, so to speak.'

The group, which contains three teachers and a mental health therapist, laughed as they explained there are no religious undertones to the arrangement or 'intermingling' of couples.

Instead, they share duties in the home and they share a bank account to pay expenses.

But last year, a neighbor complained to the city, which determined they were violating the zoning code, which was historically set up to avoid people turning their homes in the beautiful district into boarding houses.

All together: The residents, who laughed as they said they were not a cult, share responsibility for chores

Working as one: The group members showed CBS This Morning how they list projects needed to be carried out at the house; everyone chips into the cost of repairs on the home, they said

The group appealed but lost and now have to decide on if they should go to court or go their different ways. They said the thought of having to separate is financially and emotionally stressful.

'It's preposterous. Whomever is in your home, who you love, is who your family is,' Josh Blanchfield told CBS. 'And the notion that the city is going to discount that is unacceptable to us.' 

City officials would not comment, citing possible litigation.

The beautiful, historic neighborhood is home to high-profile residents including Mayor Pedro Segarra and his husband and Connecticut Governor Daniel Malloy.

Online listings show the home sold last summer for around $450,000 while other property prices in the area reach into the millions.
