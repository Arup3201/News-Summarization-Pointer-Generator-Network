A new 3D computer simulator has been designed to help doctors and midwives prepare for unusual or potentially dangerous births.

The programme creates a model of the inside of a woman’s body that can simulate the act of giving birth.

It takes important factors into account that can help predict how easily a baby will be delivered, including the shape of the mother’s body and the position of the baby.

Computer scientists are creating a virtual birthing simulator that creates a view of the inside of a woman¿s body that can simulate the act of giving birth (pictured). They said it can give 'patient-specific birth predictions' that will help doctors and midwives deliver babies more safely

Computer scientists at the University of East Anglia, who invented the programme, said it will provide ‘patient-specific birth predictions'.

Speaking at the International Conference on E-Health and Bioengineering in Romania, Dr Rudy Lapeer, who has led the project, said: ‘We are creating a forward engineered simulation of childbirth using 3D graphics to simulate the sequence of movements as a baby descends through the pelvis during labour.

‘Users will be able to input key anatomical data, such as the size and shape of the mother’s pelvis and the baby’s head and torso.

‘By doing this you will be able to set different bespoke scenarios for both the mother and baby,’ he said.

The simulation software will see ultrasound data used to re-create a geometric model of a baby’s skull and body in 3D graphics as well as the mother’s body and pelvis. 

Programmers are also taking into account 
the force from the mother pushing during labour and are even modelling a
 ‘virtual’ midwife’s hands that can interact with the baby’s head.

Dr Lapeer said: ‘Because this programme is patient-specific, doctors and midwives will be able to see how a birth may take place before it has happened on a case-by-case basis. For example, you would be able to see if a baby’s shoulders will get stuck.

‘We hope that this could help to avoid complicated births altogether by guiding people in the medical profession to advise on caesarean sections where necessary.’

The computer programme can currently run through scenarios based on previous births as well as modelling the physics of childbirth in unfamiliar birth scenarios, according to LiveScience.

The simulator can be used to train midwives, who currently learn by watching videos of births or using mannequins, neither of which show how a baby moves inside its mother.

While the programme currently models one baby and pelvis, it does not recreate the movements of a foetus, or the movements of the muscles of the mother’s pelvis but the researchers hope to build on their innovation so that it can handle additional factors.
