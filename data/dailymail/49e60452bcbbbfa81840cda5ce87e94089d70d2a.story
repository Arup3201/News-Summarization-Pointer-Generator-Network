David Cameron today admitted he need to swot up on his history homework after being caught out on US television.

The Prime Minister – in New York for a United Nations meeting – was tripped up by a general knowledge quiz on on David Letterman’s Late Show last night.

After getting the composer of Rule Britannia wrong and being unable to translate Magna Carta, Mr Cameron confessed: 'I’m a history obsessive, so I’m sorry I didn’t do better.'

Making a point: After an apparently warm welcome, David Cameron is grilled by U.S chat show king David Letterman on British history, which left him squirming in his seat

Whoops: Mr Cameron was asked who composed Rule Britannia, to which he wrongly replied Edward Elgar

Asked today how he rated his performance on 
the Letterman show, Mr Cameron added: 'I think, when I get home and do my children’s homework, maybe I need to sit down and do a little bit extra myself.'

It had all started so well. The house 
band played Rule Britannia as he walked on stage and dry ice was pumped
into the studio to replicate a London fog.

But
the apparently warm welcome quickly turned into a trap as Mr Letterman,
famed for his acerbic wit, tested Mr Cameron with questions on British 
history.

Asked who composed Rule Britannia, Mr Cameron replied: ‘You are testing me there. Elgar, I will go for.’

In fact, as Mr Letterman later gleefully revealed, the music was written by Thomas Arne to a poem by James Thomson.

The Prime Minister did better on the Magna Carta, correctly answering that it was signed in 1215 at Runnymede.

Stumped: Despite his Eton education, he didn't know the literal translation of the Latin Magna Carta. The answer was Great Charter

Honest: Mr Cameron was also asked whether he was popular in the UK, replying: 'Not very popular, no. We have got this budget deficit'

But, despite his Eton education, he was stumped when asked for a literal translation of the Latin – Great Charter.

‘It would be good if you knew this,’ Mr Letterman said.

‘Yes, it would,’ the Prime Minister replied. ‘You’ve found me out. I’ve ended my career on your show tonight!’

The gentle mickey-taking continued with a series of questions about the British empire and the difference between Wales and England.

He correctly identified the population of Britain and the countries that make up the UK.

Mr Cameron was also asked whether he was popular in the UK, replying: ‘Not very popular, no. We have got this budget deficit – we have to make difficult decisions and that makes you unpopular.’

And he was quizzed about Larry, the Downing Street cat, who he admitted was a ‘terrible mouser’.

But despite the ribbing, Mr Cameron 
will have been pleased to have got over at least part of his message 
about the success of the Olympics and the attractiveness of the British 
economy.

He also underlined the fact that Britain is not in the troubled eurozone.

He said the economic outlook would ‘probably be worse’ if we were in the euro, adding: ‘In Europe if you are going to have a single currency you are going to end up with some form of single government – I don’t want that for Britain.’

In appearing on the show, Mr Cameron was following in the footsteps of Tony Blair, Boris Johnson and Barack Obama.

The PM was given top billing at the Ed Sullivan Theater in New York, sharing the bill with British folk rock band Mumford and Sons.

Aides insisted Mr Cameron had done only light preparation for the interview.

Broad answers were prepared on issues like the Olympics, his relationship with the Queen and his views on the US presidential race.

Sources said the PM had been braced for the fact that Letterman would crack jokes at his expense, but felt it was worth it if the interview would give him the chance to broadcast a positive message about the UK economy.

A Government source said: ‘Britain has had an extraordinary year. We have got something good to shout about. So getting out there talking up Britain is important. We should never forget that we are the biggest investor in America, America is the biggest investor in us.

‘There is a saying in business that when you want to do better, you go back to your biggest customers and try and squeeze out a bit more.’

'History of the UK for Dummies’ by David Cameron

By LARISA BROWN

The Prime Minister yesterday turned his hand to giving a history lesson.

But he proved it is not his best subject.

Despite his Eton-education, he stumbled on the answers to ‘dumb American questions’ on British history.

He perhaps should have guessed after 
he entered David Letterman's Late Show to the strains of Rule Britannia,
that the first topic of conversation might be the British Empire.

Asked about the countries which make 
up the British Empire, the Prime Minister responded: ‘It is not an 
empire it is the UK. Think of the United States. The United Kingdom of 
England, Scotland, Wales…’

Then,
like a school teacher in a classroom being quizzed by youngsters, Mr 
Cameron continued to describe the United Kingdom in a simplistic form, 
using a variety of hand gestures as an aid to his explanations.

Question: What is the deal on Wales?

David Cameron: ‘It is part of the UK. It is a small country but a very proud people.’

Question: ‘How are the Welsh different from the English?’

David Cameron: ‘Well
there are people in wales who speak a different language, who speak 
welsh as their first language but they are very much part of the United 
Kingdom.’

Question: What is the difference between Northern Ireland and Ireland?

David Cameron: ‘There was a time when all of Ireland was part of the UK.

‘There
was then a movement for Irish independence and when that happened the 
north of Ireland decided it wanted to stay with the United Kingdom so we
have the United Kingdom including Scotland, Wales, England and Northern
Ireland.

‘And the 
Republic of Ireland is a separate country not in the United Kingdom, 
don’t make that mistake.  But we have very good relations between the 
Republic of Ireland and the United Kingdom.’

Question: Is the division between Northern Ireland and Ireland religious?

David Cameron: ‘It is very complicated, there is huge amount of history involved in this.

‘It
is partly based on some religious differences but the majority of people 
who live in Northern Ireland, including both Protestants and Catholics, 
want to be, a majority want to be, part of the United Kingdom.

‘So
we had a big peace agreement which was all about respecting the rights 
of people in Northern Ireland to determine their own future.

‘And now relations between the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland are incredibly good.

‘Her
Majesty the Queen visited the Republic of Ireland last year, and it was
the first time a member of her family had been there since independence. It was a really big moment and the bonds now between the 
Republic of Ireland and the United Kingdom are very very strong.

Question: How many people are there in the UK?

David Cameron: 'About
60million. We the 22nd most populace country in the world. So we are 
very proud of the Olympics where we came third in the medals table, I 
want to just get that in'

Question: When was the Magna Carta signed?

David Cameron: '1215.'

Question: Where was it signed?

David Cameron: 'It was signed in Runnymede.'

Question: Is that where it is now?

David Cameron: 'No the Magna Carta is I believe, there is a copy of it I have seen which is in the Houses of Parliament. So it exists.

'The big moment of the Magna Carta was basically people saying to the king that you know other people have to have rights.

‘It
was very important that you respect- then it was the rights of noble 
rather just the rights of people. It was the seeds of democracy about 
people having rights and the crown not being able to ride roughshod over
everybody.'

Question: And the literal translation was?

David Cameron: 'Again, you are testing me.'
