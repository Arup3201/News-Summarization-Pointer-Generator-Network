At first glance, it looks like Apple's last generation handset, the iPhone 5S, with its curved edges, metallic band and silver home button surround.

However, in fact this is Samsung's latest Android handset, the Galaxy A7.

Samsung hopes the handset will appeal to Apple users, saying it is: 'one of the slimmest Galaxy smartphones equipped with premium hardware for a superior social experience.'

​'We strive to develop devices that appeal to a broad range of consumers and are ahead of the next big social trend,' said JK Shin, CEO of  Samsung Electronics. 

'Combining both a stunning metallic design and a powerful performance, the Galaxy A7 is stylish while delivering the superior user experience.' 

​The Galaxy A7 is equipped with a multicore processor combining two separate quad core processors, 16GB of memory and 2GB of RAM.

​It also has a 5 Megapixel front-facing camera and advanced selfie features including 'Ultra Wide Shot' and 'Auto Selfie' modes, which make it possible to take a photograph using only a voice command or even a simple wave of the hand. 

'The Galaxy A7, Galaxy A5 and Galaxy A3 are designed for those who want to express effortlessly their unique style,' the firm says. 

Apple's iPhone pioneered the unibody design - until the more recent iPhone 6 moved to a more rounded edge design.

​The Galaxy A7 will be available in selective market in Pearl White, Midnight Black, and Champagne Gold - unlike the iPhone, which is available in silver, gold and space grey.

'With these devices, Samsung continues to focus on creating smartphones equipped with the slimmest metal unibody on the market today, with comfortable grip for ease of use.'

It is believed the design is a key way Samsung believes it can beat off the threat of Apple, which has traditionally been the design conscious users handset.

'The range empowers users to choose a device which reflects their personal style and lifestyle needs, not just in terms of their unique features, but also their size and colour options,' said
