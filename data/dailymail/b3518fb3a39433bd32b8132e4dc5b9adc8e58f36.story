Manny Pacquiao's preparations for the biggest fight of his career against Floyd Mayweather Jnr have been disrupted by his opponent's manager/adviser, claims trainer Freddie Roach.

Pacquiao took to Instagram on Thursday to post the latest video of him at work from his Los Angeles training camp, as his $300million bout at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas draws closer on May 2.

However, Roach has accused Al Haymon - who works with Mayweather - as attempting to sabotage their sparring selections ahead of the fight.

Al Haymon is an adviser, manager and/or promoter to many top boxers in the United States.

The Cleveland-born Haymon initially made his fortune in music by promoting such acts as MC Hammer, Whitney Houston and The O’Jays before venturing into boxing.

A business administration graduate, his biggest client is Floyd Mayweather Jnr - who he helped leave Top Rank promotions.

As well as Mayweather his elite 150-fighter stable also includes Britain's Amir Khan, Deontay Wilder and Julio Cesar Chavez - a man Carl Froch is keen to fight.

The 55-year-old claims that they have had several chosen sparring partners, who have a similar fighting style to Mayweather, decline their offer to train with their camp because Haymon's team have offered them more more money to stay at home - in attempt to derail their preparations.

'I'm hiring sparring partners, Al Haymon's people calls them up and offers more money for them not to come. [But] I'm not worried about those guys,' Roach told ABS-CBN News.

'We got four really good sparring partners for Manny for this fight, Mayweather look-alikes.

'We started our game plan five years ago but we changed it a little bit. Definitely there will be some adjustments. I'm confident that we'll win the fight and this will be the biggest fight night of all our lives.

'The guy is undefeated, he's a very good boxer and he's the most talented fighter we'll ever face. He's tricky also... he's intelligent as a fighter. I believe we need to fight the perfect fight.'

The eagerly-anticipated bout on May 2 pits Mayweather's WBA and WBC welterweight world titles against Pacquiao's WBO crown in a unification fight.

The two camps have had an acrimonious relationship at times in the past and that appears to have continued following Roach's latest comments.

Despite the apparent setbacks, Pacquiao looked in good shape judging by his most recent social media upload which demonstrated his hand-speed.

The Philippine star's trait, combined with his punching-power, has proved a destructive combination that has yielded 57 wins from a 64-fight professional career - with 38 of those via knockout.

And these skills were on show as he he engaged in some shadow boxing in the ring.

Accompanied with the caption: 'Day 3 of my gym work out i feel slow but i'm not worried because i still have a lot of time. Thank you Lord for strengthening me day by day. God Bless everyone,' [sic] the southpaw boxer dances his way around the ring while throwing some combinations.
