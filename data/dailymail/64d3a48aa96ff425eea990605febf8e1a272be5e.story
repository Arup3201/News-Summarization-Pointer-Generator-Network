A teenager was brutally gang-raped by five men after being abducted as she walked home from a party.

The 18-year-old girl was grabbed and forced in a car before being driven to a unknown location on Sunday evening in Sydney's Hills district.

She was eventually released and went to hospital for treatment.

The girl was walking home at  Baulkham Hills at 1am on Sunday when a green sedan stopped next to her near St Michaels Place, reported Australian newspaper The Daily Telegraph.

The car, with five men inside, asked for directions to a nearby shopping centre.

The woman gave directions and continued walking, but she was grabbed from behind by one of the men and forced into the car.

She was then driven to an unknown location nearby and sexually assaulted by a number of men.

Following the assault, the woman was driven to Waterloo Road at Castle Hill and freed.

She was later taken to Westmead Hospital after reporting the terrifying ordeal at home.

She was released this morning and is hoping to help police track her attackers.

The head of the NSW Sex Crimes Squad, Detective Superintendent John 
Kerlatec labelled the attack as 'horrendous.'

Investigators have been told the car and males were seen outside the house party on Merindah Street earlier in the night.

The man seated in the front passenger seat who asked for directions has been described as being aged about 25, of Caucasian appearance, with a chubby build and a beard.

He was wearing a red and white shirt at the time.
