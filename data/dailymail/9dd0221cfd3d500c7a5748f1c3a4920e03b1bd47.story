The opening day of the 2014 Ryder Cup had more on offer than just golf.

It had cigar-smoking basketball legends, deers almost delaying play, a certain European golfer leaving his putter somewhere he shouldn't... but what else did you miss?

Here, Sportsmail keep you up to date with all that is going on at Gleneagles.

JORDAN'S QUIET DAY 

An indicator of the excitement around the first tee in the morning was the way Michael Jordan mingled among the public, going virtually unrecognised. This despite him sporting his trademark No 23 on the green armband he wears for his American TV work.

FAIRWEATHER WEBB 

Webb Simpson’s poor morning showing will fuel criticism of Tom Watson’s hunch to select him as a captain’s pick. Watson justified the decision by saying Simpson plays well at this time of year, ‘after the Solstice’, which came last Monday.

PASSING THE BUCK 

A deer almost stopped play before the second singles match featuring Thomas Bjorn and Martin Kaymer, scampering up the fairway before disappearing into the woods. Wildlife abounds in this area of Perthshire, including the protected black grouse.

CUP DRAWS THE CROWDS 

The 45,000 attendance shows the allure of the Ryder Cup. Scottish crowds have not been so enthusiastic for non-St Andrews Open Championships of late. Crowds were well down at Muirfield last year, drawing only 142,000 people overall, while Turnberry five years ago drew a relatively paltry aggregate of 115,000.

VICTOR'S PITCH AND RUN 

Frenchman Victor Dubuisson got caught short after answering a call of nature between the 11th and 12th hole. He went into the neighbouring convenience carrying his putter and then left it in there — luckily accompanying vice-captain Padraig Harrington was on hand to go back and retrieve the vital piece of equipment.

ANGIE'S TURNING HEADS 

At 6ft 3in and wearing a red beret, former basketball player Angie Watson, married to Bubba, was the most recognisable of the American wives. The other halves of Bubba’s opponents, Kate Rose and Emma Stenson, were notable mainly for Kate providing a caring supportive arm as pregnant Emma made the steep climbs around Gleneagles.
