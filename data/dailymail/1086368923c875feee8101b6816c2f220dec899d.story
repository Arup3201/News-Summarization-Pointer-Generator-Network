A package containing £1,000 worth of cannabis arrived in the post at the exact moment police were searching a man's house for drugs, a court heard.

Kyle Morgan, 23, from Lydney, Gloucestershire, was sentenced to a 12-month community order with 150 hours of unpaid work and ordered to pay £1,384.

He had agreed to allow cannabis deliveries from abroad to his home on behalf of a man known only as 'Jake,' Gloucester Crown Court was told.

Prosecutor David Scutt said UK Borders Agency intercepted a parcel addressed to Jake at Morgan's home on September 13 last year and found it contained 100 grams of cannabis.

And when police went to the address in October with a search warrant they initially found a small amount of cannabis worth £8, but then a parcel arrived containing a far larger quantity.

'A parcel was delivered during the course of the search which was also addressed to Jake,' said Mr Scutt.

'In the parcel, police found 91.4g of cannabis valued at £914. A number of identical empty bags were found in the premises.'

Morgan, who had no previous criminal convictions, admitted two offences of evading the prohibition on the importation of illegal drugs.

He said the small amount of cannabis was for his own use and the package was for a friend called Jake who had asked if he could have mail delivered there, according to Mr Scutt.

Matthew Harbinson, defending, said Morgan committed the offences out of 'naivety'.

He said Morgan had no connection or influence with others higher up the chain.

'He is a young man who is highly unlikely to be troubling the courts again,' said Mr Harbinson.

Judge Hart said he was 'somewhat sceptical' about the truth of Morgan's explanation but it was not challenged by the prosecution and he therefore sentenced him on that basis.

'It is clear you are ashamed of yourself for having got into this position,' said the judge.

He ordered the confiscation of £1,084 from Morgan under the Proceeds of Crime Act and ordered him to pay £200 costs.
