This is the dramatic moment a man jumped in front of an oncoming train to stop it from hitting a woman who had fallen onto the track.

The man, an off-duty Transportation Security Administration worker, saw the woman stuck and immediately rushed to try and bring the subway train approaching Chicago Avenue station in Illinois to a halt.

Luckily, for the woman, and the man carrying out the rescue, the incoming train stopped just short of the pair and they were able to be pulled to safety by the other commuters.

A man jumped into the path of an incoming train to save a woman who ended up on the track

The man, who risked his life to save that of the woman's was later named as 50-year-old Eddie Palacios, a father of two.

He told the website DNAinfo: 'It was really nothing. It was nothing, in the sense .. I have took myself in the mirror and I have to look at myself and feel good about myself.

'The young lady fell. As soon as she fell, I jumped on top of the train [tracks] to make sure that they saw her because I have an orange shirt.'

But after his heroics, it is said that Mr Palacios quickly left the scene and boarded another train. 

The train driver noticed the pair on the track and stopped just short of the woman and the man who saved her

The incident happened on Wednesday at 11.03 am in front of other commuters waiting for a blue line service at the busy station.

It is thought the train was just 30 feet away from the platform when the woman, who was reported as staggering around slipped on to the track.

This prompted screams from other passengers in the station before the footage shows the man, wearing an orange jacket, waving his arms in a bid to get the train to stop.

Afterwards a small amount of blood can be seen on the platform and it was reported she was taken to St Mary Hospital, where her condition is unknown.
