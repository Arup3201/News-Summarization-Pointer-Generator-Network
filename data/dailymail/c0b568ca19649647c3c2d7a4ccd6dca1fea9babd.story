The Mississippi tea party brawl isn't over yet, an attorney for Republican U.S. Senate candidate Chris McDaniel told reporters on Monday, and the insurgent conservative's campaign expects to find evidence of enough voter fraud in the June 24 primary runoff to trigger a new election.

That would be the third bare-knuckle contest between McDaniel and six-term senator Thad Cochran, a 76-year-old moderate Republican whose embrace of immigration reform and other liberal-leaning policies made him a prime target for the tea party movement.

McDaniel campaign counsel Mitch Tynersaid Monday that he 'would be surprised if we don’t find' enough fraudulent votes to throw out the June 24 results.

The campaign, he said, has already found 'thousands.' Last week it was reported that an initial review of ballots flagged at least 4,900 'irregularities.'

Mitch Tyner, an attorney representing U.S. Senate candidate Chris McDaniel, told reporters that 'there has indeed been election fraud in this case,' and said he would challenge the June 24 runoff results

A GOP runoff win for Sen. Thad Cochran (L) could be short-lived if Chris McDaniels (R) successfully shows that more ineligible votes were cast than the margin of victory

Cochran and McDaniel first squared off on June 10. McDaniel came out on top but neither won at least 50 per cent of the vote. The runoff two weeks later was supposed to settle the matter.

But complaints of fraud circulated throughout the state even before polls closed. They centered mostly on a seven-figure super PAC set up to benefit him, which paid for advertisements encouraging Democrats in majority-black counties to 'cross over' and vote in the Republican runoff.

The strategy is legal, but Democrats can only participate in another party's primary process if they haven't already voted in their own.

Mississippi law provides for 'automatically a new election,' Tyner said Monday, if the number of 'ineligible voters' exceeds the margin of victory.

That law, an election adviser in Hattiesburg, Mississippi, told MailOnline, wouldn't require McDaniel to find 6,700 fraudulent votes cast for his opponent. Any 6,700 ineligible votes would suffice.

'Most of them,' he said, 'are going to be absentee ballots. It's too easy to scam, and nobody ever checks unless the margin is this close or the result this unexpected.'

Tension built Monday as the Mississippi Republican party faced a 5:00 p.m. deadline to file its certified runoff results with state officials, and McDaniel aides fanned out across the state to work with county clerks to examine paper ballot applications from absentee voters.

Tyner said in a brief press conference that until Monday the campaign's representatives were not 'able to go into the courthouses, look in the ballot boxes and determine exactly what is contained in there, which includes the absentee information. And so, that is what we’re going after today.'

Cochran's campaign doesn't seem concerned.

His spokesman Jordan Russell said in a statement that '[w]e have representatives at all 82 courthouses today to monitor the review of ballot boxes and have been pleased with the results.'

'The county-by-county results reported thus far are revealing an extremely low number of crossover votes from the June 24th election. As the process moves forward, the conversation is shifting from wild, baseless accusations to hard facts.'

Russell told The Associated Press that Cochran's campaign had found only one single crossover vote out of more than 2,000 votes cast in Perry County; three out of 4,000 in Pontotoc County; five out of 2,000 cast in Leake County; and seven crossover voters out of more than 11,000 in Lauderdale County.

But the radio ads and fliers that blanketed black communities focused elsewhere in the state, including some with messages trying to tie McDaniel to the Ku Klux Klan in order to motivate Democratic voters.

The epicenter of the controversy is Hinds County, where Tyner spoke near the courthouse steps. More than 169,000 of the county's 245,000 residents are black, according to 2010 U.S. Census data.

Last week, McDaniel offered a $1,000 reward for information proving that fraudulent votes were cast on June 24.

'All Citizens for Mississippi,' a political committee that didn't legally exist before it produced and distributed literature like this flier, is one of the shadowy groups behind the cesspool-like politics in the Cochran-McDaniel fight

'It is imperative that an ineligible voter not be excluded from this,' Tyner said Monday, 'because when I vote and there’s an ineligible voter that also votes, he dilutes my vote. He dilutes your vote.'

McDaniel can challenge the result of the primary even after the results are certified, but he could also apply for an injunction in court on Monday afternoon that would prohibit the Mississippi Republican Party from finalizing its numbers.

A more likely scenario, however, would see the McDaniel campaign filing a challenge with the party, and then in court once party leaders had been given 10 days to review it.

And if Cochran's victory turns out to be short-lived?

'The correct remedy is a new election,' Tyner said.

The eventual victor will square off against former Democratic congressman Travis Childers in a less contentious matchup expected to yield a Republican senator in a deeply red state.

Nationally, the Republican party is teetering on the edge of reclaiming control of the U.S. Senate. That accomplishment would put the GOP in control of both houses of Congress for the first time since 2007.

Tea party Republican Chris McDaniel's campaign lawyer said Monday that he expects to find enough voter fraud to force a third Senate primary contest with aging centrist Thad Cochran

@highlight

Cochran won a runoff by about 6,700 votes, but McDaniel's attorney says campaign lawyers will almost certainly show at least that many 'ineligible voters' cast ballots

@highlight

Mississippi law would require a new election – after a primary fight and a runoff – between the two Republicans

@highlight

McDaniel's campaign is examining absentee ballot applications in every county to identify Democrats who illegally 'crossed over' to participate in the GOP primary after voting in the Democratic primary
