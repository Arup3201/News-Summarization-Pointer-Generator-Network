Mo Farah has pulled out of the Commonwealth Games, it was revealed today.

The 31-year-old double Olympic and world champion - who had previously been admitted to hospital with abdominal pains - was due to go for gold over 5,000 and 10,000 metres in Glasgow.

Team England said he had made good progress on his recovery from a recent illness, but withdrew to focus on getting back to full fitness in time for next month's European Championships in Zurich.

He's out: Team England announced that Mo Farah, 31, had withdrawn to focus on getting back to full fitness in time for next month's European Championships in Zurich

The news is a major blow to the Games, 
coming the morning after they launched with a spectacular opening 
ceremony at Celtic Park.

Farah said: ‘I have taken the tough decision to withdraw from the Commonwealth Games. The sickness I had two weeks ago was a big setback for me.'

The Londoner, who was set to be one of the biggest stars in Glasgow, pulled out of his last two races - the Sainsbury's Glasgow Grand Prix at Hampden Park and last Sunday's Anniversary Games - after being admitted to hospital in the United States with abdominal pains.

He has been training hard at his altitude base in Font Romeu in a bid to be fit for the Games, but they have come too soon. The 5,000m final takes place on the first evening of the athletics programme on Sunday.

Farah added: ‘Training is getting better here in Font Romeu but I need another few weeks to get back to the level I was at in 2012 & 2013.

‘I really wanted to add the Commonwealth titles to my Olympic and World Championships but the event is coming a few weeks too soon for me as my body is telling me it's not ready to race yet. Best wishes to my fellow athletes in Glasgow.’

Team England chef de mission Jan Paterson said: ‘It is a real blow for any athlete to miss out on a major championships through injury, but to have fought so hard to regain full fitness and to have to take such a difficult decision at this stage is particularly hard. We wish Mo all the very best and hope to see him back to his peak very soon.’

Farah’s withdrawal comes after Canada's Nic Hamilton was forced out of the track cycling events after crashing into an official in the Sir Chris Hoy Velodrome today.

Hamilton suffered concussion while the official suffered a suspected broken collarbone in the accident. The velodrome was closed for 30 minutes, delaying a visit from Prince Charles and Camilla.
