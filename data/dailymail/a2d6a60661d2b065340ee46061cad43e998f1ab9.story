Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg is using the same app that caught him texting while driving last week.

Last night, Zuckerberg found a scary-looking spider in his bathroom and posted a picture of it using the app Jelly.

The app was developed by Twitter co-founder Biz Stone for crowd-sourcing questions from social media friends. Users post a picture with a question and other users contribute their answers.

What's this? Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg posted a picture of a spider in his bathroom using the app Jelly, the same app that caught him texting and driving last week

The app aided in the embarassment of Zuckerberg last week when user Ben Schaechter posted a picture of the Facebook founder texting while driving.

'Mark Zuckerberg texting and driving. How do you respond?' Schaechter wrote.

But that hasn't stopped Zuckerberg from continuing to use the app.

'What kind of spider is this, and is it okay to let it keep living in my shower?' Zuckerberg queried his friends last night. 

The app's COO Kevin Thau answered the question, identifying the spider as a Phiddippus Johnsoni and said Zuckerberg should 'probably want to relocate it out of the house.'

Twitter co-founder Biz Stone, right, launched Jelly last Tuesday. One user caught Mark Zuckerberg, left, while texting and driving and posted the picture on the app asking 'Mark Zuckerberg texting and driving. How do you respond?'

While the spider is not poisonous, but it does bite and has the ability to jump.

'First life saved on Jelly! (The spider, not Zuck)' Stone later tweeted.

The app has been called a 'vanity project' by critics despite Stone believing it can grow into an 'awesome business'.

Stone thinks the app will help teach people that computer-driven algorithms don't necessarilly have all the answers in life.

‘If we are successful, then we will be introducing into the daily muscle memory of a whole lot of people this idea of, “How can I help someone today?”’ said Stone. ‘Maybe we can sort of nudge up the global empathy quotient so people start thinking about other people a little more.’

But some critics aren’t so sure, Valleywag has described it as ‘an app for the sake of apps’, a ‘software Fabergé egg’ and a ‘vanity project.’

Ben Schaechter was quick to put the Jelly app to good use and posted his photo of the Facebook founder along with the words 'Mark Zuckerberg texting and driving. How do you respond?'

‘Have you ever posted on Facebook, asking if anyone knows a good 
barber? Or tweeted to your followers asking if "House of Cards" is any 
good? That's Jelly - a search engine that uses your friends - only more 
convoluted than ever before,’ wrote Valleywag’s Sam Biddle.

Stone,
 39, can afford to gamble on a company with an altruistic bent after 
Twitter's successful public stock offering two months ago.

Twitter's
 stock has more than doubled from its initial public offering price of 
$26. Just how many millions Stone has made from Twitter remains a 
mystery because he didn't own enough stock for his stake to be disclosed
 in regulatory filings.

He has also persuaded former Vice 
President Al Gore and U2 lead singer Bono to invest, as well as Reid 
Hoffman, who became a billionaire as co-founder and chairman of 
professional networking service LinkedIn Corp.

The venture capital firm Spark Capital also has invested an undisclosed amount.

Eventually, Jelly's app will extend its reach into other online networks besides Twitter and Facebook, Stone said.
