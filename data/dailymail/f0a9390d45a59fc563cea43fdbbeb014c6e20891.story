The average price of regular gas has fallen to $3.19 a gallon, with drivers in eight states now able to fill up their cars for less than $3.

Prices have been dropping by about a penny a day, according to AAA, with another six states close to falling below the $3 mark soon.

The fall in prices has been credited to a strong flow of cheap crude coming from Canada and North Dakota.

'In almost half the states, you don't 
need to make a great effort to find gas at $3 or less,' Tom Kloza, an 
oil analyst, told CNN Money.

Drivers in eight states already pay less than the $3 per gallon average, according to GasBuddy.com. They are:

Missouri                      2.842  

Oklahoma                    2.868

Arkansas                     2.914

Texas                           2.922

Kansas                        2.927

Louisiana                    2.966

New Mexico                2.977

Mississippi                 2.995

Drivers filling up on regular fuel in eight states, including Missouri, Kansas and Texas, are already benefiting from pump prices below the $3 average.

It is estimated that nearly 20 per cent of gas stations across the U.S. are already charging less than $3 a gallon, according to the Oil Price Information Service.

Mr Kloza believes the drop in prices will continue until the end of the year, with more than half the states coming in below the $3 mark by Christmas.

The drop is in part because of a steady and cheap supply of oil, described as 'the cheapest crude on the planet' by Mr Kloza. 

Refineries have benefited from a quiet hurricane season and few disruptions.

If the supply continues uninterrupted, the national average price per gallon could fall to its lowest since 2010.

'It’s been a favorable confluence of 
global and domestic factors that have brought us to this point and all 
of them suggest incrementally lower prices at the pump in the weeks 
ahead,' Patrick DeHaan, senior analyst with GasBuddy.com, said.  

However, drivers in states such as New York and California, which both have an average of 
around $3.50 at the pump, and Hawaii which has the highest average at 4.020, are unlikely to benefit from a drop in prices.

The prices in some states will also suffer from fuel taxes. California, which has the third highest pump price, adds tax at 48.7 cents, according to Forbes.

New York drivers pay the most in tax for their gas, at 50.6 cents, according to figures from January, where as Alaska charges the least, at 8 cents.

The national average for state tax, which includes excise, environmental fees, storage tank taxes and general sales tax, is 18.4 cents.
