A suspected bank robber has been shot by LAPD officers in a Beverley Hills hotel lobby on iconic Rodeo Drive.

The man is said to have been confronted by officers in the lobby of the $250-a-night Luxe Hotel after trying to steal from a Bank of America one block away. 

A second man suspected in the robbery was held and questioned, according to the LA Times. 

Officers stand outside the Luxe Hotel in downtown Beverly Hills after a suspect was shot during a confrontation in the lobby 

The area surrounding the street in Los Angeles was closed as police spoke to witnesses. The suspect was taken to hospital 

The man hit by police was taken to hospital. Police have said he was responding to officers as he was transported away and has undergone surgery. 

According to KTLA, the suspect tried to check himself into the hotel as a guest. 

However officers managed to track him down using a GPS device hidden inside the bag of money which was taken. 

A witness who said he was trapped in the nearby Chanel boutique told the station the scene was 'surreal.'

Eric Turico said: 'The first thing that we saw was helicopters swarming all around Rodeo Drive. I saw one, then two, then three of them.'

Officers have since shut down the street in order to look for witnesses and have urged shoppers to stay away. 

Last week police were searching for two suspects after a Citibank on nearby Wilshire Boulevard was robbed. Authorities however do not know whether the two incidents are connected.
