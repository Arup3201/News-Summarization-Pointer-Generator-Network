A woman was arrested at gunpoint Thursday at Miami International Airport after screaming at police officers that she had a bomb.

Julissa Magdalena Maradiaga-Iscoa, 33, from Honduras, attempted to drive her car through the airport's entrance, but instead crashed into a patrol car.

She then began screaming at officers in what they believe was Arabic and saying that she had a bomb.

The Miami Herald reports that the incident happened at around 4pm, and that parts of the airport were quickly closed off while an investigation was conducted.

The woman can be seen being arrested at gunpoint as a bomb sniffing dog is brought over, detecting no explosives.

The police turned the case over the the FBI.

'At this time there appears to be no nexus to terrorism,’' Michael Leverock, special agent, FBI Miami, said in a statement. 

The woman was driving a silver Toyota when, according to Miami-Dade Detective Alvaro Zabaleta, she 'made a right turn and drove through the inner loop making an intentional attempt to breach airport security by attempting to drive her vehicle through the airport entrance.' 

Maradiaga-Iscoa now faces federal charges and is expected to appear in court on Friday.
