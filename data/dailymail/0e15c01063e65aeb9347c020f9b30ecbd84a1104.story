Winking, poking out his tongue and firing an imaginary gun in sunglasses, this is the leader of the free world clowning around in the Oval Office.

Although some might expect him to have more pressing matters on his plate such as the fighting in Syria, Iraq and Ukraine, Barack Obama found time to pose for a video released yesterday in a bid to reach out to young voters.

Filmed in the White House, it aims to spread the word about his overhaul of the nation’s health system to a tech-savvy generation.

Poking out his tongue, he goes on to practice telling people to use the U.S. health system while staring at himself

Firing an imaginary gun while wearing his sunglasses, he also pretends to be playing basketball in the light-hearted video

The footage, which received 100,000 views within an hour of being posted online, is titled ‘Things Everybody Does But Doesn’t Talk About’.

It starts with the President, 53, making faces in a mirror, wearing sunglasses and shaping his fingers like a gun.

Then he strikes a series of poses with a ‘selfie stick’ winking into the lens before running through his healthcare patter and struggling to pronounce ‘February’.

He finishes by saying, ‘YOLO, man’ – you only live once – although it may take him a lifetime to live this down.
