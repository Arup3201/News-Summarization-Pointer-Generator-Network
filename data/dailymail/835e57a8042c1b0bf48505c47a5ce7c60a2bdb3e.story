A high school teacher and former secretary threw a high school prom after-party for students and gave them beer, witnesses have told police.

Samantha Murchie, a science teacher at J. W. Mitchell High School in Pasco County, Florida, and Lynn Worker, 52, allegedly held a party for about 40 teenagers at Worker's home in New Port Richey.

The minors allegedly slurped from a keg of beer set up on Worker's patio and also had access to liquor, according to an incident report from the Pasco County Sheriff's Office, WTSP reported.

When some 
of the students were sick or suffered hangovers, Murchie, 43, made them
 food and allowed them to stay at her home, teenagers told police.

Witnesses said that Worker had allowed the students to dig in to the alcohol after taking their car keys from them.Â 

'When she took keys away from kids that made it okay for the kids to drink? Which is absurd,' one concerned parent told WTSP.

'I'm really, really baffled by the whole thing. Why would someone ever even think about doing that?'

The two women, who are both mothers, are not currently facing any criminal charges, but the 
Pasco County Sheriff's Office says bringing any charges will be the decision of the state attorney's office.

Murchie is also on paid administrative leave from the high school, WTSP reported.

Worker resigned earlier this year during an 
investigation into her behavior at a football game, school officials added.

It is not the first time that Murchie, a married mother of two, has been in trouble with the school, and she has four disciplinary letters in her personal file.

They lambast her for her behavior at football games, with parents saying she smelled of alcohol at an away game last October, while others complained of her treatment of their children.

School: Murchie and Worker have both found themselves in trouble for their conduct at football games played by J. W. Mitchell High School, including complaints of drinking and rude comments

One letter says she and another employee 'routinely shout mocking and 
sarcastic comments to the cheerleading squad in an effort to undermine 
and embarrass them'.

Her previous violating of Pasco school's code of ethics resulted in a two-day suspension.

Records show she was charged in 2005 with having an open container and given a maximum of six months probation.

The letters on her file show she denied drinking before games and said she only went to support her son on the field.
