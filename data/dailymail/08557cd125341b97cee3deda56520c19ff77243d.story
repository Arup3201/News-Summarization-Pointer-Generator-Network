Prime Minister David Cameron said he did not want to see 'people's love divided by the law'

Legalising gay marriage says ‘something deeper about the sort of country we are’, David Cameron said ahead of the first weddings this weekend.

The Prime Minister said he backed the change because he ‘didn't want to see people's love divided by law’.

Hundreds of gay and lesbian couples are expected to tie the knot in the coming weeks, with the first ceremonies held this Saturday.

The law was changed last year, when more than 130 Conservatives MPs voted against the bill but it was passed with the support of the Lib Dems and Labour.

Mr Cameron said: ‘Making marriage available to everyone goes beyond individual relationships, proposals and weddings– it says something deeper too about the sort of country we are.

‘This is a country with proud traditions of tolerance, respect and equal worth. With this reform we are being true to those values.

‘In turn we are sending a powerful message to young people growing up who are uncertain about their sexuality: we are telling them that they are equal.’

Mr Cameron has previously admitted gay marriage has been deeply unpopular within Tory ranks.

But in an article ahead of the first ceremonies taking place on Saturday, Mr Cameron said he was ‘pleased’ that the commitment people make to each other will now be recognised as equal.

The Prime Minister said: ‘I backed this change because I didn't want to see people's love divided by law. There is something special about marriage.

‘It is a declaration of commitment, responsibility and stability that helps to bind families. The values of marriage are give and take, support and sacrifice – and it is right that same sex couples will now be able to be a part of it.’

First: Same-sex weddings will be able to take place in England and Wales from Saturday March 29

In the article with Attitude 
Magazine’s commemorative edition to mark the legialstion, Mr Cameron 
said he had been touched by the personal stories of those affected.

‘I
 am pleased that the love people have for each other – and the 
commitment they want to make – will now be recognised as equal,’ he 
said.

David Cameron gave his interview to Attitude magazine's commemorative edition

‘This is an important 
change brought home to me by a mum in my constituency recently who said:
 “I've got a straight son and a gay daughter and I now know I'm going to
 be able to go to both of their weddings”.’

The
 first gay weddings were not expected to take place until later this 
year or early 2015, but changes were rushed through for the first 
ceremonies to be held on March 29.

Same-sex
 weddings in some British embassies and armed forces bases overseas and 
military chapels are expected to be allowed from June.

By
 the end of the year couples who entered civil partnerships will be able
 to convert them into a legal marriage by the end of the year.

But Mr Cameron warned: ‘We of course would be foolish to think that all problems with equality have been solved.

‘The UK may be rated as the best place in Europe for LGBT equality – but there still remains much more to be done. We press ahead– for example- with our work on homophobic bullying in schools and we continue to challenge governments where outright persecution of gay people is commonplace.

‘All that is left is to send my warmest congratulations to all the couples who will shortly be getting married – and to wish you every possible happiness in the future ahead.’
