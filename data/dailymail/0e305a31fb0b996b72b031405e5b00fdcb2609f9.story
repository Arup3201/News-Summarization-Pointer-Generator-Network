It's the quintessential way for Australians to start their day - and now a new study has revealed how many people eat Vegemite for breakfast on a typical day. 

The Roy Morgan research found that of the 7,550,000 people who eat the iconic spread in an average week, 6,405,000 were born in Australia.

This figure equates to 45 per cent of people born in Australia and 83 per cent of the world's total consumption.

By comparison, 43 per cent of  New Zealanders, 30 per cent of those born in the UK or Ireland and just 12 per cent of Asian-born residents eat the yeast-based spread in an average week.

Meanwhile, jam is the most popular spread among people born in the UK or Ireland with 39 per cent eating the spread in an average week. 

Those born elsewhere in Europe, 38 per cent, and Asia, 28 per cent, prefer honey as their spread of choice, while those born in the US are most likely to eat peanut butter at 49 per cent.

'With its unique taste and unappealing appearance, Vegemite inspires either love or hate in people,' said Angela Smith, Group Account Director of Roy Morgan Research. 

Vegemite is often viewed as one of the most quintessentially Aussie foods

'It's no real surprise that Australian-born Aussies are most likely to eat Vegemite in an average week, while those born in other regions tend to favour spreads more prevalent in those regions: peanut butter for US-born folks, jam for people born in the UK or Ireland, and so on' she said.

 Ms Smith said the study was intended to recognise the differrent consumer preferences of people around the world.

'Understanding the demographics, attitudes and behaviours of consumers who favour different kinds of spreads is crucial for brands seeking to communicate effectively with their present and potential markets, and potentially even influence their preferences with some smart, targeted marketing.'
