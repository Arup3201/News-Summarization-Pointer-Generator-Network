Anders Lindegaard is understood to be the Manchester United player who failed to watch El Clasico with his team-mates on Saturday.

United coach Louis van Gaal revealed after Sunday's draw with Chelsea that his first-team squad - bar one player - watched the match between Real Madrid and Barcelona together. 

Van Gaal asked for a screen to be set up in a room at The Lowry Hotel in Salford but said one member of the match-day squad was not present.

'We went to the Lowry, we had a screen so I could watch the second half and 17 players of 18 were there,' Van Gaal explained. 'I have never experienced that before. We have a lot of Spaniards!

'I won’t tell you which one wasn’t there.'

However, Sportsmail understands Danish goalkeeper Lindegaard was the player who chose not to join his team-mates. 

Attendance was not considered compulsory but his absence was noted, particularly when all the other squad members chose to come down from their hotel rooms and watch Real Madrid run out 3-1 winners against arch rivals Barcelona. 

United declined to comment when contacted by Sportsmail on Tuesday morning.

Van Gaal added: 'It was the quality of the game - Real Madrid vs Barcelona.

'I told the players, ''You have seen what they have done because for example, Barcelona under Gerardo Martino pressed from the front, but under Luis Enrique it is from behind.''

Manager Van Gaal admitted he was shocked to find so many of his players watching El Clasico

'Real Madrid pressed from behind, they drop in and they were very compact. After Real scored the second, the match was over because Barcelona don’t keep compact.'

Lindegaard, 30, was an unused substitute for Sunday's match with Chelsea and is expected to leave in January after being told he is free to find a new club.

Former Barcelona goalkeeper Victor Valdes, who is also staying at The Lowry, is continuing to have his fitness assessed at Carrington ahead of a possible deal and was sat alongside Paddy McNair and Jonny Evans in the main stand at Old Trafford on Sunday to watch the draw with Chelsea.
