A father accused of killing his six 
children in a house fire told police he could not believe he was being 
arrested over the blaze, a court has heard.

Detective Constable Steven Barnes, 
from Derbyshire Police, told Nottingham Crown Court that Michael 
Philpott said: 'I just can’t believe this is happening' when he was 
arrested along with his wife Mairead over the fatal house fire at their 
three-bedroom house in Allenton, Derby, last May.

Philpott cried in the dock this 
morning as the constable read out his interview with police on April 29 
following his arrest for the fire which claimed the lives of his 
children on May 11.

At the start of the interview at 
Ripley police station, Philpott told Det Con Barnes: 'I just can’t 
believe this is happening. I don’t think you understand what it is like 
losing six children,' the court heard.

Describing the night of the fire, Philpott told Det Con Barnes he and his wife had been woken up by the downstairs smoke alarm.

Philpott said he did not see any flames when he went into the living room, just a 'bright light'.

He told the constable he did not know 
there was a fire until flames and black smoke 'shot' out through the 
living room doorway, Det Con Barnes told the court.

Philpott told the constable he tried 
several times to smash the window into his daughter Jade’s back bedroom 
but could not get into the house.

'This horrible thing, I dream it every night,' he told the police officer.

He told Det Con Barnes he dreamed about not being able to get into his daughter’s bedroom and that he felt 'far away' from her.

'I smashed the windows about five 
times. I wish now I’d got in. It would have been me in that morgue and 
not my kids,' Philpott said, the court heard.

During the interview, Philpott told 
officers the day before the fire had gone as normal with him taking the 
children to school then playing snooker with Paul Mosley at the house 
before going to bed with Mairead in the conservatory.

Six siblings died as a result of the 
fire on May 11 - Jade, 10, and brothers John, nine, Jack, eight, Jesse, 
six and Jayden, five, died during the blaze.

Their brother Duwayne, 13, was taken 
to Derby Royal Hospital and transferred to Birmingham Children’s 
Hospital, but died three days later.

Their parents, Mick and Mairead 
Philpott, and a third defendant, Paul Mosley, 46, are on trial over the 
deaths of the children. They have each denied six counts of 
manslaughter.

The prosecution claim the children’s 
deaths were the result of a botched 'plan' to frame 56-year-old 
Philpott’s former mistress, Lisa Willis.

The court has heard how Miss Willis, 
29, left the home she had shared with the couple and their six children 
in February, taking her five children with her.

The jury has been told Philpott and 
Miss Willis were due to face each other at a court hearing over access 
to the five children, four of which he had fathered, on the day of the 
blaze.

Philpott said the children had been 
distressed by the departure of Miss Willis and her children. He told the
constable that usually Jessie, John and Jack shared the front bedroom 
of the three-bedroom house.

Duwyane and Jayden shared one of the back bedrooms, while Jade was in the second, Philpott told the officer.

But after Miss Willis left, Philpott 
said, the children often swapped rooms because they were upset and 
missed the other children, the court heard.

He said on the night of the fire he 
and Mairead had left the house to get some weed for Mosley, who looked 
after the children while they were gone.

He told the police none of them smoked it once they returned to the house at around 10pm.

The policeman said Philpott explained 
that Miss Willis and her children had lived with him and his wife and 
that they had shared a three-way relationship until she left in 
February, taking her five children with her.

'I treated Lisa like she was a queen. 
For the past four years I have given her all my attention and not my 
wife,' Philpott told him.

He said he had no idea why Miss Willis had left the house.

'At first I blamed Mairead for a bit, 
then I realised it was down to Lisa. She didn’t want Mairead to be 
mother to her kids anymore.

'Mairead brought them children up, not
Lisa. I wanted my kids back, my kids are everything to me, my kids are 
my life, you don’t understand that,' Philpott said during the interview.

In a further interview on May 30, 
Philpott warned police that they might find traces of petrol on his 
clothing and Duwayne’s and also in the house.

He said his petrol strimmer had been 
brought through the house by him and his eldest son in the days before 
the fire for a neighbour to borrow.

The constable went on to ask Philpott whether he was responsible for the fire at his house.

'Watch these eyes - categorically no. Nor was my wife,' Philpott told him.

When asked how he knew petrol was used in the fire, Philpott claimed the police had told him.

Fall: Philpott, pictured with his wife Mairead, also passed out after a press conference in Derby (pictured)

'I knew on the morning of the press conference, before I even went in,' he said in the interview.

When he was told the police had not told him, Philpott claimed he had heard from locals that it had been petrol.

'You made an assumption it was petrol?' Dc Barnes asked him. 'Yeah, we assumed it was petrol,' Philpott replied.

When asked about the hearing with Miss
Willis regarding residency of her five children, he said he believed he
was going to win custody of the youngsters.

'We thought we were going to win the children,' Philpott told the constable.

He said he and his wife had received death threats from Miss Willis and her family and that he had reported these to the police.

Later in the interview, Philpott told 
police: 'You’ve got to believe me. Me and my wife had nothing to do with
that fire. Nothing.'

When police asked him about two fire 
extinguishers in the kitchen, Philpott replied: 'I didn’t think about 
water, I didn’t think about fire extinguishers. I just thought about 
getting in to my children.'

He added: 'I couldn’t try any harder to get into the house to my children. My kids are the most important thing in my life.'
