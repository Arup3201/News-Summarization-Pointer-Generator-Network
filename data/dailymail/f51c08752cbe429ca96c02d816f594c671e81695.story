A Massachusetts man has been accused of smashing a computer tablet against the face of his girlfriend's newborn following about two months of ongoing abuse. 

Enrique Santiago, 20, has been charged with multiple counts of assault for repeatedly squeezing, shaking and slamming 10-week-old Brendan Joseph while his girlfriend was at work.

He was arrested after allegedly hitting the baby with a computer tablet in a pillow case on December 26 because he wouldn't stop crying. The infant was rushed to hospital with brain swelling, retinal bleeding and multiple fractures.

Nashua Patch reported the baby's mother, Maria Tata, rushed him to a Boston hospital, where he is in a critical but stable condition.

The little boy is expected to survive but is likely to have lasting disabilities.

The hospital notified police because the baby's injuries were so severe. His face, ear and buttocks were bruised, and further examination revealed he had older injuries including fractured ribs.

'This was a pattern of abuse that increased over time and culminated with Mr. Santiago striking the child in the head with an iPad-type tablet which was in a pillow case,' Nashua, N.H., police Lt. Francis Sullivan told Boston Herald.

Police did not say whether Santiago was the baby's father, but only identified him as the boyfriend of the baby's mother.

Santiago frequently posted updates on his Facebook page about how much he enjoyed babysitting his little 'son' Brendan.

'Home with my son missing my wifey cant wait to see her — feeling happy,' he wrote on December 20.

'Home chillin with my babe and the little man having quality time. — feeling wonderful,' Santiago posted on December 7.

Santiago pleaded not guilty in Nashua district court on Monday to a dozen counts of first-degree assault and one count of second-degree assault. He was held on a $1 million bond.

Lawrence police arrested Santiago on Monday on a fugitive warrant.
