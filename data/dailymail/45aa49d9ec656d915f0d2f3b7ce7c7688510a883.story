McKinzy Livsey, 15, of Oklahoma City was driving around in a golf cart on Sunday at Arbuckle Mountains with  friends when the decision to switch seats with the driver likely caused her to fall out head first.

It is thought the cart hit a bump, propelling McKinzy onto the ground and leaving her with skull fractures, brain swelling, and blood clots, reports News 9.

Life changing moment: McKinzy Livsey of Ohlahoma City was driving around in a golf cart on Sunday at  with friends when the decision to switch seats with the driver likely caused her to fall out head first

Hospitalized: McKinzy has been left with skull fractures, brain swelling, and blood clots and on Wednesday night in the hospital she passed out in her mother's arms, nearly hitting her head again

McKinzy's parents Travis and Shannon Livsey were horrified to receive a call on Sunday with the sounds of their injured daughter screaming in the background.

'Something happened with McKinzy, and you need to come home immediately,' McKinzy's mother says she was told during the heart wrenching phone call.

'I said who is that screaming in the background, and she said it was McKinzy,' said Shannon.

McKinzy was flown to OU Children's Hospital where the family is standing by their daughter as she gets numerous x-rays to asses her condition.

McKinzy's father says his daughter was just being a teenager and a momentary decision to switch seats without paying attention to the gas pedal caused her injuries.

'They switched. McKinzy's foot stayed on the gas,' said McKinzy's father, Travis Livsey.

'They were just being typical teenagers, and without thinking, or stopping, apparently they kept driving.'

In recovery: McKinzy is recovering from her injuries (right) and has still maintained her youthful spirit from before she was in the tragic accident

Travis says he thinks the girls hit a bump causing McKinzy to fall out head first.

'I'm thinking first part to hit the ground was her head, because that's where the most trauma is obviously.'

Shannon told News 9 that Wednesday night in her daughter's hospital was terrifying.

McKinzy passed out in her mother's arms and had her mother not been there to catch her she might have hit her head again.

'Last night was really bad,' said Shannon.

Traumatizing: McKinzy's parents describe the horrifying phone call they received after their daughter was injured and say they could hear her screams in the background 

Positive attitude: McKinzy and her family are trying to stay strong and her parents say they put their faith in God to help them get through these difficult times

'And if I hadn't been there to catch her, she would have hit her head again.'

Shannon said that she is staying strong my having faith and was recently moved by a message from a motivational speaker.

'It gets real when your struggle lasts longer than your strength, but God will carry you through,' said Shannon Livsey reading the quote by Trent Shelton.

'And I thought that was just kind of ironic given what we're now going through. So just have faith,' said Shannon Livsey as she held back tears.

'One day at a time,' she added in the hopes her daughter may some day lead a normal life again.

The family has set up a Go Fund Me for their daughter whose medical bill are mounting. They have raised just over $3,000 and have a $10,000 goal. 

Bright future: Before the accident McKinzy was healthy and strong and had a whole entire future ahead of her and her family hopes she will recover soon
