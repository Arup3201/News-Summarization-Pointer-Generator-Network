From huddling together to watch a beautiful sunset to enjoying a burger at McDonald's to celebrate their birthdays, these are the inseparable sheepdog sisters whose owner documents every aspect of their lives together.    

Amateur photographer Cees Bol, from Sibculo, the Netherlands, takes pictures of his dogs Sophie, six, and four-year-old Sarah every day, posting them on social media for the pets' online followers.

But instead of capturing the animals going for walks or fetching sticks, the 46-year-old and his partner Hannake snap their beloved English Sheepdogs in an adorable series of human scenarios.

Mr Bol takes adorable pictures of his pets every single day and posts them to social media, where the dogs now have an online following 

Mr Bol says the main reason why he continues to snap pictures of his beloved pets is because he likes putting a smile on people's faces 

Mr Bol often gets the dogs to adopt a series of human poses in his pictures. Pictured are Sophie and Sarah taking fellow sheepdogs Jason and Ashley to McDonald's for Sophie's birthday  

And the daily images of the pets, and their friends, include trips to McDonalds, sitting at the dinner table and posing in a number of outfits.

Mr Bol said: 'The main reason I take the photos is so I can make people happy and put a smile on their face - well, Sophie and Sarah do.

'In a world full of bad things, I found a way to make it a little bit brighter. And seeing people happy makes me happy.

'We get a lot of messages about the pictures such as your pictures make my day, when I'm sad I look at your picture's and I feel better, your photos make me happy and warm.

With their tongues hanging out and tails wagging, Sarah and Sophie perch over a branch after enjoying a walk in the Dutch countryside

Mr Bol says he is planning to make a book of all the adorable images he has snapped of his two sheepdogs Sophie and Sarah 

Mr Bol posts his images online on hosting site 500px and his photos of Sophie, Sarah and the other dogs have received almost 60,000 views

'When we picked up Sophie six years ago the breeder told us she didn't like to pose for photos, but that soon changed. She is the best poser of the two.

'Sophie will do almost anything for us but Sarah is a bit more naughty - she will pose but more for the cookies than to please.'

Mr Bol posts his images online on hosting site 500px and his photos of Sophie, Sarah and the other dogs have received almost 60,000 views.

And he is planning to make use of the catalogue of images to create a book about the lives of the dogs - who are sisters by birth - in the future.

He said: 'We live in the countryside so we often go for walks in the woods, and when we go out we take the dogs with us, even on most of our vacations if possible.

As well as taking pictures of just Sophie and Sarah, Mr Bol and his partner Hannake often pose up their pets with other dogs 

Mr Bol said he met his partner Hannake through their shared love of dogs after he looked after her pets for her for a week

'I'm not a professional photographer, just an amateur with years of experience - so when I see a lovely view I take a few pictures with the dogs.

'Besides that I come up with a lot of ideas that I try to turn into photographs. And if I need more dogs my friend joins me with his sheepdogs, Jason and Ashley.

'And once a year for Sophie's Birthday we go to McDonalds and order french fries and burgers for them - a kind of doggy birthday party - which is where that photo came from.

'Hannake and I actually met because of the dogs, I had one Old English Sheepdog and she had two. I needed someone to look after mine for a week and Hannake agreed. After that we went on a date and became a couple.'
