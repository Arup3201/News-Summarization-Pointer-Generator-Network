It is not the material that immediately springs to mind when building your dream home, but it certainly makes the property affordable.

Farmer and architect Patrick Bradley decided to create his perfect home out of four shipping containers, but that doesn't mean he held back on the luxury elements.

His mother Ann thinks that by building this house, her 34-year-old bachelor son will attract a wonderful wife.

Getting the containers to the site proved to be a difficult task and at times it looked as if Mr Bradley's dreams would be shattered

'I'm desperate for him to get a gorgeous girl. I just want to see him happy,' she explains when the Channel 4 Grand Designs team turn up to cover the project.

But as the lorries carrying the huge container ships turn into the country lane, Ann's expression is one of distaste rather than excitement.

'They're not very pretty, are they?' she says to the camera. 'Just as is, they're not pretty.'

In the latest episode, Mr Bradley, a farmer and architect from Northern Ireland, hopes to make a home out of the shipping containers, which will be welded together to form a giant cross.

The £133,000 house design is cantilevered over a stream at a beautiful and secluded spot on the family farm.

The qualified architect, who has three sisters, will one day inherit the farm and needs a home that will work on a dual level, fulfilling his needs as farmer, and also an architect.

Expensive bath: This bath cost the architect and farmer £16,000, which contributed to him going over budget

But in the episode, the first issue he needs to overcome is the fact the massive trucks find it difficult to turn into the roads leading to his farm. 

Eventually the driver manages to manoeuvre the truck, as instructions are shouted at him from the observers. 

But the worst is not over. The shipping containers have to be precisely placed on their concrete pad foundations and Mr Bradley can only pray that his measurements are correct as if they're even slightly out, the structure could buckle.

Before and after: The containers were sourced from a supplier in Belfast Docks. Mr Bradley's dream home is featured on tonight's episode of Grand Designs on Channel 4

'Pull, pull, would you pull, would you,' the movers shout at each other as Mr Bradley leans low, keeping his eyes on the bottom of the containers.

But the experienced architect needn't have worried as, much to his relief, the bottoms of the container fit perfectly on their stone foundations. 

Mr Bradley designed both the interior and exterior of the containers, which were from a shipping container supplier in Belfast Docks.

His original budget was £100,000 but the architect found that he had expensive tastes and a few costly extras, including a £16,000 bath, pushed his total cost up to £133,000.

Mr Bradley lives in a very close community in Northern Ireland and the architecture in the surrounding areas is very traditional and conservative. His design, in comparison, is radically modern. 

The episode featuring Patrick Bradley will air tonight (24 September) at 9pm on Channel 4.
