A 23-year-old Air Force trainee who was recruited as an undercover informant has been caught up in a nasty battle with her former supervisors as they have launched an effort to smear her reputation and possibly get her kicked out of the military after allegedly being raped.

Jane Neubauer originally intended to go into the Air Force's meteorology program but was diverted after being asked to work for the secretive Office of Special Investigations, effectively using her connections to her peers to help root out drug rings.

In a lengthy Daily Beast feature, Ms Neubauer describes how she has gone through months of logistical haranging with the organization that she thought would protect her, at points being left feeling 'straight up suicidal'.

Turning on the turncoat: The Office of Special Investigations partnered with Jane Neubauer, who was 23 at the time, to work as an undercover informant but now they are building a case against her

The ordeal began on July 26, 2013 when Ms Neubauer went with a group of people she thought might have information about drug sales in and around Keesler Air Force Base in Biloxi, Mississippi.

She went with them to a party at a person's house that she did not know, and when she went upstairs to go to the restroom, she was raped by a man who claimed that he knew she was an informant.

She went to the local hospital and asked for a rape kit to be performed but told police that she did not want them to pursue an investigation.

In her mind, the OSI would carry out their own investigation since she was there as part of her undercover work.

Her supervisors immediately said that they would come to her defense- that they saw her 'like a sister' and would hunt down the man responsible.

As days went by, however, they stopped
 picking up her calls and she began to understand that they were 
building a case against her to charge that she made up her rape 
allegations.

The OSI is now
 claiming that they had a discussion with her the night before her 
alleged sexual assault wherein they decided that they would formally 
'cease' the informant partnership.

Betrayed: Ms Neubauer was first told that OSI would investigate her alleged rape but now they are charging her with crimes and have made no progress on her rape investigation, eight months later

They issued a statement to that effect to The Daily Beast reporter last week in late February, but they never provided the paperwork that would have been filed at the time if that timeline were true.

They went on to say that 'in like of the necessary investigative activities, her status as a victim' she had her role as a confidential informant formally terminated on August 7.

This wasn't the first sign that they were going to go after her, however. Just 12 days after the alleged assault, she was arrested by OSI for using marijuana.

Not long after, she was charged with DUI after marijuana was found in her car.

Those weren't the only charges filed against her: she was written up for wearing an unauthorized nail polish while in her dorm room.

'Once you have that target on your back it's coming from everywhere. She’s causing them too much work, it's too many problems,' said Jennifer Norris, a assault victim's advocate who is also a retired Air Force veteran.

Under watch: Neubauer was asked to dig for clues about the drug rings around the Air Force Base and her supervisors told her not to do any drugs but she could drink and break other rules; now they are charging her for that

According to Ms Neubauer, these are all steps that the OSI has taken to separate themselves from her and paint her in a bad light.

The most important distinction is that she says she was not told to stop her 3-month-long informant career only after the alleged rape.

As for the charges, she doesn't deny that they happened but does say that they are reneging on an earlier understanding by bringing them up.

When she was first recruited to become an informant- which came after she went to report a different incident when another airman made an inappropriate sexual remark- she says that her supervisors said it would be okay if she partook in some typically banned behavior in order to gain the trust of the drug dealers.

Secrecy: The OSI at Keesler Air Force Base near Biloxi, Mississippi has not revealed any evidence supporting their timeline of events, wherein they go against Ms Neubauer and say that they told her to stop her confidential work the day before her alleged rape

She told The Daily Beast that her OSI supervisor said: 'Just dirty yourself. Tell them you were a bad person before you joined the Air Force, tell them you miss smoking weed, tell them you miss doing pills.'

The alternative timeline from the OSI is the latest twist in the ongoing saga, and Ms Neubauer is technically still enrolled in the weather program at Keesler Air Force Base but she also still has the investigation looming over her head- an investigation that is different and separate from the drugs charges, for which she was sent to rehabilitation program.

Even though they have questioned her repeatedly, taken the rape kit results from the hospital and asked her for handwriting samples, they have still not told her what exactly they are investigating.
