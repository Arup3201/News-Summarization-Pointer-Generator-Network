They were briefly the most infamous couple in showbusiness. Now you could pass John Leslie and Abi Titmuss in the street without even knowing it.

A decade after his career was destroyed by unfounded sex allegations, the pair are both single and living at opposite ends of the country.

Former Blue Peter host Leslie, 48, has not worked on TV since he was named as the alleged rapist of presenter Ulrika Jonsson in 2002.

Worlds apart: John Leslie, pictured in Edinburgh and Abi Titmuss, in Hampstead, a decade on from their 15 minutes of fame

United front: Titmuss and Leslie were rarely out of the headlines ten years ago, but have since disappeared from the public eye

After a stint as a property developer,
 he now volunteers as a local radio DJ in Edinburgh. He lives alone in a
 bungalow at the edge of the city and catches the bus into town with 
other commuters.

Miss 
Titmuss, 37, made a fortune as a glamour model after the scandal and 
worked as a presenter on a porn channel. She has since reinvented 
herself as an actress, appearing in Casualty last year.

Wearing
 large glasses and no make-up as she walked her dog near her home in 
Hampstead, she was a far cry from the brash model who adorned the cover 
of magazines such as Nuts.

She and Leslie, who once dated Catherine Zeta-Jones, met in 1998Â  when she was a nurse and he was hosting ITV show This Morning.

Hand in hand: The couple look a world away in these shots after Leslie's name was cleared in 2003. The glamorous pair have since split

Supportive: Titmuss, who appeared in Nuts magazine at the time, looked on lovingly in 2003 as John Leslie's was cleared of indecent assault

Standing by her man: Titmuss was noted at the time for supporting Leslie amid accusations of sexual assault

In 2002, Miss Jonsson claimed in her autobiography she had been raped by a presenter. Leslie was wrongly named as that man on daytime TV, prompting his sacking.

The next year he was acquitted of two counts of indecently assaulting a 23-year-old actress in 1997.

Miss Titmuss stood by him, but they soon split. Then a sex video of them and another woman emerged amid reports they had taken cocaine.

In 2008 Leslie was arrested after more rape allegations but no charges were brought.
