It really is a dram fine tweed.

Two of Scotland's iconic brands - Johnnie Walker Black Label and Harris Tweed Hebrides - have collaborated to create a 'fabric of flavour', where the material smells of whisky.

The aroma will even be able to withstand dry cleaning.

The tweed is said to have key notes of 'rich malt, golden vanilla, red fruit and the trademark dark chocolate tones.'

Two of Scotland's iconic brands - Johnnie Walker Black Label and Harris Tweed Hebrides - have collaborated to create a 'fabric of flavour'

Months of development work, also involving Heriot Watt University, have resulted in a Harris Tweed design is supposed to reflect the colours of the whisky ingredients, while the fabric carries a unique scent - named Aqua Alba - based on the 'key notes of the nose of the liquid'.

Donald Macka, heads the finishing department at the Harris Tweed Hebrides mill in Shawbost, Isle of Lewis. 

It is the biggest maker of the Clo Mhor - meaning 'big cloth' in Gaelic - whose devotees include former Dr Who Matt Smith, Madonna and Gwyneth Paltrow.

Mr Macka said: 'I have worked with aromas in the past but they were only meant to withstand one dry clean.

'The process we have devised for Johnnie Walker means that this scent is layered into the fabric throughout the finishing process and is permanently imbued in the tweed'.

Jim McVee, business development manager at Heriot Watt's School of Textiles and Design, said: 'Smart textiles are a fast-developing sector that offers enormous potential. Our brief was to assist Harris Tweed Hebrides with the development of a tweed for Johnnie Walker that incorporates a micro-encapsulated fragrance.

Whisky aficionados will now be able to wrap up warm while simultaneously surrounding themselves with the smell of their favorite tipple 

'Fabric technologists in Galashiels developed the prototypes which will enable Harris Tweed Hebrides to offer products using this technology in future.

Mark Hogarth, creative director for Harris Tweed Hebrides, said that the idea stemmed from a shared recognition that premium Scotch Whisky and Harris Tweed have much in common in terms of 'provenance, complexity of the process and quality of finished blend'.

A range of products using Johnnie Walker Harris Tweed and the scent will be marketed around Europe starting with Germany, Greece and Belgium.  

The makers claim that the whisky aromas are infused into the cloth and can withstand dry cleaning 

The chairman of Harris Tweed Hebrides, former UK Trade Minister, Brian Wilson believes that the new material will be of great benefit to the Scottish economy. 

He said: 'This is a very natural partnership of two great Scottish brands with input from one of our cutting-edge academic centres. 

'The more of these partnerships we can promote, the better for the Scottish economy.

'The early indications are that the finished products are creating a high level of interest in the target markets'.
