It will be her first live performance of Skyfall – but it seems Adele’s appearance at the Oscars may not be entirely, well, live.

The singer has pre-recorded her awards night version of the James Bond theme as a ‘safety net’ ahead of the February 24 event.

The 24-year-old, who is tipped to win Best Original Song, recorded the track with a full orchestra in a Los Angeles studio last week.

An insider said: ‘Adele has every intention of singing live on the big night but, like every artist, she needs a back-up to avert disaster.

‘She will be singing live to a worldwide audience of a billion people and the pre-recording is a safety net in case something goes wrong on the night.’

Superstar Beyoncé was heavily criticised when it was revealed she lip-synched during her performance of the American national anthem at Barack Obama’s inauguration last month.

She later explained that freezing temperatures and a lack of rehearsal time led to her using a pre-recorded track.

She said: ‘I’m a perfectionist. I didn’t have time to prac-tise with the orchestra  so I did  not feel comfortable taking the risk.’
