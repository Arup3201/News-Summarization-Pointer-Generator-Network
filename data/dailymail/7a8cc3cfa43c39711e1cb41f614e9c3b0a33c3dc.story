Lewis Hamilton has cut ties with his boyhood team McLaren - pocketing a deal worth up to £60million in a move to the rival Mercedes Formula One team.

The British racing superstar will replace the retiring legend Michael Schumacher next season in a deal that will make him one of the sport's richest stars.

It will bring to an end the Briton’s 14-year association with McLaren, 
the team who sponsored him from when he was a 13-year-old karting 
prodigy.

'It is now time for me to take on a fresh challenge and I am very excited to begin a new chapter,' he said.

'Mercedes-Benz has such an incredible heritage in motorsport, along with a passion for winning which I share.

'Together, we can grow and rise to this new challenge,' the 27-year-old 
Hamilton added. 'I believe that I can help steer the Silver Arrows to 
the top and achieve our joint ambitions of winning the world 
championships.'

Hamilton had spent weeks denying that
he was leaving after news broke last month that he was considering a 
move away, after rumours of rifts with the team and regular mechanical 
problems.

It should earn him £45 million until 2016 plus a possible extra £15 million in bonuses.

It will also allow him more freedom to make more money from sponsorship.

McLaren, team principal Martin Whitmarsh paid tribute to the departing Hamilton.

He said: 'It’s entirely appropriate that I should take this opportunity 
to pass on our thanks to Lewis. He wrote a huge chapter of his life and 
career with us, and was, and always will be, a fine member of an 
exclusive club: the McLaren world champions’ club.'

McLaren have announced that Sauber driver Sergio Perez, 22, will replace Hamilton at the British outfit next season.

The Mexican, a member of the Ferrari driver academy, said: 'I’m thrilled and delighted to have become a Vodafone McLaren Mercedes driver.

'The McLaren name is one of the greatest in the history of Formula 1. For more than 40 years McLaren has been a team that every racing driver has aspired to drive for – I was brought up on the great stories of Ayrton Senna’s many world championship triumphs for McLaren – and I’m truly honoured that they’ve chosen me to partner Jenson from 2013 onwards,' he said.

Hamilton’s critics will say he is leaving for money but it is understood the offers on the table were similar. His basic Mercedes salary of around £15m — the same figure he is on at McLaren — will maintain his status as one of the grid’s top earners alongside Ferrari’s Fernando Alonso and possibly Red Bull’s Sebastian Vettel.

That said, Mercedes will  offer greater freedom than McLaren in letting Hamilton’s management company, Simon Fuller’s XIX Entertainment, to strike personal endorsements for their man.

More important than money — and Hamilton is known to be cautious with his finances — is his desire to improve on a return of one title in five completed seasons, a disappointing statistic for a driver who envisaged himself as a serial champion on his much-heralded arrival in Formula One.

2007 CANADIAN GRAND PRIXHamilton rewrote the record books during his rookie season as he finished on the podium in his first nine races. The Briton led from pole position and kept his cool during four safety car periods to win his first race in F1.

2008 MONACO GRAND PRIXHamilton was desperate to follow in the steps of his hero Ayrton Senna by standing on the top step of the podium at Formula One's most glamorous event. In wet conditions a sixth-lap brush with the barrier saw Hamilton suffer a puncture, but he recovered masterfully to claim victory.

2008 BRITISH GRAND PRIXAnother wet-weather masterclass from Hamilton. Having stormed through from fourth on the grid to pass team-mate Heikki Kovalainen during the early stages. The Briton simply destroyed the field to win by 68 seconds - the biggest winning margin in a grand prix since 1995.

2008 BRAZILIAN GRAND PRIXHamilton knew fifth place would guarantee him the title even if rival Felipe Massa won the race. But as the Ferrari driver romped to victory, Hamilton dropped to sixth shortly after pitting during a late-race shower. All hope appeared to be lost until the McLaren passed the Toyota of Timo Glock, struggling on dry-weather tyres, at the very last corner.

The will-he-won’t-he saga has captivated the sport for months but in the end the attraction of a fresh start, away from a team where he has always been treated with parental care, appears to have been too hard for the 27-year-old to resist.

The other governing factor was his desire for a championship-winning car. Whitmarsh always claimed that staying put represented the best chance of success, but the evidence for that assertion is patchy: though they are regular race winners, McLaren have won just a single drivers’ title since 1999.

The question is whether Mercedes, who have support at board level in Germany but are run from Brackley, Northamptonshire, are better equipped to deliver.  They have only been back in the sport as manufacturers since 2010, though in their previous guise as  Brawn won the title through Jenson Button.

Ross Brawn, the engineering svengali behind all seven of Schumacher’s titles, remains  team principal and his presence is sure to have been a major lure for Hamilton with significant changes to the engine regulations due for the 2014 season.

Brawn exploited a previous revamping of the technical blueprint in 2009, allowing Hamilton’s McLaren team-mate Button to waltz to his championship success. With Mercedes as engine makers, Brawn is well placed to conjure another trick.

Conversely, McLaren, who get their engines free from Mercedes as part of a long-term association, will have to pay for their supply from next year. That will put a strain on their budget.

Mercedes have won one race this season to McLaren’s five but it is probable that Hamilton would extract more from even this existing car than the 43-year-old Schumacher and his team-mate Nico Rosberg.

Hamilton is close to Norbert Haug, Mercedes’ head of motor sport, who often acted as an avuncular supporter of the young Briton back when the German manufacturers were in full partnership with McLaren.

As for Schumacher, he has been a shadow of his formerly dominant self since coming out of his first retirement in 2010. He has managed just one podium, this year in Valencia.
