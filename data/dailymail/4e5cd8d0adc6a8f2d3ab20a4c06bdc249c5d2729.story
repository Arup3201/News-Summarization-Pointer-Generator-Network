A Texan man killed by a great white shark in Australia was 'living his dream' his family has said as they paid tribute to the 32-year-old.

George 'Tom' Wainwright became the latest victim of a shark attack in the country when he sustained 'horrific' injuries as he went scuba diving off Rottnest Island, near Perth.

His father said that his family is so upset that they cannot face going to Australia to bring home his body.

George Wainwright Sr said that they 
are struggling to cope with the tragedy. 'It's something you're not able
to get your hands around,' he told the Houston Chronicle.

His family says George was living his dream while in Australia

Wainwright's uncle said that he had been doing what he loved as he went fishing and diving before the brutal attack.

'He was living the dream and he loved the ocean,' Mr Wainwright told the Syndey Morning Herald.

He said that his brother George and his wife Sharon had spoken to their son the night before he died.

'He really enjoyed it and called to say he had spent the night
on the beach and was going for a dive right there on the beach,' Mr 
Wainwright said.

The first pictures of Wainwright show a keen fisherman posing with his catches.

With a red snapper in each hand, he proudly displays his haul in photographs taken during his stay Australia on a work visa.

The state government has set tuna-baited hooks off the island in a bid to catch the shark and kill it.

Officials said Wainwright and two friends were diving from a 25-foot vessel, 500 yards north west of an area known as Little Armstrong Bay, when the 10-foot great white shark attacked.

They did not realise he was missing until bubbles emerged from the water and a short time later the man's body rose to
the surface with what were said by a local fisherman to be 'shocking 
injuries'.

Big haul: Wainwright, from Houston, had been in Perth on a work visa for six months before the attack yesterday

Wainwright's friends pulled him out of the water and police helped get him to shore, but he did not survive.Â 

Wainwright, a recreational diver, was from Houston, but had been living in a beachside suburb of Perth for the last six months or so. He had set his Facebook page to name the city as his location.

The shark struck just 11 miles from a 
popular Perth city mainland beach where a 64-year-old Australian swimmer is 
believed to have been taken by a great white on October 10.

That death came six weeks after a bodyboarder was killed by a shark and this latest death is the fourth from a great white shark 
in Australia's southwest corner in little over a year. Sharks kill fewer than one swimmer a year in Australia on average.

Despite fears of a rogue killer shark, experts say different ones are most likely responsible for the attacks.

Western Australia Premier Colin Barnett, the leader of the state government, said this shark will be hunted and killed if possible.

Fisheries officers have set tuna-baited hooks off the island, the first time authorities have used an emergency legal exemption from the state protection of great whites as an endangered species in the interests of protecting the public.

Mr Barnett also said his government would consider shark culls, responding to locals' complaints that shark numbers are increasing off bustling beaches in one of Australia's fastest growing population areas.

Referring to the three recent deadly attacks, Western Australia state Fisheries Minister Norman Moore said today: 'This is a unique set of circumstances, and I'm desperately praying this is not the beginning of a new trend and we're going to have these on a regular basis.'

Water Police Senior Sergeant Greg Trew said Wainwright had surfaced in 'a flurry of bubbles' with 'horrific' injuries.

Expat: Wainwright is believed to be the third person killed by a great white in the state in two months and the fourth in just over a year. Sharks kill fewer than one swimmer a year in Australia on average

Another death: This coastline by Perth is where the 64-year-old swimmer was killed by a shark on October 10

He was believed to be dead when hauled aboard by his two companions. Mr Trew said the shark was seen by Wainwright's friends as they were leaving the area after retrieving his body.

'It's traumatic for everyone involved, it's a tragic situation,' he added.

Authorities cannot say whether he was
killed by the same shark that is believed to have taken Bryn Martin as 
he made his regular morning swim from Perth's premier Cottesloe Beach 
toward a buoy about 380 yards offshore.

But
an analysis of Martin's torn swimming trunks recovered from the seabed 
near the buoy pointed to a great white shark being the culprit. No other
trace of Martin has been found.

'It's
a cloudy old day today which is the same as we had the other day with 
Cottesloe, and they're the conditions that sharks love,' Western 
Australia Police Sergeant Gerry Cassidy.

The unnamed American is the fourth person to be killed by a shark off the Western Australian coast in 14 months.

Last month, 21-year-old Kyle Burden was taken by a great white shark south of Perth and his lower torso was torn away.

In August last year surfer Nicholas Edwards, 31, killed was he was attacked by a great white at a popular surf break near Gracetown.

Great whites can grow to more than 20 feet in length and 5,000 pounds in weight. They are protected in Australia, a primary location for the species.

The Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh will attend the opening of the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in Perth on Friday October 28.
