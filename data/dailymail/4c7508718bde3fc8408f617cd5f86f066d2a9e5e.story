He may enjoy a Hollywood payday now and then, but that doesn't stop Jackie Chan from criticizing America.

'If you talk about corruption, the entire world, the United States has no corruption?' Chan asked the host.

Controversial: Chan, who's made millions in American films, called the country the most corrupt nation on the planet

Chan then referred to America as 'the most corrupt in the world.'

'Where does this Great 
Breakdown (financial crisis) come from? It started exactly from the 
world, the United States,' Chan told the interviewer. 'When I was interviewed in the U.S., people 
asked me, I said the same thing.

'I said now that China has become 
strong, everyone is making an issue of China,' continued the Rush Hour star. 'If our own countrymen 
don't support our country, who will support our country? We know our 
country has many problems. We [can] talk about it when the door is 
closed. To outsiders, [we should say] 'our country is the best.''

Chan is recognised as a long-time supporter of the ruling communist party in China.

According to the Washington Post, 'He is passionately political, a staunch defender of the Chinese 
Communist Party and harsh critic of anyone he sees as opposing Beijing. 
Today, that includes the United States.'

Outspoken: Chan has a history of making controversial political remarks such as calling Taiwan and Hong Kong examples of places that have been given too much freedom

The host then joked that Chan should be an ambassador to the U.S.

'Seriously, I am always like, when the door is closed, 'Our country is like this and this,'' Chan went on. ''Who and who is not good.' But outside, 'Our country is the best, like so and so, is the best.' You cannot say our country has problems [when you are outside], like 'Yes, our country is bad.''

Chan has a history of controversial political statements, such as calling Taiwan and Hong Kong examples of what happens when you have 'too much freedom.'

He also once said 'Chinese people need to be controlled, otherwise they will do whatever they want,' when discussing Chinese censorship of his movies.
