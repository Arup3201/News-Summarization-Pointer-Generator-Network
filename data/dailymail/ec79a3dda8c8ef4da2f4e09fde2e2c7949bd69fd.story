A thief has run off with $1million in rare coins from the State Library of New South Wales, including one of the earliest coins to have been struck in this country.

Sydney Police say the robbery occurred on Wednesday afternoon, when a man entered the public gallery on Macquarie Street and walked directly to the glass display cabinet.

Students and visitors were going about their normal business inside the library when the man broke open the display and stole the 12 rare and valuable Australian coins dating mostly from the 1850s to 1920s.

Among the pieces inside was the 1810 'Holey Dollar'.

The extremely rare 'Holey Dollar' which dates back to 1810 is among 12 rare and valuable coins which have been snatched from a public display at the State Library of New South Wales  

'We are saddened (that) a number of rare coins were stolen,' said Alex Byrne, the Library Chief Executive.

'15 Australian coins were on public display in a secure case – 12 were forcibly removed from the case.'

Coins worth more than $1million have been stolen from a public display at the State Library of New South Wales. Police believe the same man may have been responsible for a jewellery heist on a nearby hotel a short time later

Police are investigating the theft of precious coins worth more than $1million from the State Library of New South Wales

The State Library is next door to Parliament House on Macquarie Street in Sydney.

'We are deeply disappointed by this callous act of public vandalism,' said Mr Byrne.

Just 12 months ago, thieves in Adelaide got away with a private coin collection worth more than $200,000.

Sydney Police have spent the past day investigating the latest incident and also believe a second nearby theft later that day may be connected. Two hours after the robbery at the State Library, a man walked into a hotel on George Street and walked up to a glass cabinet.

He broke that open and stole four sets of diamond earrings, three diamond rings and a gold pendant from the display.

These items are valued at about $75,000.
