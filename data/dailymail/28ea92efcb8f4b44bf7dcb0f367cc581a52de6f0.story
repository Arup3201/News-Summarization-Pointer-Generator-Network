Delayed mail: A love letter written to Muhammed Siddeeq turned up more than 50 years later, long after he had married and then divorced its sender

A love letter intended for a US college student turned up in his mailbox more than 50 years after it was sent - and decades after he had married and then divorced its writer.

Muhammed Siddeeq was a student at the California University of Pennsylvania in 1958 when his then girlfriend Vonnie wrote the heartfelt note.

But the letter didn't reach Siddeeq until he was aged 74 and by that stage he had married Vonnie, had four children together and gone through a bitter divorce in the 1960s.

The note found its way to Siddeeq despite the fact that he changed his name from Clark Moore in the 1970s when he converted to Islam and had changed address several times.

The extraordinary delay in delivering the piece of mail has found its way into the latest edition of Ripley's Believe It Or Not.

At the time of the letter, Vonnie was living in Pittsburgh almost 60km from where Siddeeq was studying.

According to USA Today, she wrote: 'I still miss you as much as ever and love you a thousand times more.'

She signed it: 'Love Forever, Vonnie.'

Although the pair corresponded regularly, the letter got lost in the post.

But it eventually found its way into the California University of Pennsylvania mailbox more than five decades later and ended up in Siddeeq's possession when someone contacted the university having seen a news report about it on television.

According to Ripley however, the delay is not a world record, with several other pieces of mail taking long to reach their target destination.

Although the couple have long been divorced, the letter did serve one purpose according to Siddeeq.

He said: 'For the first time the kids could see that their mother and I, at one time, had a good, loving relationship which is important for them to know.'

Siddeeq, a retired maths and science teacher, became a public figure when he pushed for an investigation into the shooting of a 16-year-old boy in police custody in Indianapolis in 1987.

He was also a spiritual adviser to boxer Mike Tyson in the 1990s during his jail term for rape.
