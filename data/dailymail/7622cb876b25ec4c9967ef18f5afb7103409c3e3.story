Police are searching for a man with a 'large and heavy' suitcase after confirming they are now treating the disappearance of a teenage girl as a murder inquiry.

Jayden Parkinson, 17, from Oxford, was last seen leaving Didcot Parkway train station in south Oxfordshire on December 3 and hasn't been seen since.

Yesterday police revealed their missing person investigation is now a murder inquiry - despite no body having yet been found.

Police were today combing a field near Upton as part of the investigation, and were urging members of the public not to organise their own searches for the teenager.

Superintendent Christian Bunt said the investigation was focusing on the village of Upton and a grassed area off Lydalls Road in Didcot.

'We are continuing with our extensive search with our missing person enquiry,' he told Sky News.

'I would like to thank the public firstly as there's a huge amount of information coming in and a lot of vital lines of enquiry we are following. Please keep that information forthcoming.

'We have got two significant search areas at the moment. We continue to focus on the area in Upton just outside of Didcot and we understand that is having a big impact on the local community.

'It's quite an extensive search area and we have got lots of officers there and we now have a fairly significant search area in the Lydalls Road area of Didcot.

'We've got a lot of resources attached to the operation, over 100 officers, specialist search and investigative officers and it's also important to mention we have specialist officers with the family supporting them.

Police have arrested two men on suspicion of attempted murder in connection with the disappearance of 17-year-old Jayden Parkinson, pictured

A 22-year-old, believed to be the boyfriend of the teen (pictured), and a 17-year-old are both being held by Thames Valley Police

'I understand the communities, particularly in the Didcot and the Upton areas, are affected by this operation.'

A spokesman for Thames Valley Police 
said a 17-year-old boy had walked into a police station in Oxfordshire 
on Friday afternoon and was arrested on the spot on suspicion of murder.

Another
 22-year-old man - believed to be her boyfriend - was arrested at his 
home in Reading and remains in police custody on suspicion of murder.

Police have said that he was 'in a relationship' with Jayden but would not say how long the pair had known each other.

Detectives have said that they are now searching for Jayden's body after she disappeared on December 3.

Detective
 Chief Superintendent Andy Murray said police were now focusing on 
trying to find a man who was seen with a large suitcase in a field in 
the small village of Upton in the early hours of December 9.

'That
 suitcase was large, it was heavy, it was difficult to manage and that 
man was having difficulty removing that suitcase from that area,' he 
said.

Mr Murray said the same man with the suitcase was seen in nearby Didcot about half an hour later.

Warning: Police have urged members of the public not to organise their own searches as they could jeopardise the investigation

Scene: A forensics tent, guarded by a uniformed officer, has been put up in a field at the centre of the search

The man has been described as about 
20, white, about 5'6' tall of medium to slim build, with short dark 
hair. The suitcase was about 3' by 2' and about 15' deep and light 
coloured, probably made of canvas material.

Mr
 Murray said police were also searching addresses Jayden 'may be 
associated with'. Police also uncovered a recycling bin in Didcot to try
 to find evidence, he said.

Mr
 Murray said officers were certain the man spotted in Upton with the 
suitcase was the same man seen shortly after in Didcot, but could not 
say why.

He said Jayden's family were still hoping for the best.

'As you might imagine, they are distraught,' he said.

'They've still got hope but they are distraught and they want their daughter to come home.'

Hunt: A police cordon and a pair of floodlights could be seen in a field near Upton

Probe: Police say approximately 50 detectives are searching for Jayden

But
 Mr Murray said the fact Jayden had not used her phone or accessed her 
bank account since the disappearance could indicate a worse scenario.

'I'm
 afraid the detective in me leads me to conclude that Jayden may well 
have been murdered and that's why we have approximately 50 detectives 
out there still trying to find Jayden, still trying to find evidence 
that might lead to somebody being convicted if she has been murdered,' 
he said.

Senior police 
officers today warned members of the public not to organise their own 
searches for the missing teenager, as they could jeopardise the police 
investigation.

Supt Bunt said: 'At this stage it is a critical time in our investigation in to the disappearance of Jayden Parkinson. There are currently a number of search scenes in the Didcot and the surrounding locality. We appreciate the public’s co-operation and understanding while this takes place.

'Due to the nature of the police searches taking place we would request the public refrain from organising their own search activity at this stage to avoid the risk of jeopardising the investigation.

Scene:
 Jayden had moved out of her family home in Didcot 'a matter of weeks' 
before she vanished from a youth hostel in Oxford called 1 Foot Forward 
(on this road), around mid-afternoon

'We continue to appreciate the 
public’s help and support and continue to appeal for anyone with any 
information to contact us on 101.'

Jayden is white, of slim build with shoulder-length dark brown hair and brown eyes.

She
 was wearing light blue faded jeans, a brown hooded top with red 
lettering on it, a black waist-length jacket, and dark trainers when she
 was last seen.

It is 
believed she walked up the High Street through the town centre, arriving
 at Oxford train station at 4.07pm, where she boarded a train to Didcot.
 The last sighting of her is when she left Didcot train station at about
 4.27pm.

Yesterday, 
officers were seen investigating close to a disused railway line between
 Upton and Didcot following an 'incident' there.

The teen lived with her mother Samantha, pictured, in Didcot, Oxon

Mr Murray said: 'There was an incident in that area on the evening of December 8 leading into December 9.

'Something
 suspicious happened. I can't go into any detail, but if there's anyone 
who was out and about in that area that night and saw something 
suspicious, we ask them to get in touch with us.'

Jayden,
 who was nicknamed Tiny by her mother, had moved out of her family home 
in Didcot 'a matter of weeks' before she vanished from the Oxford hostel.

The youngster left school last summer 
after taking her GCSEs and was not believed to be studying or in 
employment at the time of her disappearance. 

She was said to have often changed her hair colour.

Until recently, she had lived with her mother, Samantha Shrewsbury, and her sister in Didcot.

Her worried mother had posted various messages on Facebook in the last week.

One
 message posted today - before news of the murder arrest - said: 'To my 
Tiny, Princess listen you are not in any trouble at all, we all just 
want to know you are safe and well babe plz plz if you are able to 
contact anyone even if it’s to say pee off I’m ok just please please let
 us know ur ok xxx.'
