London Olympics bosses received £2.8million in pay-offs despite knowing their jobs would end after the 2012 Games.

All 144 people who left the Olympic Delivery Authority last year received redundancy pay as the agency was wound down.

Four executives received £261,000 in exit payments after leaving within months of the closing ceremony last summer.

Pay-offs: Every person who left the Olympic Delivery Authority last year received redundancy pay, despite knowing their jobs would not last beyond the 2012 Games

The pay-offs will raise questions about the use of public money because all of the recipients will have known their jobs were not going to last far beyond the London 2012 Games.

The ODA insisted the payments were necessary because senior managers gave up lucrative jobs elsewhere ‘with no certainty of the project's success or getting a job after the Games’.

According to the annual accounts of the ODA, a total of 144 people received redundancy pay-outs in the last year.

Three people left with pay-offs worth £70,000-£80,000, two received between £50,000-£60,000 and two between £40,000 and £50,000. Almost half received between £10,000 and £20,000.

Golden goodbye: Dennis Hone left as chief executive of the ODA with an £80,000 golden goodbye - and became head of the London Legacy Development Corporation

Matthew Sinclair, chief executive of the TaxPayers' Alliance, said: 'It beggars belief that the Olympics quango employed staff on permanent contracts .

'Taxpayers' money has been wasted on payouts that were entirely avoidable had staff contracts reflected the fact that working on the Olympics was quite obviously a temporary role.

'The utter disregard shown for value for taxpayers' money by Olympics chiefs is both shocking and worrying, especially as the government are holding up the Olympics as an example of how to manage big infrastructure projects.'

Dennis Hone, the ODA chief executive, received £929,000 in pay, bonuses and pensions during just two years in the job.

He left with a pension pot worth £1.9million. He was made redundant at the end of March, with a golden goodbye worth £80,000, as well as an immediate pension of £373,000.

But he walked into a new job as chief executive of the London Legacy Development Corporation.

According to the accounts Mr Hone was entitled to receive statutory redundancy pay and a pay-off bonus equivalent worth 60 per cent of his £233,000 salary.

It was agreed he would receive a lower
‘terminal bonus’ of 49 per cent of his salary and half of it will only 
be paid once the sale is completed on the East Village, the athlete’s 
village which is being turned into homes, schools and shops.

The
ODA's director of transport, Hugh Sumner, also received £73,000 in exit
payments, on top of his £189,000 salary, £35,000 bonus and £23,000 
employer’s pension contribution.

Simon Wright, director of venues and infrastructure, received a golden goodbye worth £72,000 when he left the ODA in November.

During seven months he earned £151,000 salary, a £35,000 bonus and £18,000 towards his pension.

Director
of human resources Wendy Cartwright, who earned £177,000 last year in 
pay, bonuses and pension, received £36,000 in exit payment.

The
ODA insisted that only Mr Hone received extra cash, with all other 
staff given statutory redundancy pay, any leave they were unable to take
before their employment ended, and, where appropriate, payment in lieu 
of notice.

A spokesman added: ‘London 2012 was a unique and challenging project and a great British success story and we needed to recruit and pay for the best talent from the private and public sectors, requiring people in many cases to give up secure long-term jobs elsewhere, with no certainty of the project's success or getting a job after the Games.

‘We had to adopt a flexible approach to managing staff contracts to ensure that key people, especially directors, remained with the project throughout periods critical to its success, until such time as the ODA could be certain that their skills and knowledge were no longer required. Our staff delivered this huge project on time and under budget - in fact making savings of over £1 billion for the public purse.

‘Like other staff, Dennis Hone received performance-related pay, but this was far from guaranteed and was measured against tough performance criteria, evaluated personally and in relation to the organisation he successfully led in the critical 18 months up to the Games, during London 2012 and immediately after.

‘Pension payments made in relation to Dennis Hone were legal and contractual obligations under the scheme of which he was a member throughout his employment at the ODA.’
