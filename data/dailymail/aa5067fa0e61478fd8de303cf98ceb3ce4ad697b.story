Divine intervention: Stephanie Hamman, 23, crashed her car into Providence Church Sunday night claiming God told her to do it

A 23-year-old woman claiming to be possessed by the devil crashed her car into a church in Church Hill, Tennessee before proceeding to stab her husband in the chest for 'worshiping NASCAR'.

Now former high-school cheerleader Staphanie Peery Hamman is facing charges for the damage she did to the church and trying to kill her husband.

After her arrest Sunday night, Hamman explained to police that she drove through Providence Church's front doors when she found the building locked and wanted to drop off some items.

'God told me He wanted me in there, so I drove my car through the doors. God told me to, so I did it,' she told police.

After driving through the doors, Hamman put the items on the altar and then called her husband to tell him she wrecked her Toyota.

Husband Steven Hamman was just across the street at their apartment watching the NASCAR race, and ran over to check on Stephanie.

When he arrived he found his wife laying in front of the altar, but when he approached she said 'the devil is in me' and then stabbed him in the right side of the chest with a large kitchen knife.

Hamman told police she brought the knife with her because the devil told her to.

'I prayed I would not have to use it on him, but I did,' she said.

Steven pulled the knife out himself and then fled the church back to the apartment where he waited for paramedics to arrive.

Breaking in: Hamman told police she drove through the church's front doors when she found them locked and needed to get in to drop off some items

Twenty minutes after the incident was
 reported around 10pm, police found Hamman at the Holston Valley 
Hospital and Medical Center, where she claimed to have been dropped off by relatives.

They arrested her on the scene and she went on to describe what propelled her to stab her husband.

According
 to the police report, Hamman 'felt her husband Steven was worshiping 
the NASCAR race at Bristol, which made her mad, and she began having 
thoughts that the devil put in her head.'

She also talked at length about her love for smoking marijuana.

'I
 smoke a bunch of week, I love to smoke it. Sometimes when I do, I start
 seeing things that others don't. Isn't God good? He told me that this 
would happen and just look, I am okay,' she said.

But
 she also said that God had told her to stop smoking marijuana 'all day 
and all night' and that she should only 'smoke it at night to help her 
relax'.

Hamman said that she had been baptized at Providence Church that morning, a claim that the church's pastor refuted.

Call for help: She then called her husband to tell her she wrecked her car. He was across the street at their apartment watching a NASCAR race at the time

Possessed: Steven Hamman said he arrived to find his wife lying in front of the altar. She said 'the devil is in me' before stabbing him in the right side of the chest with a large kitchen knife

Kept apart: Steven Hamman pulled the knife out himself and fled to get medical attention. As of Monday he was in fair condition while his wife was behind bars without bond

'One of the statements she apparently has made was that she attended this church, and she was baptized here on Sunday - which is incorrect. We've never known her to even visit here, and certainly didn't have a baptism here yesterday," Providence Church Pastor Joel Trigg told WJHL.

However, authorities believe she may have been baptized at another church in Scott County, Virginia that day.

Hamman was arrested and transported to Hawkins County Jail where she was reportedly being held without bond.

As of Monday afternoon, Steven Hamman was in fair condition at the hospital.

Pastor Triggs went in to check on Steven and told WATE 'he seemed to be doing OK'.

'Again, our hearts really go out to them, 'Pastor Trigg said. 'We can sustain some damage to our building, we know in our church ministry is not really about buildings, it's about people.

Pastor Trigg says the church's front doors were torn down in the crash and two water fountains were knocked off the wall.

Hamman is facing charges of first degree murder and felony vandalism.Â
