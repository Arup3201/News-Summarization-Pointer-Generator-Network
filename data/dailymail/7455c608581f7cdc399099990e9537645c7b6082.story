A French comedian who joked about the Charlie Hebdo massacres told a court yesterday he 'condemned the attacks without reservation'.

Dieudonne M'bala M'bala, 48, was in the dock at the Palais de Justice in central Paris charged with inciting terrorism, as prosecutors called for a fine equivalent to £22,000.

But the controversial entertainer denied any wrongdoing and said the case exposed the hypocrisy of a country which 'pretends' to be a bastion of free speech.

Comedian: Dieudonne M'bala M'bala appeared to sympathise with terrorist Amedy Coulibaly, who killed four people at a kosher supermarket in Paris last month and also murdered a policewoman

Staff working for the French satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo were targeted for publishing insulting cartoons of the Prophet Muhammad and for insulting Muslims generally.

'Je suis Charlie' (I am Charlie) has since become the French government-backed rallying cry for those who support the magazine, but Dieudonne says this displays double-standards.

In a Facebook post last month, he appeared to sympathise with terrorist Amedy Coulibaly, who killed four  people at a kosher supermarket in Paris and also murdered a policewoman.

Dieudonne, who has convictions for anti-Semitism, said his humour was no different to Charlie Hebdo's.

He wrote: 'Tonight, as far as I'm concerned, I feel like Charlie Coulibaly.'

Defence: Dieudonne M'bala M'bala's barrister Sanjay Mirabeau

The comedian told the court yesterday that he 'condemned the attacks without reservation and without any ambiguity'.

His defence barrister, Sanjay Mirabeau said Dieudonne's arrest in January was disproportionate, yet it was followed by police questioning more than 70 others for similar alleged crimes.

Mr Mirabeau said the case against his client should be thrown out 'because it is the job of humourists to make people laugh'.

President Francois Hollande's government ordered a major clampdown on hate speech following the terrorist attacks, which left a total of 20 people dead, including Coulibaly and two other terrorists.

Dieudonne drew international attention last year when football star Nicolas Anelka celebrated an English Premiership goal with a salute popularised by the comic which critics said was anti-Semitic.

Called a 'quenelle', it has been described as a reverse Nazi salute, and was used by Anelka while he was playing for West Bromwich Albion. 

Al Qaeda in Yemen claimed responsibility for the Paris attacks, but intelligence officials believe the terror group provided inspiration, rather than any logistical or financial support.

Since the attacks, France has deployed 10,000 troops and 120,000 security forces to protect sensitive sites, including synagogues, mosques and travel hubs.

Judges today began deliberating on their verdict on the Dieudonne case and it will be handed down at a later date.
