It’s great Steven Gerrard is contemplating a move to the MLS, for him and the game in America. I have been out in the U.S. with Portland Timbers for half a season and loved every second.

You can relax and enjoy a calm way of life. Stevie would have gone out in Liverpool and been asked for pictures and autographs but will be able to walk around whichever city he choses in relative anonymity.

I can understand if he goes for LA Galaxy. We played there last season and were able to go out on the beach the day before the game as people went rollerblading up and down. What better way to spend your remaining years?

Liam Ridgewell says it's a great move for Gerrard and the MLS that he is contemplating a move 

He could probably play on for another two years in the Premier League, so it is an indication of how much the MLS has grown that he would think about joining. It is a complement to the league. 

David Beckham and Thierry Henry have paved the way and he can create just as big an impression. He is a Premier League great and his presence will only bring the MLS on again. There will be more interest in England and highlights every time he scores.

People may think Americans are only interested in sports like baseball and the NFL, but the fans at football matches are fantastic. 

They will tailgate for hours before kick-off and create atmospheres like English derbies every time. They bounce and sing for 90 minutes. Coming from Anfield, Stevie will like that.

I’ve been able to explore Portland, a quirky city I would never have seen otherwise, live by a lake and spend afternoons chilling out on my boat, and get right into American fantasy football. 

Stevie should come over with his family and get the experience too.
