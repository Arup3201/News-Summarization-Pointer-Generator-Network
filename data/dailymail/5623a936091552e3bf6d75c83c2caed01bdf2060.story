A UFO that resembled a flying horse has been spotted close to one of Mexico's most active volcanoes.

The dark object appeared to have two legs and was seen hovering into view out of nowhere as volcano Colima, 300 miles west of Mexico City, spewed out smoke.

Captured on webcam after Colima erupted this week, the enigmatic 'equine' vanished moments later.

Mexican authorities are investigating after a UFO was spotted close to erupting volcano Colima - situated between the western Mexican states of Colima and Jalisco

Witness Loyola Quintanilla Rosas, 24, said: 'When I first saw it, I thought it looked like a horse.

'It had a very large body and seemed to be an animal. It had a thin top, a bulging middle and two extremities at the bottom.

'But the legs weren't moving so it clearly wasn't a modern-day Pegasus.'

'And it sure as hell wasn't a bird,' Loyola added. 

UFO hunters have said they think it could be an alien vessel and made reference to previous sightings at volcanic eruptions in Mexico.

In 2012, a 'cigar-shaped' object was filmed flying inside Popocatepetl volcano in central Mexico by a television camera crew.

And last November, a 'blurry, white object' was caught on camera flying around the same volcano. 

The dark horse-shaped object appeared to have two legs and was seen coming into view out of nowhere before quickly disappearing

The unidentified object was captured on webcam and posted on Twitter

A witness, Loyola Quintanilla Rosas, said the object at first looked like a horse with a big body- adding, 'It sure as hell wasn't a bird'

Alien enthusiast Eufrasio Gonzales Carrasco, 35, said: 'There has been a fair bit of activity around these volcanoes and this latest sighting just adds to the mystery.

'There must be something about volcanoes that draws extra-terrestrials to them. Perhaps they are collecting samples from our planet to take back home.'

A spokesman from Mexico's Civil Protection of the Ministry of Interior said: 'It is most likely a drone of some sort. We are looking into it.'
