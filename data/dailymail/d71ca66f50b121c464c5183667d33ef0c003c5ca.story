Zzzzp! goes the machine, quietly. Yeeeeow! screech the nerve endings in my cheeks as yet another searing rush of ultrasound energy whizzes through them.

'Are we still friends?' questions cosmetic nurse Esther Loughran, as she hands me a mirror to survey how much difference her 'miracle machine' has made to my face.

We are still friends, but only because the agonising pain has stopped. I can't, however, guarantee that will be the case when the machine is switched back on.

Ulthera isthe latest non-surgical face-lifting device that claims to 'shrink-wrap' your face from the inside, tightening sagging skin and kick-starting the growth of new collagen

I'm at Dr Rita Rakus's swish London clinic trying out something called Ulthera - the latest non-surgical face-lifting device that claims to 'shrink-wrap' your face from the inside, tightening sagging skin and kick-starting the growth of new collagen.

It's loved by a host of stars including Friends actress Courteney Cox, and the before-and-after pictures on the company's website look impressive. Even the notoriously hard-to-please U.S. health watchdog, the Food and Drug Administration, likes Ulthera, deeming it the only non-invasive procedure to lift the skin on the neck, chin and brow.

But here's the hitch: Ulthera is exceptionally painful.

Painful enough to make a bunch of hardened beauty junkies - women who think nothing of having Botox without anaesthetic and barely flinch when their skin is flayed with a laser - literally weep.

Just last week, a colleague (who  is no wimp) left this same clinic  in tears, unable to complete  the treatment.

Despite its efficacy - and its undoubted money-spinning potential - I know two cosmetic doctors who trialled the machine and decided they would never inflict that level of pain on their patients ('Everyone said it was horrific, excruciating,' says one).

In the U.S., clinics routinely prescribe their patients Valium before the treatment or even sedate them. So you will understand my apprehension, despite Esther's reassurances that most people are 'fine' with the machine.

'Comfort levels vary from patient to patient,' says the leaflet about the treatment. 'There can be some discomfort, but this is a sign that the collagen-building process has been initiated.'

Having not been prescribed Valium, I've made do with taking doses of ibuprofen and paracetamol beforehand.

The face is divided into sections for the treatment and so I've asked that we start under my chin, which is most in need of help - just in case that's all I can take.

Esther explains that unlike lasers, which zap the surface of the skin, Ulthera uses ultrasound waves to heat something called the SMAS (superficial muscular aponeurotic system), the muscle-like layer of tissue under the skin.

'When you add heat to this muscle 
layer it contracts and tightens,' says Esther. 'It is what plastic 
surgeons do in theatre when performing a facelift.

'The heat also leaves a thermal coagulation point, or TCP, which will produce new collagen over the next three months.

Collagen
 production is also stimulated on the lower levels of the skin, meaning 
there is an instant tightening and lifting effect.'

With
 a white make-up pencil, Esther marks out the zones on my face and neck 
that she's going to treat before firing up the Ulthera machine.

At
 first, it feels fine, just a light prickling sensation and so I start 
to relax a bit. But then she starts working on my cheeks. All I can say 
is yeeeow!

I know what you're thinking - that ultrasound is a gentle, comfortable thing, safe enough to be used to scan pregnant tummies - and so it is.

'At first, it feels fine, just a light prickling sensation and so I start to relax a bit. But then she starts working on my cheeks. All I can say is yeeeow'

But when its waves are concentrated in a slightly different way, it becomes a different tool entirely.

The
 thing about pain is that everyone's threshold is different, and indeed 
varies from day-to-day. I know if I'm tired, or had one too many glasses
 of wine the night before, even having my legs waxed feels excruciating.

I've tried a lot of beauty treatments 
and, over the years, have graded them into a pain-scale ranging from 
Botox (which rates at about a two - it's a series of tiny jabs and 
really doesn't hurt) to having semi-permanent eyeliner tattooed along my
 upper eyelash line (about a nine - intensely painful though also 
mercifully quick).

French women spend twice as much as British ladies on anti-ageing creams

Waxing, 
I'd rate at about five. To begin with, Ulthera was a manageable three or
 four, but it quickly rises to an agonising eight, causing me to screw 
up my face and drum my heels on the couch.

'Try not to fight it,' says Esther soothingly. 'It makes it worse.'

'Maybe relax your shoulders,' adds Tracey, the publicist, who is watching. 'At least it's not as bad as childbirth.'

'Try deep breathing,' suggests Juliette, the photographer.

So I attempt some of the focused breathing that I've been learning in yoga, which helps distract me a bit, until the next zzzp of ultrasound cuts me off mid-flow and we all get the giggles and start comparing birthing stories. I end up feeling a bit hysterical.

We take a break and Esther hands me a 
mirror. I'm amazed to find that already my jawline looks more taut, and 
my whole cheek looks lifted on the side that has been treated. So only 
one cheek's worth to go!

By
 now, I'm feeling fairly gung-ho, as I know we're nearly finished. I try
 a more meditative approach to pain control, imagining I'm on a warm, 
peaceful beach and that the flickering stabs from Esther cross-hatching 
lines on my other cheek are happening somewhere else.

The whole treatment takes the best part of an hour - it would have been longer, but thanks to prominent veins in my forehead, that area can't be treated (alas, as I was hoping for a quick brow-lift into the bargain).

But I've still absorbed some 400 lines of ultrasound waves. I'm glad I didn't know how many there were before we started.

And then I go home feeling a bit 
spaced out from all the endorphins (the feel-good chemicals that the 
body produces at times of stress or pain). Because the treatment works 
below the skin's surface, there is no downtime.

My
 skin is a little red, but this goes within an hour, and the treated 
areas feel stiff inside, as if the muscles have had a fearsome workout. I
 think my jawline looks more defined than it did, but it will be months 
until the full results show.

So,
 yes, I fear this is the most painful treatment you're likely to find. 
The question then is why would anyone submit themselves to this? Because
 it works and the pain is fleeting.

Would I do it again? For sure! Especially if I could get hold of some Valium ...
