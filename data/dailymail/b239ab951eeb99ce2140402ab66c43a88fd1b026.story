It's not just her fancy footwork that is helping her to shed pounds, it's her leggings too.

Strictly Come Dancing contestant Lisa Riley has shed a stone and plenty of inches in almost two months and revealed yesterday her staple item of clothing for training is helping.

Just like former X Factor judge Dannii Minogue, Pamela Anderson and Kirsty Alley, Miss Riley, 36, is now a fan of Proskins Slim leggings which apparently combat cellulite, reduce inches and get rid of excess fluid by stimulating the lymphatic system.

Miss Riley - who attended the Pride of Britain awards last night with her Strictly dance partner Robin Windsor, and looked stunning in a floor-length patterned blue dress - has been wearing her 
leggings for up to eight hours a day.

She recently tweeted praise for 
them, saying: 'I ADORE my pro skin leggings, they are amazing and make my legs 
look a lot smaller than they are! I would recommend them xxx'

Makers
of the Proskins Slim leggings say the compression fabric works in a 
similar way to high-tech sportswear, giving legs a steady, firm pressure
which they claim improves blood flow.

This helps stop fat cells from sticking to connective tissue in the thighs and bottom, a cause of cellulite, and fight fluid retention around the calves and ankles.

Caffeine woven into the fabric smooths and plumps the skin, reducing the ‘orange peel’ effect, they add. Independent tests by French firm Dermascan found wearers lost up to 2cm off their thighs.

The leggings which are available for £50 online are also best-sellers at Tesco and Next.
