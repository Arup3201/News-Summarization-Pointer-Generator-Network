A beauty therapist who posted dozens of 'selfie' pictures of her new slimline figure on Facebook said she was shocked and upset after being reported to the website for encouraging 'nudity'.

Alyson Larkin, 33, gorged on junk food and fizzy drinks for years and saw her weight soar due to her unhealthy lifestyle.

After failing to fit into her trousers before a holiday to Australia in 2012, the mother-of-one decided to change her life and set about transforming her body - losing three stone in less than a year.

She regularly took to Facebook to document her changing physique  but was reduced to tears after an anonymous 'nudity' complaint was made to the website about a photo in which she is wearing normal gym attire.

Photo that prompted complaint: Alyson Larkin, 33, received a notification telling her that this photo of her in gym attire had been complained about by another Facebook user due to its level of 'nudity'

The mother-of-one said: 'It actually made me cry as I felt hurt that people think I would do something wrong. How anyone could say that picture was encouraging nudity is beyond me.'

Ms Larkin, of Inverclyde, Scotland, had lived on microwave meals and takeaways during her worst days - while drinking five cans of coke and downing a glass of wine every day.

After realising some of her clothes no longer fit her, she embarked on a strict health mission - even selling her Vauxhall Corsa so that she was forced to walk everywhere.

In less than a year, she lost three stone and dropped three dress sizes as well as joining an online weight loss programme which encourages people to eat healthily and exercise.

Showing off: Ms Larkin said she is extremely proud of the way that she has transformed her body

Describing her Facebook weight loss pictures, she added: 'I'm not interested in promoting skinny bodies from fad diets. 

'I'm just showing people how I look after changing my own lifestyle to one of eating healthy meals and regular exercise.'

Ms Larkin received a message from Facebook notifying her an anonymous complaint had been made about one picture.

The message said: 'Someone has reported your photo for displaying nudity.'

The 'selfie' image showed a before and after image she had taken showing herself when she was heavier and how she appears now.

She added: 'I post a lot of pictures of myself but that's because I've got them on my phone so it's easier to do, anyone who knows me in real life will know that I'm just pretty normal and have a smile for every person I meet.

Series of selfies: Ms Larkin took to Facebook to document her progress in her mission to lose weight

Messages of support: Since the complaint became public knowledge, the mother has been flooded with messages from friends complimenting her 'beautiful' figure 

'I won't stop posting my pictures because of a minority. For every person who doesn't like it there's ten more message me on a daily basis to say they're great.

'I am proud of my body, I work hard at it and if I want to show people where a wee bit of hard work can get you I will.

'So my message for anyone who doesn't like it is delete me from Facebook and don't look at it.'

Dozens of messages of support for Aly were left on her Facebook page by outraged friends.

Bernadette Gillan said: 'They're just jealous honey you look beautiful, very proud of you. I love seeing your pictures, you work hard xxxxxxx.'

Michelle Brown wrote: 'You shouldn't feel like you have to explain yourself and you certainly should be bloody proud of your body, you look fantastic and work hard for it! Xx.'

Fitness regime: She embarked on the health mission after discovering she could no longer fit into her trousers - and even sold her car so that she would be forced to walk everywhere

Allowed to stay online: The new fitness fanatic received a notification saying her photo had not been removed by Facebook moderaters despite being the subject of a complaint

Andrea McAuley added: 'You should be proud you fitty! And fair play to you for promoting a healthy body image/confidence and hard work. Don't let others get you down. Chin up buttercup and stick at it.'

Facebook rules state: 'Facebook has a strict policy against the sharing of pornographic content and any explicitly sexual content where a minor is involved.

'We also impose limitations on the display of nudity. We aspire to respect people's right to share content of personal importance, whether those are photos of a sculpture like Michelangelo's David or family photos of a child breastfeeding.

'If you see something on Facebook that you believe violates our terms, you should report it to us. Please keep in mind that reporting a piece of content does not guarantee that it will be removed from the site.

'For this reason, we also offer personal controls over what you see, such as the ability to hide or quietly cut ties with people, pages, or applications that offend you.' 

Upset: Ms Larkin said she cried when she found out that someone had reported her Facebook photos for being inappropriate - adding 'wow anyone could say that picture was encouraging nudity is beyond me'

On a mission: The mother said 'I won't stop posting my pictures because of a minority. For every person who doesn't like it there's ten more message me on a daily basis to say they're great'
