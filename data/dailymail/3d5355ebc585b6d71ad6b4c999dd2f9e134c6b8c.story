Wimbledon might be the sporting event of the British summer season but this year’s tournament has so far failed to serve any surprises.

But there has been one attraction causing a stir amongst female tennis fans: Kim Sears’s hair.

Andy Murray’s 26-year-old girlfriend may cut a reserved — some might even say dull — figure in the stands, but her lustrous, sun-kissed locks have become a Wimbledon star in their own right.

The so-called ‘Kim cut’ — a soft cascade of glossy, caramel-hued tresses — has inspired such awe and admiration that a top London hair salon is currently offering wannabe tennis Wags the chance to recreate Kim’s signature look. 

As a 42-year-old mum whose chin-length bob is as flat as Centre Court, this offer is irresistible.

Admittedly, the Kim makeover costs an eye-watering £1,000 — enough to make a dent in even a champion’s prize money — but if it can transform my hair into a head-turning Wimbledon winner, surely it’s worth it?

I head to Vixen & Blush, a salon specialising in hair extensions in London’s trendy Hoxton. While it’s thought Kim’s hair is all her own, I’m going to need to cheat a little.

There I meet owner Sarah McKenna, 31, and expert colourist Sussan Gilbert, 28, who will mastermind the whole process.

The salon has a growing female client-base happy to spend, on average, a staggering £500 on extensions per visit, rather more than the £50 my appointments usually cost.

No synthetic glued-on horrors here; the extensions used are made from the highest quality real hair, which is blended to match the customer’s own tones.

The salon’s technique is so popular that it gets through 25kg of hair every six weeks.

Sarah explains that achieving Kim’s look will involve two stages; first lightening my natural auburn to recreate her ones, then adding extensions for the swooshy length.

I have to admit that despite being thrilled about the possibility of achieving Kim’s celebrated coiffure, I am filled with trepidation.

My locks may be lacklustre, but they are untreated — what Sarah calls ‘virgin hair’ — and consequently undamaged. I worry my makeover will do serious harm, though I’m reassured that a one-off will be fine.

Sussan inspects a picture of Kim at Wimbledon this week and observes: ‘Her look is very glamorous but also natural — almost as if she got her colour by sitting in the stands.’

I wonder if I have any hope of achieving this effect with my reddy-brown strands, but Sussan, a colourist with ten years’ experience, has a plan.

She will ‘lift’ my natural colour with a multitude of fine highlights, using a low peroxide tint that will lighten my hair while keeping the texture soft and natural.

Producing three shades of permanent colour — mid blonde ash, dark blonde ash and honey blonde — Sussan proceeds to take tiny sections of hair, painting each with a single colour. The strands are then wrapped in foil and left to develop.

Sussan puts more than 80 foils in my hair — what’s called a three-quarter head of highlights.

An hour-and-a-half later she completes the procedure with ‘balayage’ — colour painted on to the tips to accentuate them, which she assures me will flatter the contours of my face. The colour is then left on for a further 35 minutes.

When my hair has been washed and rough-dried I am pleasantly surprised.

The colour isn’t the dramatic departure I had feared. It is, however, noticeably lighter, almost as if I had just returned from a long summer holiday or, indeed, a few weeks watching tennis under sunny skies.

Sarah now takes over to add the extensions. The hair the salon uses arrives in thick ponytails, in a huge variety of natural shades. 

The ponytails come in lengths of 14 to 22 inches (the most popular is the 18-inch ‘boob’ length) and cost £150 to £250 from her supplier.

To recreate Kim’s mane, I will need a full head of 22-inch extensions. That’s two-and-a-half ponytails’ worth, costing around £700.

Sarah expertly selects hair from four ponytails: light blonde, light ash, dark ash and golden. She brushes the strands together and holds them up to my hair. To my astonishment, the shades are almost identical.

To create extensions, small strands are taken and bonded with keratin resin — a brown glue-like substance — at one end to form ‘tips’ like the ends of a shoelace.

Coveted: Kim Sears' hair. The final step of Annabel's makeover is to have her new head of hair is washed and blow-dried to give it Kim's signature va-va-voom

Sarah works for four hours fitting more than 250 extensions — it’s a long process.

As the locks begin to tumble over my shoulders, I give a toss of my head. Three people stand back to make way for my flying tresses. I begin to get a sense of what power hair can do.

Once it’s complete, I look in the mirror. But my heart sinks; instead of a tennis princess, I look like an ageing schoolgirl badly in need of a haircut.

But it’s now that Danielle, another hairdresser, takes over to trim the shapeless extensions into soft layers. At the same time my own hair is cut so it blends as smoothly as possible.

Finally my new head of hair is washed and blow-dried to give it Kim’s signature va-va-voom.

My verdict: I am stunned. Swishing it from side to side my hair is soft and lustrous and, having avoided colour for years, I am pleasantly surprised by the subtle yet distinctive result.

But what will my family think? My son, Kit, sees me first. ‘You look weird,’ he tells me. But 15-year-old Elsa — my toughest critic — is surprisingly positive: ‘You look really young, mummy.’

Meanwhile, my husband, a man who doesn’t mince words, says he is impressed, although he comments that my voluminous tresses somewhat dwarf my 5ft 4in frame. I look like I might topple over.

The best comes that evening when a friend pops in and says that he mistook me for a friend of Elsa’s. I’d love to believe him.

So could I pass for radiant Kim? Well, no, I am still a middle-aged mother-of-three. But can I carry off her championship-winning hair?

The answer, I think, is a resounding ‘yes’. Now all I need is a VIP pass for Centre Court.

 So why did Andy Murray choose Amelie Mauresmo as his new coach? Maybe she reminds him of his biggest fan...
