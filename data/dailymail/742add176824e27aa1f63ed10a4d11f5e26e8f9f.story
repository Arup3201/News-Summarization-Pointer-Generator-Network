Google has been ordered to pay compensation to a woman in Montreal, Canada, after a judge ruled that the tech giant had invaded her privacy.

Maria Pia Grillo had claimed she suffered shock and embarrassment after she was searching for her home on Google Map’s Street View in 2009 and discovered that the image they’d used featured her sitting outside the property with ‘part of her breast exposed.’

The photo had been taken by one of Google’s camera-equipped cars and even though they blurred Grillo’s face, she argued that the picture provided enough information for her to be easily identified.

The offending photo of Grillo that appeared on Google Street View and the blurred replacement were compiled in this graphic by local French language newspaper Le Journal de Montreal

Grillo started legal proceedings against Google in 2011 to ‘blur’ the rest of her, as well as her license plate and address, reports Le Journal de Montreal.

She also demanded that the company pay her $45,000 for emotional damage, including depression and mockery from her co-workers.

Google eventually agreed to blur out more of the image, but rejected her claims for compensation on the grounds that she was in a public place and that her subsequent emotional troubles weren’t connected .

A Montreal judge rejected Google’s ‘public place’ defense and said people do not forfeit their privacy rights simply by being in a location where others can see them.

However he did not agree that there was a direct connection with Grillo’s mental condition.

Google was ordered to pay her $2,250 plus interest and an additional $159 in court costs.
