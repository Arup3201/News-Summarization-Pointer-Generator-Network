The airplane plunged to earth while flying over territory held by pro-Russian rebels in Ukraine on July 17 after taking off from Amsterdam, killing all 298 passengers and crew on board.

Detective Fred Westerbeke, who is overseeing the criminal investigation in to the incident, revealed it was 'most likely' shot down but warned it may take years to prosecute the culprits as violence rages on war-torn Ukraine.

Ukrainian servicemen inspect the crash site in July. Dutch investigators, who are charged with leading the hunt for those responsible for the crash, say it could take years to identify and prosecute culprits as conflict rages on in eastern Ukraine 

'It's going to be a long investigation. I don't rule out that we can identify a suspect and bring this to a prosecution,' he said after revealing the theory that the flight was shot down was 'the one getting the most attention' from the Dutch National Prosecutors Office. 

It has previously speculated the flight was brought down accidentally by pro-Russian rebels fighting over territory in eastern Ukraine. 

The theory that the Kremlin aided rebel fighters by supplying them with weapons has been vehemently denied by President Vladimir Putin. 

Shortly after the disaster in June, a highly placed rebel revealed in a press interview that the plane had been shot down by a mixed team of rebels and Russian military personnel who believed they were targeting a Ukrainian military plane. 

Intercepted phone calls between fighters supported his claims. 

Dutch police chief Patricia Zorko said detectives were considering more than 300million web pages and thousands of images as part of the investigation into the tragedy. 

The flight took off from Schiphol airport near Amsterdam on July 17 shortly after 12.30pm (pictured). All 298 passengers and crew on board were killed when it plummeted

'More investigation is underway to find out where these things come from,' she said. 

Detective Westerbeke's comments come after a separate report claimed the aircraft was split into multiple pieces before it hit the ground. 

The report by the Dutch Safety Board said it was likely the damage caused 'resulted in a loss of structural integrity of the aircraft, leading to an in-flight break up.'

Its findings were supported by the U.S. State Department, a spokesman for which said it matched 'our original assessment, that it was likely shot down by one of these surface-to-air missiles fired from separatist-controlled territory in eastern Ukraine.'

The full report is expected to be completed by next July.
