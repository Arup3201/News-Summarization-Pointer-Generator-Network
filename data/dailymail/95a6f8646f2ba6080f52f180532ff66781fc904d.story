A Dutch mother has defied safety warnings and travelled to Syria in disguise to rescue her daughter from the Islamic State. 

Wearing a burka, the woman from Maastricht - named only as Monique - crossed from Turkey into the Syrian city of Raqqa to save her daughter Aicha, 19. 

Aicha had appealed to her mother for help last month after converting to Islam and marrying Omar Yilmaz, a notorious Dutch jihadi.

The teenager married the former soldier, after seeing him interviewed on television, the Telegraph reports. 

Monique was told by Dutch police that the rescue mission would be too dangerous and that she could be prosecuted for the 'provision of assistance to jihadists'. 

But she defied their warnings and arranged on Facebook to meet her daughter. 

The Algemeen Dagblad newspaper reports that she told family and friends: 'Sometimes you gotta do what you gotta do. This is what I think is right.'

'She wanted to go home, but could not leave Raqqa without help,' she added.

After the daring rescue mission, mother and daughter then fled Syria and crossed back to Turkey, where Aicha was arrested for not having a passport.

Ministry officials are now in the process of bringing the pair to the Netherlands. 

Françoise Landerloo, the family's lawyer told the Algemeen Dagblad newspaper: 'It is quite remarkable that the mother managed to find and get her daughter.'
