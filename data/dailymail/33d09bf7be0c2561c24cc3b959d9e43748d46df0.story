At $1100, it had better keep your drinks really cold, and your music sounding great.

An Austin firm has revealed a luxury ice cooler boasting high end hifi capabilities.

It claims the gadget can provide music (and beer) to any size party. 

The $1100 Kube is described as 'a complete and quantum leap entertainment solution' - and is an ice chest with a bluetooth speaker built in.

Launched today at CES in Las Vegas, the Kube is described as 'a complete and quantum leap entertainment solution that combines hyper-elegant design, simplified, meticulously engineered functionality, and unmatched sound quality with insulated beverage and food storage.'

'Seeing, using, and most of all, hearing Kube, is believing in this new, game changing portable audio and entertainment experience,' said Russell Williamson, founder of Thomas & Darden, the firm behind the cooler.

'I personally tested the prototype in hundreds of gatherings – small, large, outdoor, indoor, loud, quiet, wet, dry, public, and intimate – you name it. Kube's amazing technology and sturdy, yet beautiful design will upgrade and enliven any setting.'

The cooler links to phones via bluetooth to play music, and has marine quality speakers, meaning it can be used in a downpour.

The firm says it can last for 20 hours on a single charge, and output 100 decibels - enough for all but the biggest parties.

Made of aluminum and durable coated polymer,it has five backlit buttons (power, Bluetooth pair, volume up, down, play/pause), and covered USB charging and power inputs on the back. 

LED lights automatically fade up to illuminate the 33-quart interior cooler storage compartment, and the entire thing weighs 20 pounds. 

'Whether positioned in the middle of the 'scene' or obscurely tucked away, Kube's quality sound drives an exciting social experience on terms set entirely by the user,' the firm says.
