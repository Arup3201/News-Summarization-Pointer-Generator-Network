David Cameron vowed to crush Ed Miliband’s ‘1970s-style socialism’ yesterday as he put tax cuts, enterprise and opportunity at the heart of an election campaign to reprise the Tories’ defeat of Neil Kinnock.

The Prime Minister condemned Labour’s ‘damaging, nonsensical, twisted economic policy’ and scoffed at what he called ‘Red Ed and his Blue Peter economy’ – saying it would heap ruin on Britain.

In an annual conference speech shorn of policy gimmicks and rhetorical flourishes, he repeatedly asked voters to allow the Conservatives to ‘finish the job’ of turning Britain around.

Fighting talk: Prime Minister David Cameron vowed to crush Ed Miliband's '1970s-style socialism' yesterday at the annual Tory conference

Land of opportunity: Cameron vowed to put tax cuts and enterprise at the heart of the Conservative election campaign

In other developments on the final day of the Tory conference in Manchester:

In his speech, the Prime Minister claimed the ‘land of hope is Tory’ while ‘the land of despair was Labour’.

But in an echo of the 1992 election campaign, the last time the Tories won power outright, Mr Cameron signalled a relentless focus on Labour’s lack of credibility on the economy – attacking both Mr Miliband and Ed Balls.

He spoke of wanting to create a ‘land of opportunity for all’ – an echo of slogans used by Margaret Thatcher in 1987 and John Major in 1992.

The Conservatives have already announced that fuel duty is likely to be frozen until the election and pledged to introduce a £1,000 transferable tax allowance for married couples.

Mr Cameron pointed out that the Government had also cut taxes for 25million basic-rate taxpayers by raising personal tax allowances.

And in an indication that the Tory’s next manifesto will pledge to raise the tax allowance still higher, he declared: ‘We’re Tories, we believe in low taxes. And believe me – we will keep on cutting the taxes of hard-working people.’

'We're Tories, we believe in low taxes. And believe me – we will keep on cutting the taxes of hard-working people.'

Tory strategists believe Mr Miliband made a major blunder in his speech last week by shifting decisively to the Left, proposing 1970s-style price fixing in the energy market, state seizures of undeveloped land and penalties for businesses who fail to take on trainees.

In his 50-minute address, Mr Cameron said Labour had comprehensively lost the economic argument and it was clear to all that the economy was ‘turning the corner’.

He said: ‘There was a time when I’d look across to Ed Balls and he was shouting his head off, screaming that the economy was flatlining with such glee.

'But recently, it’s gone a bit quiet. Could it be because there was no double dip and the economy’s growing?’

Mr Cameron said the last government had left behind a ‘casino economy meets the welfare society meets the broken education system’.

Business, he pointed out, had already created 1.4million new jobs since the last election and must be helped, not deterred.

‘Profit, wealth creation, tax cuts, enterprise: these are not dirty, elitist words – they’re not the problem, they are the solution, because it’s not government that creates jobs, it’s businesses.

‘You don’t do this job to be popular. You do it because you love your country. I do the best I can.'

David Cameron

'I know that bashing business might play to a Labour audience. But it’s crazy for our country.’

Mr Cameron said he knew voters were asking whether the ‘struggle’ of the past few years of austerity had all been worth it.

He said: ‘Here’s the honest answer: the struggle will only be worth it if we as a country finish the job we’ve started.’

To abandon deficit reduction now would throw away ‘all the progress we’ve made’, the Prime Minister insisted. ‘How did they [Labour] get us into this mess?

'Too much spending, too much borrowing, too much debt. And what did they propose last week? ‘More spending, more borrowing, more debt.

History repeating? The Tories last won an election outright with a similar sentiment - one that saw John Major's Conservatives beat off a challenge from Neil Kinnock's Labour Party

'They have learned nothing – literally nothing – from the crisis they created.’

He dismissed Mr Miliband’s promises to cut the cost of living as ‘all sticking plasters and quick fixes’.

Acknowledging spending cuts had been unpopular, Mr Cameron added: ‘You don’t do this job to be popular. You do it because you love your country. I do the best I can.

'Labour have learned nothing – literally nothing – from the crisis they created.'

David Cameron

'And for me it comes back to some simple things – country first, do what’s decent, think long-term.’

It was not enough simply to clean up Labour’s economic ‘mess’ and pay off the deficit, he said, the Conservatives wanted to ‘build something better in its place’.

The Conservative leader also sought to march onto centre-ground territory, where his party has traditionally found it difficult to make inroads against Labour – promising to drive industrial regeneration in the North of England and positioning the Tories as the true defenders of the NHS.

After the scandal of the Mid-Staffordshire hospital trust, where hundreds of patients died, the Conservatives would take no lectures from Labour on the NHS, he said.

He even praised the ‘noble calling’ of social work – promising to get more top-flight graduates into the profession.

And the Prime Minister sought to assure Tory troops that he is fighting for a majority Tory government, not another power-sharing administration with the Lib Dems.

John Cridland, head of the 
Confederation of British Industry, said Mr Cameron had ‘sent out a 
strong message about how vital British business is to the future 
prosperity of people across the UK’.

But Labour vice-chairman Michael Dugher said: ‘There’s a cost-of-living crisis and he’s got nothing to say about it.

‘Rather
 than standing up for hard-working people he has always puts a 
privileged few first, prioritising a tax cut for those earning over 
£150,000 while everyone else pays more.’

Mr Cameron was joined by wife Samantha on stage as his audience gave him a standing ovation.

The
 pair left the auditorium to the sound of Fleetwood Mac’s Don’t Stop 
Thinking About Tomorrow, used by Bill Clinton during his successful 
campaign in 1992.

Margaret Thatcher was the greatest peacetime Prime Minister Britain ever had, David Cameron said yesterday.

Conservatives this year ‘said goodbye to one of our team,’ he told a packed hall at the party conference in Manchester.

He hailed the achievements of the late Baroness Thatcher, who died in April this year.

Mr Cameron said: ‘Margaret Thatcher made our country stand tall again, at home and abroad.’

He went on to list some of her many achievements: ‘Rescuing our economy, giving power to our people, spreading home ownership, creating work, winning the Cold War, saving the Falklands.’

He also revealed how he had sat next to her at dinner once and had been very nervous to speak to her.

Mr Cameron asked her about her record and told how she had been ‘totally charming’ and had ‘put me at ease’.

But when he asked the Iron Lady what she would do differently if she had her time in government again, she replied: ‘You know, I think I did pretty well the first time around.’

Mr Cameron added: ‘We can all agree with that and we can all agree with this – she was the greatest peacetime Prime Minister our country has ever had.’
