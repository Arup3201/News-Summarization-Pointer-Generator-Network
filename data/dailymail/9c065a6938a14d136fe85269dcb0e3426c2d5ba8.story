Microsoft will release the Pro version of its Surface tablet on February 9 with a price tag of £630 - making it the most expensive tablet computer in the world.

The North America launch marks a new phase in Microsoft's global battle against arch-rival Apple, which sells its top of the range iPads £108 cheaper.

The new Surface Windows 8 Pro is powered by an Intel chip and can use the full version of Windows 8 - meaning programs such as Photoshop can be used.

The updated tablet is set to hit U.S. 
and Canadian shops on February 9, with a starting price of US$899 (£568) for a 64GB version, and $999 (£630) for the 128GB 
version. This compares to $829 for Apple's top 64GB iPad - it does not make an equivalent with 128GB.

Beefed up: Microsoft's new Surface Pro, which comes with a laptop-style Intel processor, runs the full version of Windows 8 and can use fully featured Windows software like Photoshop and Microsoft Office

However, it still lacks mobile network connectivity, meaning that users will have to be within range of a WiFi network to access the internet on the device.

The Surface Pro will come packaged with the Surface Pen, which allows users to write or draw on the device, but will not include the Soft Cover Keyboard, which will set users back a further $129 (£82).

Prices for Britain, which would include VAT, have not been released.

Add the extra keyboard and, since it is able to run Windows software like Photoshop, Microsoft Office and even resource-hungry video games, the Intel Core i5-powered tablet could easily be a fully featured laptop replacement.

Its ARM chip-powered little brother runs Windows RT, a slimmed down version of the operating system, and only works with apps bought on the Windows store and a modified version of Office that Microsoft includes with the device.

The pro version of Surface does not come with Office installed.

'Surface Windows 8 Pro provides the power and performance of a laptop in a tablet package,' Microsoft said in a release.

'Perfect as your one device — at home, in the office, or on the road — it can run Windows 8 applications, as well as current Windows 7 desktop applications.'

Laptop replacement: Microsoft say the Surface Pro offers the power and performance of a laptop in a tablet-shaped package - although the keyboard is not included as standard

Panos Panay, general manager of Microsoft's Surface division, added in a blog post: 'Whether you’re a road warrior, a student or someone who just wants a flexible and powerful Intel PC, the Surface Windows 8 Pro will deliver.

'It’s the perfect complement to the Surface Windows RT and delivers hours and hours of entertainment with plenty of power and productivity to get your work done as well.'

At its launch, two versions of the Surface Pro will be available. The $899 version will come with 64GB of solid-state storage, while a 128GB version will set buyers back a rather steep $999.

Intuitive interface: The Surface Pro comes packaged with the Surface Pen, which allows users to write or draw on the device. Combined with Windows software like Photoshop it has exciting potential

As well as the x86-type Intel processor, the Surface Pro comes equipped with 4GB of RAM and a sparkling 1920x1080 high-definition display, compared to the Surface RT's 1366x768 screen resolution.

The screen also supports 10-point multi-touch, double what its little brother can offer.

However, because of the power demands of i5 chip it also has a shorter battery life, managing closer to five hours against the ten hours more typical for rival tablets.

It's also a little bit heavier than the earlier version, at 2lbs rather than 1.5lbs.

In the same release yesterday, 
Microsoft announced it will make available three new limited edition 
Touch Covers, in red, magenta and cyan, and a Surface Edition of its 
stylish Wedge Touch Mouse.

The company also announced that it will double the reach of the Surface RT by selling it in 13 additional markets worldwide.

The
tablet is currently available in Australia, Canada, China, France, 
Germany, Hong Kong, the UK and the U.S., but will soon also be sold in 
Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, the 
Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, and Switzerland.

Stylish: Also announced was the Surface Edition of Microsoft's funky-looking Wedge Touch Mouse

Microsoft
hasn't released sales figures for the earlier version of Surface, but 
Mr Panay said in a release: 'The response to Surface has been exciting 
to see.

'We’re thrilled to 
continue growing the Surface family with the availability of Surface 
Windows 8 Pro and by increasing the number of places customers can 
experience Surface first hand.'

Availability
and pricing of the Surface Windows 8 Pro outside North America have yet
to be announced but Microsoft says it will go on sale in other markets 
'in the coming weeks', The Register reports.
