With its formidable 5ft fences, the Hickstead Derby is a challenge for any horse.

So for 14-year-old Addy, who had his right eye removed after an infection, the event looked like an insurmountable task.

But the showjumper didn’t bat an eyelid – and became the first one-eyed horse in the derby’s 54-year history to win the coveted trophy.

The one-eyed winner of the Hickstead Derby, Adventure de Kannan (known as Addy ) with rider , Trevor Breen's daughter, Mia ( 20 months)

Addy – full name Adventure de Kannan – had his eye removed last year, following six years of painful ulcers.

Since then, he hasn’t looked back. ‘If anything, it’s made him better,’ said his rider Trevor Breen.

‘He’s got a great attitude and a big heart... which is why I think he has been able to overcome adversity so well. Whatever you ask him to do, he gives everything.’

Taking everything in his stride, Addy is rarely spooked by people approaching on his blind side, and has honed his hearing to compensate.

Cheered by a 15,000-strong crowd, the fiercely determined bay gelding overcame what many believed would be an insurmountable handicap to be garlanded as the first one-eyed champion in the event’s 54-year history.

Yesterday, strutting around a paddock and chomping carrots at home on a Buckinghamshire farm, you could hardly blame him for resting on his laurels a little. (Especially as he shares it with a one-eyed dog, and, until recently, the family’s one-eyed goldfish, RIP).

But as triumphant rider Mr Breen and his 26-year-old wife Caroline explained, the equestrian one-eyed wonder can still see a bright future ahead of him in what has turned out to be a remarkable showjumping career.

The story of Addy began when Trevor, a championship rider and leading equestrian figure, borrowed the horse from owner Karen Swann, then a neighbour in his native Ireland.

‘I liked him straight away,’ he told me yesterday. ‘So basically I never gave him back. We kind of struck up a relationship.

He’s got a great attitude and a big heart… which is why I think he has been able to overcome adversity so well. Whatever you ask him to do, he gives everything.’

Addy had his eye removed last year, following six years of painful ulcers. Cheered by a 15,000-strong crowd, the fiercely determined bay gelding overcame what many believed would be an insurmountable handicap to be garlanded as the first one-eyed champion in the event's 54-year history

Addy’s eye condition was first noticed when he was eight. Despite being able to compete in major events, he needed constant monitoring by vets and years of treatment.

Instead of looking forward to a pat and a Polo when someone came into the stable, he would usually have to undergo some sort of treatment or medication.

Being such an obliging horse, however, Addy would tip is head to one side to make it easier to apply eye drops. Then, to the distress of everyone around him, things changed.

‘Addy effectively told me it was over,’ said Trevor, 35. ‘Instead of tilting his head, it took two grooms to hold him just to get the drops in. He was obviously in pain and we didn’t know how much, or for how long he’d been putting up with it.

Last year the infected right eye was removed by a specialist surgeon, leaving only the socket.

No-one knew then what effect it would have on Addy or on his showjumping career.

Because of the position of eyes on a horse’s head, they do not have peripheral vision anyway. So to approach and jump fences with only one eye would be an enormous feat. Except, that is, if you’re a trooper like Addy, a giant at 17.1 hands tall and a horse that doesn’t like to say no.

'He changed instantly,’ said Trevor. ‘It was like we’d wound the clock back three years. His character came back… he got a little bit cheeky… we had almost forgotten how he was before. It was the best decision we ever made.’

And his performance? ‘If anything, it’s made him better,’ said Trevor. ‘I think I started off by riding him a little bit differently and over-compensating for him. In the end I just rode normally and let him get on with it. It seems to have worked.’

Perhaps surprisingly, he is rarely spooked by people approaching on his blind side.

Addy resides at the family farm and equestrian business in Gerrards Cross along with a stable of other sporting horses.

Since the operation he has become a firm friend of Caroline and Trevor’s 20-month-old daughter Mia, keeping perfectly still to enable her to sit on his back.

Soon, however, there will be work to do - his competition calendar is full for the next several months. And of course, he has a keen eye on some more trophies.
