The sister of murdered Lone Wolf bikie Neal Todorovski has confronted her brother’s killer in a dramatic courtroom scene.

At a sentencing hearing for convicted killer Tarek Abdallah in the NSW Supreme court on Thursday, the slain bikie’s sister Elizabeth Dimoski said his death in Sans Souci rips her heart to pieces every day.

She stared at Abdallah as she told him his ‘heartless and dangerous actions’ destroyed the lives of those who loved her brother.

‘(They) left me feeling like I too was there lying on that cold, hard ground alongside my brother, with both our brains and our blood pouring out of our heads and our bodies,’ she told the NSW Supreme Court.

In March, Tarek Abdallah, 27, was found guilty of shooting Todorovski dead in broad daylight in January 2012.

He had pleaded not guilty to both the murder of Neal Todorovski and to the charge of shooting with intent to murder the bikie’s associate John Leger, arguing that he had acted in self-defence.

He was convicted of the Lone Wolf’s murder but found not guilty of the second charge.

‘The only difference is my brother's pain died with him that day. But me? I still feel that pain like brain-shattering bullets going through my head and my heart, ripping it to pieces every day,' Ms Dimoski said.

‘All because you were angry.’

She reportedly clenched and unclenched her fists as she delivered the harrowing statement, stopping on multiple occasions to compose herself.

She could be heard crying outside as Abdallah's barrister David Dalton SC argued his client had acted in self-defence.

Mr Dalton told the court Abdallah unleashed a ‘volley of shots’ in fear for his life.

The court had previously heard Mr Todorovski and Mr Leger went to Sans Souci with knuckle-dusters and a gun and had been out to get Abdallah after the 27-year-old's attempts to patch up a misunderstanding failed.

The murder victim and the gunman were earlier involved in an intense street fight in which Abdallah smashed Todorovski's head on the pavement, causing him a broken eye socket.

Police later intercepted a call between Todorovski and his friend in which he described the fight in graphic detail.

'(Abdallah) bashed my head against the concrete,' he told friend Michael Why.

'It was game over for me'.

In the murder trial, Crown prosecutor Paul Leask said Mr Todorovski was first shot twice in the back by Abdallah and fell to the ground.

Abdallah then put a bullet through his skull, he said.

He said the victim was still alive when ambulances arrived.

Mr Leask ask Justice Stephen Campbell to take into account the ‘callousness’ of Abdallah's crime when considering his sentence, due to be handed down next month.
