One of Britain’s finest heptathletes is chasing Chorizo — her spirited sausage dog — along Crosby Beach, occasionally pulling him away from an unlikely confrontation with a passing bulldog and feeding him treats he has sniffed out in her handbag.

‘I’m going to get another caramel-coloured one,’ says Katarina Johnson-Thompson. ‘I think I’ll call it Twix.’ She has a keen sense of humour but her breezy manner has been tested to its limits over recent months.

A freak foot injury put a premature end to her 2014 season but on a crisp sunny morning on the coast six miles north of Liverpool, Johnson-Thompson is in an optimistic mood.

But on a crisp sunny morning on the coast six miles north of Liverpool, Johnson-Thompson is in an optimistic mood. It is her first day back at training after three months off.

‘I’ve been counting down to this day,’ she says. ‘I just have to trust I can get back to where I was and be even better on a bigger stage. I am targeting medals at the World Championships next year.’

Despite the injury, which robbed her of the chance to ‘show the world’ what she can do at the Commonwealth Games and European Championships, it was still a breakthrough year. Johnson-Thompson won her first major senior medal in the long jump and set a world leading heptathlon score to win in Gotzis, the biggest event for multi-eventers outside the major championships. ‘If I’d done all that any other year I’d have been delighted,’ she says.

There are plenty of people in high places backing her to do big things. Former Olympic champion Jackie Joyner-Kersee believes she can not only win heptathlon Olympic gold in 2016 but also break her own world record. American legend Joyner-Kersee predicted the 21-year-old would surpass her score of 7,291, which has stood since 1988. Sweden’s Karolina Cluft, widely considered one of the best athletes of a generation, and Britain’s golden girl Jessica Ennis-Hill could not come close.

‘My mum sent me the link to the online video,’ recalls Johnson-Thompson, ‘I was watching it thinking, “What the hell is she saying I’m going to get a world record for?” It’s crazy to even hear her say my name and such an honour for her to think I’m capable of getting that. I don’t think anyone’s capable of getting that, it’s such an incredible score.’

It was a reminder of her towering potential and a confidence boost after a summer of ‘complete devastation’, trying to avoid watching on TV and following on social media as her team-mates competed at the Commonwealth Games and European Championships. ‘I was ready to go and post a big score,’ she says. ‘The biggest hit is I couldn’t show the world what I can do. My whole family was coming to watch me for the first time. They’d made banners, got accommodation and tickets.

‘On the day I got the scan on my foot — our medical bills are paid for by the National Lottery — I met my coach in the pub and we decided that I couldn’t do the full heptathlon. As I was leaving, this guy came up and said, “I thought I recognised you, you’re going to do Liverpool so proud at the Commonwealth Games, go win gold girl!”

‘I turned to my coach and said, “Maybe I will still do it”. But he said, “You can’t chance it over one tipsy fella in the pub”. It just made me think about all the people I was letting down.’ She wells up at the memory.

As her team-mates experienced Britain’s most successful European Championships in Zurich, Johnson-Thompson could not watch on TV. The only positive has been seeing more of her boyfriend Nick Bright, a presenter on BBC Radio 1Xtra. She has been to see him DJ in Cyprus and the pair have just returned from a two-week holiday in Thailand.

‘I used to be an Arctic Monkeys head but he’s got me into hip-hop and urban music. We’ve been doing little day trips to take my mind off things.’

Johnson-Thompson has also been kept busy by moving out of the house she shared with her mother and grandmother and into her own home, which she shares with Chorizo. ‘My nan used to do the cooking and my mum used to just look after me to make life easier for athletics,’ she says. ‘I didn’t realise how many dishes have to be cleaned. It's weird being on my own now but I’ve got my dog and Snapchat.’

Johnson-Thompson’s phone lights up every few seconds with new messages from friends. She also shows me an app she uses to keep track of her overall heptathlon score. ‘It acts like a calculator. You put in your personal best for the seven events and it converts the scores. I used to have to use a book to do it, turn all the pages, then write it down and add it up.’

It will come in useful as Johnson-Thompson focuses on her biggest year yet, with next August’s World Championships in Beijing the primary target. By then Ennis-Hill is expected to be back in action after the birth of her first child, Reggie. Johnson-Thompson has often been branded ‘the next Ennis-Hill’ after breaking her British junior heptathlon record, but she does not feel burdened by the comparisons.

‘I don’t think about it,’ she says, ‘Every athlete wants to win gold so it’s not like someone said I’m like Jess so I have to win gold because she did. I want to win a gold medal anyway. It’s definitely good Jess will be back. It’s scary as well because she is an Olympic champion and she can bounce back, as she showed after missing the Beijing Olympics in 2008.’

Two British athletes on the comeback trail and set for an almighty match-up on the world stage. Whatever the outcome, the future looks promising for the heptathlon in Britain.
