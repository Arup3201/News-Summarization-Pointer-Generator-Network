A Missouri man released this week after almost a decade in jail for a murder he did not commit has vowed to use his freedom to campaign for justice for the victim’s family – even though they remain convinced of his guilt, MailOnline can reveal.

Twenty-nine year old Ryan Ferguson was just 19 when he was convicted and sentenced to 40 years in prison for the brutal murder of Kent Heitholt, local newspaper sports editor in Columbia, Missouri.

There was no physical evidence connecting Ferguson to the crime and the guilty verdict was based solely on two witnesses who later retracted their testimony.

Freed man walking: After a decade in jail for a murder he didn't commit, Ryan Ferguson admits it will take time to adjust to his very changed hometown of Columbia, in an interview with Dateline's Keith Morrison

His family fought for years for Ferguson’s release. Now, he has revealed his intention to follow the campaigning example set by his father, Bill, in an exclusive interview with Keith Morrison, 66, for NBC’s Dateline.

Mr Morrison told MailOnline: ‘Ryan is a remarkable young man. He has withstood the pressures of being in that environment for so many years and now he that he’s free he wants to get the Heitholt family a sense of justice.

'They still believe he’s guilty. He feels they’ve been lied to for years and he intends to campaign to have the investigation re-opened.'

Mr Heitholt’s widow, Deborah Evangelista, issued a brief statement on learning of Ferguson’s release, and described the news as ‘painful.’ 

The reunion he feared would never happen: Ryan is met by his grandfather at the door of his Florida home. As he held his grandson close the older man said simply, 'I love you.'

She said: ‘It is painful. You just 
want to let go and lead your life. I have to keep reminding myself that 
whatever happens, God is in control and justice will ultimately be 
served by him.’

Since his 
sensational release on Tuesday, Ferguson has, according to Mr Morrison, 
being trying to adjust to the reality of life on the outside.

Mr Morrison has followed Ferguson’s case and his family’s fight, for several years and sat down with Ryan on the day he received word that this time, after a string of devastating disappointments, his freedom was ensured.

Recalling Ferguson's demeanor during the interview, which airs tonight at 8pm (7pm Central Time), Mr Morrison said: ‘I was sitting down with Ryan at 11am that morning while he was still waiting for word. You could tell he wasn’t allowing himself to get excited but there was lightness about him that I hadn’t seen before.

‘He just looked like a different person.

‘Seven hours later he was standing in front of an overflowing crowd of cheering excited people, dressed in clothes he hadn’t worn for a decade, surrounded by people he hadn’t seen for a decade.’

At a press conference at the Tiger Hotel in Columbia Ferguson spoke with remarkable composure as he acknowledged the efforts of his family and attorney, Kathleen Zellner.

They never lost hope: Ryan with his mother Leslie, left, father Bill, right and sister Kelly. His mother always believed her son would be returned to her and his father never stopped campaigning to make it happen

He said: ‘To get arrested and charged for a crime you didn’t commit is incredibly easy, and you lose your life very fast. But to get out of prison, it takes an army.’

High on Ferguson's 'to-do list' on his release was visiting his grandparents in Florida, where he had spent many happy summers.

He had not seen them since Christmas 2003 and had feared he would never see them again. Mr Morrison and his crew flew Ferguson and his mother to Florida and an emotional reunion.

Ferguson was arrested in 2004 and convicted the following year after his friend Chuck Erikson came forward and confessed to the crime that took place in 2001.

Kent Heitholt was viciously beaten and strangled in the car park behind his newspaper offices. Hair, fingerprints and bloody footprints had been found at the scene but there was not a shred of forensic evidence that pointed to either Erikson or Ferguson.

Today, Mr Morrison said, Ferguson is not angry with the former friend who drew him into a nightmare.

He said: ‘I think there were many years during which Ryan was angry at Chuck but then he realized Chuck was a confused drug addict and alcoholic, with a history of black outs.

‘Chuck had problems and was used and manipulated.’

When asked of his feelings towards Erikson, Ferguson said: ‘I know he’s not a killer. He doesn’t belong in prison.’

He also said that he respected Erikson and janitor Jerry Trump who identified Ferguson as having been at the scene of the crime for, ‘having the courage to admit they lied.’

Speaking at the moment of his son’s release Bill Ferguson, who campaigned tirelessly on his behalf, said: ‘It’s the best feeling ever we just feel like we’ve rescued him from the pits of despair.’

According to Mr Morrison it was a mantra of his father’s that helped Ferguson through some of his darkest days in prison.

He said: ‘His father told him, “Don’t feel sorry for yourself – be better, stronger and smarter and concentrate on what you can do to better yourself.”’

Ferguson used his time in prison to read and to try to educate other prisoners about nutrition and exercise while inside.

Mr Morrison said: ‘Over the years of interviewing Ryan it’s really struck me what an articulate, thoughtful young man he is.

‘Without that the chances of me getting released were slim to none. I recognise I was unlucky in the first place but I was enormously lucky after the fact.”’

The reality, according to Mr Morrison who has investigated countless miscarriages of justice in his career, is, ‘Around the country, scattered in prisons all over America are people who do not have the chances Ryan had, people who will not get out.’

Now Ferguson, wants to spend some time with the girlfriend he met while in prison, his friends and his family.

Having learned how to live in jail he has admitted to being daunted by the prospect of learning to survive on the outside.

Mr Morrison said: ‘Ryan said that the first morning he woke up as a free man he felt he’d slept in a bed that was too soft, on a pillow that wasn’t right. 

‘He went for a walk and felt like a tourist in his hometown because it has changed so much over the years.

‘He said he felt stressed for the first time in a long time and he recognises that his job now is to work out how to live. He’s 29 and he has to work out what to do with his life now he’s been given it back.’
