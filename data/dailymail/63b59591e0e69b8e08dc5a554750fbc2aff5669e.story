Many a British holidaymaker has rubbed the sleep from their eyes to gaze in bewilderment at the rows of sunloungers requisitioned long before breakfast.

Now research may have solved the mystery of how German tourists always get their towels there first.

According to a major study of sleeping habits, they spend less time asleep – and get out of bed more quickly when the alarm goes.

While Britons sleep for an average of 
seven hours and 21 minutes each night, our counterparts in Germany get 
by with eight minutes fewer. And while we take advantage of the snooze 
button to get an average of 20 more minutes in bed, they are up and 
about after just 15.

Professor Russell Foster, a 
neuroscientist at Oxford University, looked at the sleeping habits of 
more than 10,000 participants from both countries.

He said his findings may be down to the fact that Germans begin to work earlier.

They usually get to the office at 8.20am, while we are typically at our desks by 8.50am.

Towels down: Germans have a natural advantage getting to the sunloungers first because they sleep less, a study has found

But while our later starts might  cost us a comfortable poolside lounger, there is good news too.

Our sleeping habits are more in tune 
with our natural body clock, according to Professor Till Roenneberg, 
head of the Munich Centre for Chronobiology, who contributed to the 
study.

He said that we have lower levels of 
‘social jetlag’ – the difference between our actual sleeping habits and 
our natural sleep cycle –  because our habits ‘better suit our sleep 
needs’.

Professor Foster said: ‘The fact Britons are sleeping more and 
have less social jetlag would promote more creativity. In terms of 
quality wake time at work, this is good news.’

And without casting aspersions on the 
ability of the Germans to enjoy a joke, sleeping longer may also account
for the famous British sense of humour.

Professor Foster said: ‘Sleeping 
longer is known to help us with memory but also language skills and 
creativity. That includes our sense of humour – our ability to look at 
the world and laugh is very much influenced by sleep.’
