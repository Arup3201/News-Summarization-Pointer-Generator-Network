Parents are being fined £60 if their children are a few minutes late for school in a tough new crackdown on discipline.

Two headteachers in the same local authority are believed to be the first to take the action in an attempt to slash truancy rates.

The parents of a persistent offender face a £60 fixed penalty – which can be doubled if they fail to pay within 21 days.

Fine mess: The headteacher at Emerson Valley School in Milton Keynes, Buckinghamshire, has warned parents they will face fines of £60 if their children are late

Headteachers have been able to impose
 financial penalties on the parents of regular truants since 2003, but 
Milton Keynes Council has said schools can classify children as skipping
 school even if they arrive late.

Two schools have adopted the policy, including Emerson Valley School, which was rated inadequate by Ofsted inspectors last year.

It
 has issued parents with a warning that they will be fined if a child 
misses registration ten times in a 12-week term. The school said: ‘The 
link between good attendance and pupils achieving well at school is 
clear.

‘During the recent 
Ofsted monitoring inspection it was noted that “strategies to improve 
attendance and punctuality have resulted in a significant increase in 
the proportion of pupils who come to school on time”.

‘At
 the end of the autumn term 2013, 353 pupils at Emerson Valley School 
received certificates for 100 per cent punctuality. This is a big 
improvement on previous years and has been achieved through working with
 our families.’

But the 
policy has infuriated some parents. Georgina Hodgkinson, 40, said: 
‘There needs to be a deterrent but I think it puts lots of pressure on 
parents and does break the commitment between the school and families.

‘If
 you have got, like we have, children in different schools, you are 
trying to navigate logistics from one to the other and there  are always
 going to be some problems.’

But
 another parent, who asked not to be named, said: ‘Kids arriving late 
cause disruption and this has made parents sit up and take notice.’

Education experts welcomed the policy, but said it had to be used in the right circumstances.

Chris
 McGovern, of the Campaign for Real Education, said: ‘If the lateness is
 wilful and persistent and the school decides there is no other way 
forward, then it is justified.

‘But they have to be careful because it can lead to the breakdown of the relationship between the school and parents.

‘There
 is also the question of whether social services should be involved to 
see what is going on at home. Schools shouldn’t act in isolation on 
this.’

Other local authorities are understood to be considering adopting the system to curb the tide of lateness and truancy.

Schools
 were originally able to impose a £50 penalty but this was increased to 
£60 in September 2012 as part of Education Secretary Michael Gove’s 
attempt to restore discipline to schools.

The
 increase came as record numbers of parents were given criminal records 
for allowing children to skip lessons. Some 10,185 parents were found 
guilty and sentenced in 2012 – a 3.5 per cent rise on the 9,836 the 
previous year. In 2001, just 1,845 people were convicted.

A
 spokesman for Milton Keynes Council said: ‘Our figures show that in the
 last academic year, two fixed penalty fines were issued in relation to 
persistent late attendance by pupils. In a majority of cases, a warning 
letter has proved to be enough to stop the issue.'
