A North Carolina man has accidentally shot dead his 10-year-old son while he was cleaning his gun in the family's living room.

Robeson County deputies say 34-year-old Christopher Stanlane was on the couch in his Fairmont home wiping down the weapon when it fired at around 4 p.m. on Sunday.

His son, Christopher Stanlane, Jr., was watching television in front of him when the gun went off, Captain Anthony Thompson said, and a bullet hit the boy in the back of the head.

'He was careful with it,' Robert Simmons, the boy's uncle, told Carolinalive.com. 'I don't think he meant to hold it in that direction. There must have been a bullet lodged in the chamber and it fired and hit him.'

The father dropped his gun and rushed his eight-year-old daughter to another room.

His wife, who had been making dinner when the tragedy happened, called 911. Paramedics arrived at the home and pronounced the child dead on scene.

No charges have been filed in the case.

Thompson says the Robeson County District Attorney will ultimately decide what if any charges will be filed against the father.

Simmons said the parents are in shock, trying to come to terms with what happened.

'She's hanging in there, she's not as best as she could be right now because she lost her son,' he said. 'And the dad, he's in shock, don't really know what's happened right now.'

Simmons said little Christopher would be sorely missed by the family.

'He was a good little boy. He was my little buddy. More than words could ever say to describe how we will miss him, it's just an unbelievable tragedy.'Â
