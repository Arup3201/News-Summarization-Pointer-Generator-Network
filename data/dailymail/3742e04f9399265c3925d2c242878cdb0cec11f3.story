A multi-millionaire who initially offered his ex-wife just £83 to settle their divorce has agreed to pay her a substantial sum.

Christopher Nightingale, 55, told the Old Bailey he was heavily in debt and claimed his ex-wife Sally, 54, does not appreciate money 'because she never had to work'.

But Mrs Nightingale said she was 'cash poor' and needed money from their legal dispute to 'pay the costs of the castle.'

Dispute: Christopher Nightingale, 55, told the Old Bailey he was heavily in debt and claimed his ex-wife Sally does not appreciate money 'because she has never had to work'

Mrs Nightingale, who lives in the Grade I listed Appleby Castle, in Cumbria, has been battling for a fair portion of her husband's shares in computer firm Citadel101.

Mr Nightingale had agreed to give his ex-wife a quarter of his holding in the profitable business, based in Dublin, but claimed last July the shares had declined in value by nearly 20,000 times.

The case has been hit with multiple delays after Mr Nightingale, a qualified lawyer, claimed he did not even have the money to pay his lawyers.

Philip Cayford QC, for Mr Nightingale, said his client had managed to 'borrow' some funds to pay for his services.

The couple, both immaculately dressed, have three children together, but failed to even make eye-contact at the hearing.

Rejecting an application to adjourn from Mr Cayford, he demanded that the case not be allowed to waste further court time.

Mr Justice Holman previously called the sale of the business 'a matter of astonishment', while Mrs Nightingale told the Sunday Times in January: 'I'm not greedy. I'm asset rich but cash poor and need that money to pay the costs of the castle.

'He's trying to starve me out but I intend to fight for the money he promised,' she added.

Later, the parties reached a private agreement.

Mr Justice Mostyn said: 'I am pleased that you have settled the case, Mr and Mrs Nightingale, and I hope you are able to move forward with your lives now.'

Both Mr and Mrs Nightingale declined to comment after the hearing.
