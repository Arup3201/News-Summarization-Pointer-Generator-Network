Surrounded by her children, Katrina Young is a picture of contented motherhood.

But there was a time when this mother of ten feared she would never know the joy of having a child.

She and husband Robert tried for two long and frustrating years to start a family with no success.

Meet the Youngs: Front row from left, Alexi, 8, Robert holds Athena, 2, Electra, 9, Katarina holds baby Nakita, Benicio, 7. Back row from left, Gianni, 14, Yannis, 11, Alanis, 12, Kalika, 5, and Nico, 17.

Then came a diagnosis of polycystic ovary syndrome, which can cause infertility, and a warning from doctors that Mrs Young might never conceive. But that was 17 years ago.

And she has since proved the doctors wrong – ten times over.

Nakita, the latest addition to the Young family, was born in September. She joins Nico, 17, Gianni, 14, Alanis, 12, Yannis, 11, Electra, nine, Alexi, eight, Benicio, seven, Kalika, five, and Athena, two.

Mrs Young, 36, met her husband Robert, 54, a builder, when she was just 16.

She said: ‘I was young when I met Robert, but I knew then that I really wanted to be a mum, and because he was from such a big family himself, he was keen to have children too.

‘We’d been trying for two years and each month I would be devastated when I hadn’t fallen pregnant.

‘I’d only ever wanted to be a mum and that dream was being taken away from me. It was very hard to accept.’

Mrs Young was given a drug to help stimulate her ovaries. Despite the fact that she did not hold much hope of the treatment working, she became pregnant with her first son Nico, now 17.

A year later and desperate to conceive a brother or sister for baby Nico, Mrs Young booked a doctor’s appointment, thinking she might need to go back on the medication.

But she never went because she discovered she was pregnant with second son Gianni.

Mrs Young, who works for the NHS as a support worker, said: ‘It was such a surprise.

‘Nothing had happened for a year, then just before I was due to start taking the drug again, I fell pregnant without any help at all. Once I gave birth to Gianni, the babies didn’t stop coming.

‘When I fell pregnant with my first baby, I thought I’d just been very lucky. To have had ten children despite what the doctors told me, it really seems like a miracle.’

The family live in their four-bedroom terrace home in Scarborough and use a 15-seater minibus to get around.

But they may have to find a bigger house soon as Mrs Young hopes to have another child.

She said: ‘I’d always wanted a family of five, but we just kept going. I’d like to have another one. Then I’d have enough for a whole football team.

‘People do stare at us when we go out as a family – you can see them counting the heads in disbelief.

‘I love my big family – and I certainly proved the doctors wrong.’
