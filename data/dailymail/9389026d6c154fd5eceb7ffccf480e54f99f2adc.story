South Korean soldiers have arrested an
American man discovered swimming in a river leading to North Korea in the hope of meeting Kim Jong-un.

Marines guarding the Han river, which flows into an estuary and meets the North's Imjin river, found the man lying on the bank suffering from exhaustion, local media reported.

The unidentified man, who is believed to be in his late 20s or early 30s, later told South Korean authorities he had been trying to get to North Korea in the hope of meeting its leader, Kim Jong-un.

North and South Korea are technically still at war after their 1950-53 conflict ended in a truce and not a peace treaty.

The border between the two countries is one of the most heavily militarised in the world and unauthorised bids to cross it can spark clashes.

South Korea's defence ministry could not immediately confirm
details of the report but an official said an American man was
picked up by the military late last night and was being
questioned.

The U.S. embassy in Seoul said it had been in contact with
South Korean authorities about the report.

'We do not have any additional information to share at this
time. We have been in touch with the appropriate South Korean
authorities regarding the reports,' embassy spokeswoman Nida
Emmons said by email. 

No entry: The border between North and South Korea is one of the most heavily militarised in the world and unauthorised bids to cross it can spark clashes

The incident comes after a young American man who tore up his own tourist visa on landing in North Korea and demanded to be arrested so that he could experience prison life in the communist nation was sentenced to six years hard labor for entering the country illegally to commit espionage.

Matthew Miller, 24, of Bakersfield, California, looked thin and pale at his trial in Pyongyang on Sunday, as he was handed out his sentence.

Showing no emotion throughout the proceedings, Miller waived the right to a lawyer and was handcuffed before being led from the courtroom after his sentencing.

Earlier, it had been believed that Miller had sought asylum when he entered North Korea.

During the trial, however, the prosecution argued that was a ruse and that Miller also falsely claimed to have secret information about the U.S. military in South Korea on his iPad and iPod.

Miller was charged under Article 64 of the North Korean criminal code, which is for espionage and can carry a sentence of five to 10 years, though harsher punishments can be given for more serious cases. 

He is one of three Americans now being held in North Korea.

There have been no cases of Americans entering North Korea
from the South without legal authorisation in recent years.

A South Korean man was shot and killed by South Korean
soldiers in September while he was apparently trying to enter
the North by floating across a border river.
