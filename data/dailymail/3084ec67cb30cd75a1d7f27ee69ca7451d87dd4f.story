Controversial: Nutritionist Pierre Dukan has been struck off as a doctor in France after he was accused of giving dangerous advice to teenagers

A diet guru whose fans include the Duchess of Cambridge's mother has been struck off the medical register in France after being accused of misadvising teenagers.

Pierre Dukan, 70, asked to be removed from the doctors’ list at his own request because he was facing disciplinary action.

The nutritionist had used a book to propose ideal weights for 17 and 18 year-old school pupils, giving them extra exam marks if they kept to them.

It led to a formal complaint from the College of Physicians in Paris, who said that the scheme could lead to increased cases of obesity and anorexia.

The physicians said Dukan’s proposal was in breach of article 13 of the medical ethics code which states: ‘A doctor must be aware of the repercussions his views can have on the public.’

There was also an allegation that Dukan’s £80 million plus slimming business might be in breach of medical codes.

But Dukan insisted that the advice contained in his best-selling books was all part of a doctor’s right to freedom of expression.

Dukan had retired as a medical practitioner anyway, and so insisted that the disciplinary proceedings were void.

Now medical ethics chiefs have told La Croix newspaper that Dukan asked to be struck off the register on April 19.

Dr Irene Kahn-Bensaude, head of the Paris branch of the Physicians’ College, said: ‘I think he made this decision when he saw things were not going his way in medical ethics circles.’

She suggested that Dukan’s move was part of a damage limitation exercise because a guilty verdict might damage his diet guru business.

And Dr Kahn-Bensaude insisted that Dukan’s move would not halt the disciplinary action against him, and that charges ‘will go all the way’.

Last year experts from the British Dietetic Association named the Dukan Diet the worst celebrity weight loss plan, saying it has 'absolutely no solid science behind it at all'.

The Dukan Diet is said to be followed by the Duchess of Cambridge’s mother Carole Middleton, as well as Jennifer Lopez, supermodel Gisele Bundchen and Welsh singer Katherine Jenkins.

It has also been suggested that the Duchess of Cambridge has also followed the controversial diet.

It is a complicated four-phase diet that starts with a protein-only approach which promotes weight loss of around 7lb per week.

It topped the BDA's annual list of the five worst celebrity diets to avoid in the New Year.

It works on restricting foods, calories and portion control. However, the BDA says cutting out food groups is not advisable.

The BDA said: 'This diet is so confusing, very rigid, full of very French foods that most Brits would run a mile from like rabbit and offal, and even Dr Dukan himself warns of the associated problems like lack of energy, constipation and bad breath.'
