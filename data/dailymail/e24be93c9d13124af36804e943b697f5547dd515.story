A grandmother is a person of interest in a police investigation into the 'mindboggling' murders of two of her grandchildren and the attempted killing of two other grandkids by fire as they slept in their beds.

The crimes all occurred at the same home in Morayfield, on the Sunshine Coast in Queensland's south, on the 27th day of three different months. Detectives said the children's grandmother was present at each incident. No one has been charged.

The deaths of a three-year-old child, who was found at the home on July 27 2013, and a seven-month-old, who was found dead at the same address on September 27 2014, were initially treated as SIDS (Sudden Infant Death Syndrome) cases, police said.

The alleged crimes all occurred at a home in Morayfield, toward the Sunshine Coast north of Brisbane

Earlier this year, two other grandchildren - a nine-year-old and an 11-year-old - were asleep in their beds on February 27 2014 when part of the house was set ablaze.

The children survived but based on a forensic recreation of the arson attack, detectives believe someone had deliberately blocked their escape pathway from the bedroom.  

Detective Acting Superintendent Damien Hansen said the crimes were horrific. 'To have it happen to defenceless children is just mindboggling,' he told reporters on Friday evening.

Supt Hansen would not identify any family members. Both children and other occupants of the burning house were treated for smoke inhalation. 

'The children were inside the room and could not exit the room,' he said. One child suffered burns to their lower limbs and were treated at Caboolture Hospital.

Police are investigating whether there is a reason why the crimes all occurred on the 27th of the month, Supt Hansen said. 

'It's a matter being investigated,' he said, although he ruled out any religious or cult links to the crimes.

The detective would not rule out the involvement of other people but said police have 'strong leads'.

'We are very confident we have the right line of enquiry with this investigation and will have a conclusion in the near future,' he said.  

The surviving kids are currently in the care of the Department of Community Services. 

Police are calling for anyone with information that could help the investigation or witnessed the house fire on February 27 and the early hours of February 28 to contact CrimeStoppers on 1800 333 000.
