Most children could look forward to a slice of birthday cake on their third birthdays, but when Zeq Caalim celebrates in July, he'll have to settle for ice chips.

The toddler from Virginia Beach, Virginia has a rare condition that has left him allergic to all food and reliant on a feeding tube for nourishment.

After breaking out in severe rashes, he was diagnosed with Eosinophilic Esophagitis, also known as EOE, a rare condition where white blood cells attack food as a foreign object.

When he started drinking formula as a baby, he began breaking into the rashes and frantically itching his body, leaving him with dry, broken skin, his mother Kristine told Fox Baltimore.

'When I walked into the room when he was
sleeping, the room smelled like blood,' Kristine said, becoming emotional. 'Every single time I walked into 
the room it just smelled like blood.'

As they began introducing other foods into his diet, he would vomit and have trouble swallowing.

The family was eventually sent to Johns Hopkins 
in Baltimore where Zeq was diagnosed with the condition and fitted with a backpack carrying the feeding tube.

Little Zeq has been diagnosed with Eosinophilic Esophagitis (EOE), an allergic inflammatory condition of the esophagus, the tube that connects the mouth to the stomach.

The condition is caused when a type of white blood cell (eosinophil) builds up in the esophagus as a reaction to foods or allergens. They attack the foods, rather than allowing them to be ingested. As they build up, the eosinophils can inflame or injure the tissue, causing swallowing problems.

It can be treated with modifying the diet to exclude certain foods, by taking steroid medications to reduce the swelling or by mechanically dilating the esophagus.

EOE was only discovered in recent years so little is known about its exact cause.

But he's not going through the ordeal alone; as well as the swarms of doctors, nurses, relatives and neighbors offering their support, he also has 'Tubey', a toy bear who has a matching feeding tube.

He is now able to eat certain fresh fruits and vegetables, but he still gets rashes that make him 
scratch all day and leave him with dry skin.

But for other nutritional needs, he uses the feeding tube, which costs the family $2,400 after insurance.

'It's a little troubling, but we are making it through,' his mother told WAVY, adding that a recent fundraiser at the Confetti Cafe in Virginia Beach raised $2,663.

The family, which includes Zeq's big sister Mia, said they hoped that the event would raise awareness of the disease.

'A
lot of those people had told me that they know somebody who might have 
the same disease, or may have had the same disease and outgrew it,' 
Kristine said.

His condition is caused when a type of white blood cell, called an eosinophil, builds up in the esophagus
as a reaction to foods or allergens.

Prepared: He is fed through a tube connected to his backpack - but it costs $2,400 a month to maintain

They attack the foods, rather than
allowing them to be ingested. As they build up, the eosinophils can 
inflame or injure the tissue, causing swallowing problems.
