New signing Emmanuel Riviere was seen getting stuck in during training as Newcastle's tour of New Zealand kicks off tomorrow.

The 24-yer-old scored 14 goals for Monaco last season before Alan Pardew paid £6m for the Frenchman.

Swapping Monte Carlo for Tyneside will could provide a culture shock, but with such a large French contingent at Newcastle there will be plenty of teammates that can help him settle.

The Magpies are currently on tour in New Zealand and manager Pardew said it was an important step to growing the club's reputation abroad.

The 53-year-old told the Newcastle Chronicle: 'It is important for us to grow our brand, we’re a club that wants to compete in the Champions League.

'We are trying to do it in a way that’s very difficult, because we’re not throwing vast fortunes at transfers.

'We can’t afford to do that, so we are trying to do it in a more educated way.

'Trying to bring in players that we think can make that step. This year we are as well set as at any time that I’ve been at the club.'
