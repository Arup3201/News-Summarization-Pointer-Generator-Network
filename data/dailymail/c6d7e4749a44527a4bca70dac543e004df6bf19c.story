A disabled mother claimed today she was ‘humiliated’ after being stopped from boarding a bus when the driver asked her to prove how much her wheelchair weighed.

Samantha Hemes, 22, was waiting for the service in Hereford with her 11-month-old daughter Amelia Rose and mother Christine Bonsall, 48, on Saturday afternoon.

But she was left in tears after the driver of a number 74 bus that pulled up allegedly refused to allow her on the vehicle unless she could prove her wheelchair weighed below 300kg (660lbs).

Miss Hemes claimed she removed the child seat adaptor from the chair but the First bus driver still banned her from boarding - and eventually drove off, leaving them all by the roadside. 

The mother, who suffers from dystonia - a condition which causes muscle spasms and contractions - said the ordeal was the first time she had suffered such an incident.

She added: ‘My mum was trying to get the ramp down so I could get on the bus and the driver wouldn’t help. Then he said he thought I was too heavy and needed a certificate to prove I wasn’t.

‘I was really embarrassed and humiliated. I was mortified by his attitude. I didn’t want to cry and normally don’t cry that easily - but it was really embarrassing in front of lots of people.

‘After that, another driver came to help me and made sure I got on the next bus. He is still working as I’ve seen him driving around, but I want something done so it does not happen again.

‘I want an apology at the very least. I have been left feeling very humiliated and it has put me off catching buses in future.’

The family had been waiting for the 2.12pm service from a Tesco store in Hereford back to their home in the Newton Farm area of the city when the incident occurred. 

West Mercia Police is investigating the incident, and has urged any witnesses to get in touch.

Karen Pardoe, 40, who saw the incident while shopping in the city, said: ‘You can’t treat somebody like he did. I have been sat here looking at the conditions of carriage on the bus.

‘There’s nothing in the policy stating that it has to be of a certain weight or anything. I would rather not use the bus if that’s how someone was allowed to talk to me.’

A First Bus spokesman said the firm was undertaking a ‘full investigation’ into the circumstances - and apologised to Miss Hemes.

He said: ‘From the information provided so far, it seems that our driver at the time of the incident did not deliver anywhere near the standard of customer service or assistance that we would expect from our staff.

‘I can assure the lady concerned that we are taking this matter very seriously. In response to the accusation of discrimination against wheelchair users, this is absolutely not correct.

‘We do not discriminate against anyone using our buses. We have manual ramps fitted that should be opened and closed by the driver to allow easy access for wheelchairs onto the bus.

‘This incident was obviously upsetting to the lady concerned at the time and we would like to apologise for the insensitivity and unprofessional approach allegedly given by the driver at the time.’

A West Mercia Police spokesman said: ‘We were made aware of this incident.

'We were called at 5pm on February 21 to a complaint that a woman had been denied boarding a bus due to the speculation of the weight of her wheelchair.

‘Police later visited the woman involved and established that no further police investigation is required, and the bus company will be dealing with this independently.’
