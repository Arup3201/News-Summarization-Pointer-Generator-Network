This is the pretty brunette is accused of throwing a punch during the charity boxing match 

This is the face of a pretty brunette wanted by police after punches were thrown during a mass brawl at a police charity boxing match.

The woman is alleged to have thrown a punch after the violence erupted in the audience at  Wolverhampton's Civic Hall.

Three men were arrested on suspicion of affray at the scene of the fundraiser - which had seen a police boxing team take on members from a local boxing club.  

The trouble started at around 11pm after an argument broke out between some audience members which led to punches being thrown in the crowd.

West Midlands Police have now released an image of a woman they want to speak to in connection with the disorder.

The attractive brunette - who can be seen in formal wear smiling at the camera on the night of the event - is believed to have swung at least one punch during the fracas on October 18.

Detective Constable Narinder Sandhu, from West Midlands Police, said: 'This was an event to raise money for a disability charity - between a police boxing team and a group of local boxers - and it is a shame that some members of the audience decided to start their own match outside of the ring.

'We've arrested a number of people already in connection with the offence and two others have been voluntarily interviewed about it.

'There is one woman though who we suspect may have also thrown a punch during the disorder.

'Despite our best efforts, we have been unable to identify her and I would urge anyone who knows her to get in touch.'

Police said nobody came forward to say they were hurt but a number of people reported witnessing the violence - causing them to fear for their safety.

Anyone with information is asked to call police on 101 or the independent charity Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
