Delayed: New mother Rachel Rodger gave birth to Luke, aged three weeks, in a hospital car park after a police road block delayed her journey

A mother was forced to give birth in a dark hospital car park after her dash to the labour ward was delayed by two police road blocks.

Rachel Rodger and her husband Jason had to stop and answer officers’ questions at one of the roadblocks despite the expectant woman being in the advanced stages of labour.

When the couple finally made it to Perth Royal Infirmary at around 4am, Mrs Rodger did not have time to go inside as she started giving birth to son Luke when she got out of the car.

The 26-year-old said: ‘My husband ran to press the intercom and asked for the midwife to come down. My legs gave way, I was on my knees on the tarmac and the baby’s head came.

‘I was screaming and panicking. Thankfully I had a towel with me because I was worried he was going to drop on to the tarmac.’

Last night the new mother, who lives in Coupar Angus, Perthshire, told how their trip to hospital had been held up by the Tayside Police roadblocks.

They had been set up in the early hours of May 13 following a break-in at a shop in Scone, Perthshire. All vehicles on the surrounding roads were stopped and their occupants questioned.

Mrs Rodger had already been in the hospital a few hours earlier but was sent home because staff did not feel the birth was likely that night.

However, in the early hours she was painfully aware that the arrival was imminent. When the couple set off from home they expected the journey to take half an hour.

Mrs Rodger, who works for a coach firm, said they first had to wait until police had stopped talking to the occupants of a car in front. Her husband told officers at the outset that they were hurrying to the hospital but they insisted on asking all of their questions.

She added: ‘When we got to Scone, we got stopped and my husband shouted out to the police officers that I was in labour.

‘They still stopped us and asked lots of details like my name, address, date of birth and place of birth.

‘They then asked what our purpose for being on the road was, even though I was clearly in labour – why else would we be on the road at four in the morning?’

On entering Perth, they came to a second roadblock, but this time police recognised the urgency of the situation and they were allowed through. 

Unhappy: Rachel Rodger said she was very frightened about the safety of her baby during the birth

Help on hand: A midwife from Perth Royal Infirmary helped Mrs Rodger give birth in the hospital car park

Mrs Rodger said: ‘We did get an apology from the police but I don’t think it was much of an apology.

‘I was panicking and having to stop myself from pushing. I had had a child before and I knew what was coming. When we got to the hospital and I stood up from the car, I just couldn’t go any further.’

A midwife alerted by Mr Rodger helped to deliver her baby in the car park.

Mrs Rodger said: ‘They had to cut the cord in the dark, I was very frightened. Afterwards I realised people in the houses round about must have all been looking out of their windows wondering what was going on and why I was screaming.

‘I was terrified being on my own in the dark, it wasn’t nice. We are so lucky everything is okay but what if there had been any complications? What if the baby’s cord had been wrapped around its head?’

Mrs Rodger’s mother, Isobel Hindmarch, later wrote to Tayside Police to complain, telling them the delay could have had tragic consequences if there had been complications with the birth.

The trained nurse said: ‘I’m very angry about what my daughter went through. Every second counts if you’re expecting a speedy delivery.

‘It should have been clear to the officer at Scone that Rachel needed to be waved through immediately.’

Responding to Mrs Hindmarch’s complaint, Inspector Ian Martin, of Tayside Police’s community policing division, apologised for the incident.

He said: ‘It is a matter of great regret that our actions, intended to affect the arrest of those responsible for a break-in to a premises in Scone, resulted in a delay in your daughter getting to Perth Royal Infirmary.

‘I offer my apologies if the delay in being stopped at the road block impacted on  subsequent events and for any anxiety or distress caused to your daughter.’
