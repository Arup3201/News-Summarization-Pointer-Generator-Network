The son of Australia's richest woman Gina Rinehart called his youngest sister an 'oxygen thief', a Sydney court has heard in the latest battle over control of the family's $5billion trust.

John Hancock made the comments about Ginia Rinehart, who has sided with her mother against her siblings, the NSW Supreme Court heard on Tuesday.

Gina has has been embroiled in an ongoing feud with three of her four children, John, Bianca and Hope, over the family fortune left by her father, mining magnate Lang Hancock.

Bianca Rinehart, the eldest daughter of Australia's richest woman Gina Rinehart, appeared at Sydney's Supreme Court on Tuesday to argue why she should be allowed to take control of a $5 billion family trust

Appearing as the first witness in the case, lodged three years ago, Bianca Rinehart defended her brother's comments, despite having told her mother in 2004 she was 'deeply concerned about (his) reckless bite the hand that feeds you approach'.

Bianca, who had temporarily fallen out with Mr Hancock, told the court: '(It's) not a personal attack.'

She added that her brother's drinking and gambling problems had been 'damaging in the past'.

'He doesn't want to see the family business left in the hands of someone ... he feels isn't up to the job,' she said.

The contempt Mr Hancock had for Ginia 
was born of worry about who would be 'assuming real and great 
responsibility of taking over the family company', according to Bianca.

She and Mr Hancock have since reconciled, with Mr Hancock backing her bid to take charge of the family's $5 billion trust.

The
 court heard their mother Gina reportedly sent Olympic swimmer Grant 
Hackett an email encouraging him to convince  Bianca to withdraw her bid
 to control the trust rather 'than be found a liar in the witness box', 
the Sydney Morning Herald reported.

He later forwarded the email to his friend Bianca.

The youngest Rinehart, Ginia, was not the only one who angered her older brother.

Bianca,
 Ms Rinehart's eldest daughter, also said her younger sister Hope Welker 'was
 pretty much at her wit's end' and felt 'kicked in the stomach' after 
the way she was treated by Mr Hancock.

John Hancock called his youngest sister, Ginia, an 'oxygen thief'. Bianca Rinehart told the court this contempt was born out of worry over who would assume 'real and great responsibility' for the family company

Mr Hancock and Bianca allege their mother Gina acted 'deceitfully' and with 'gross dishonesty' in her dealings with the trust, set up in 1988 by her father, Lang Hancock, with her children as the beneficiaries

Bianca told the court that Hope had emailed her brother in February 2013 saying: 'All
 I feel is pain and anxiety. You are kicking me in the stomach.'

Ms
 Welker has withdrawn from the protracted legal debate for control of 
the family trust, distressed at the way it was proceeding, and dealing 
with her own divorce.

Mr Hancock and Bianca allege their 
mother acted 'deceitfully' and with 'gross dishonesty' in her dealings 
with the trust, set up in 1988 by her father, Lang Hancock, with her 
children as the beneficiaries.

So
 far, every proposal for a replacement trustee - including Bianca, Mr 
Hancock and independent trustees - has been knocked out of contention 
during lengthy court proceedings.
