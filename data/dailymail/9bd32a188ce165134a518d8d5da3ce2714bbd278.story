Rules for buying working antique guns that are currently slacker than laws for dealing scrap metal are to be toughened up in a bid to stem criminals’ access to deadly weapons.

Changes coming into force tomorrow will stop convicts being able to buy or possess old weapons, and by the end of the year dealers will have to keep computerised records for at least 20 years.

Police have long expressed concern that criminal gangs are buying and using antique guns that are still capable of firing, and getting ammunition made to fit the firearms.

A legal loophole allowing criminals to buy and sell antique guns such as these is now closed

These included the killers of soldier Lee Rigby - Michael Adebowale and Michael Adebolajo - who had an unloaded rusty Dutch KNIL 9.4mm revolver that was 90 years old.

Detective 
Chief Superintendent Gordon Allison, who leads Scotland Yard’s Trident 
Gang Crime Command, said violent criminals are exploiting existing 
loopholes in the law.

Crackdowns
 on the importation of more modern weapons have caused criminals to 
resort to buying old guns, and to try to use the antique laws to avoid 
arrest.

He
 said: 'We welcome these additional new controls for an area of firearms
 trade that until now has been unregulated. Previously the laws for 
dealing scrap metal have been stricter than those for dealing antique 
guns.

'We
 are not talking about converted weapons here - these sought after, 
collectable items are capable of firing live ammunition, and criminals, 
in particular gang members have exploited the loopholes in the law.

'These
 changes will enable police to ensure our resources are focused on those
 people who do not have a genuine reason to possess these weapons and 
those involved in gun-related criminality.'

Crime prevention minister Norman Baker said he wanted the UK's strong gun laws to remain effective

Crime 
prevention minister Norman Baker said: 'We are introducing a new offence
 of possession of a prohibited weapon or ammunition for sale or 
transfer, which will carry a maximum penalty of life imprisonment, and 
we are increasing the maximum sentence for the international trade of a 
weapon or ammunition from 10 years to life imprisonment.

'We are also ensuring people prohibited from possessing a firearm are banned from owning an antique firearm.

'The
 UK has some of the toughest gun laws in the world and I am determined 
to keep it that way. The trade in illegal firearms and misuse of legal 
firearms endangers lives, that is why we are taking extra steps to 
improve public safety.'

Director
 of Public Prosecutions Alison Saunders has already issued new guidance 
to prosecutors dealing with such cases and warned that criminals will no
 longer be able to abuse the law.

The
 changes mean that anyone who has been given a suspended sentence of 
three months or more will no longer be able to buy or possess an antique
 gun or ammunition for five years.

As well as the changes to antique gun laws, a new offence of possession for sale or transfer of a prohibited weapon or ammunition is being created, which will carry a maximum life term.

The manufacture, sale or transfer of a prohibited weapon or ammunition will now carry a new maximum penalty of life imprisonment, as will the manufacture, sale or transfer of prohibited firearms and ammunition without authority, and their import or export.
