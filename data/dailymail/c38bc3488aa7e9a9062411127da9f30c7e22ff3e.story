'Can you have sex for me this weekend?' As far as requests from the boss go this has to be up there with the weirdest - or best.

My mission? To put Superdrug's new sexercise workout to the test. New research shows that the average British couple has sex for 22 minutes and 48 seconds and so the health-conscious brand has released a 23-minute track designed to burn calories while you heat up between the bed sheets.

My editor doesn't know this (I hope) but I have been on the lookout for some new sexy time soundtracks for a while now. It's not going well.

Toni Jones tried Superdrug's new sexercise CD in the hope of boosting her fitness between the sheets

I have cringing memories of attempting a drunken striptease to the Black Keys after the Christmas party, and a recent demand for my husband to put on some kinky tunes resulted in him buckling under the pressure and choosing a Rumer album. Great for the bedroom if you're a frisky 90-year-old I imagine. 

Late night radio is often a bit creepy and a Spotify search for 'sexy' playlists brings up hundreds of hours of lame R&B that wouldn't even give Russell Brand the horn. 

So maybe this 'music track sex aid' could be the answer? I like music, I like sex, and I'm starting to like exercise so what a brilliant excuse to combine all three in the name of work/investigative reporting...

GETTING DOWN TO BUSINESS

There's something terribly teenage about putting on a record then being expected to feel frisky, but after an awkward minute or so we soon remembered why we were in the bedroom.

After some serious kissing, my new (decidedly un-sporty) underwear started to fall off, and it was about five minutes in that the magic happened... my husband pressed stop on the stereo.

The problem was not that we felt unsexy trying to get fit, it's that the music is just plain awful. Totally naff. Beyond naff.

Toni said the music speeding up introduced a bit of cardio - as well as fits of laughter to the bedroom

It's 23 minutes of cheap synthesizer sounds that went out of fashion around the same time as porn movies starring dungaree-wearing plumbers. 

Most modern women - and men apparently - have some standards in the bedroom, and that applies to the music they're listening to as well as their chosen partner.

Instead of boosting our sex session, this 'sex aid' totally killed it and left me thinking that I would have burnt more calories walking to the pub (and probably had better sex afterwards).

DOES IT WORK AS A WORKOUT?

Determined to see the 23 minutes through to the end (and not to have to go to Spinning the next day) I gave it another go wearing headphones so that my husband wouldn't have to perform to 'awful Eighties lift music'. 

Wearing headphones while naked has its own limitations, but we eventually got into the swing of things.

Toni's husband called the track, which was created with the help of fitness experts, 'awful Eighties lift music'.

I decided to treat it like a normal workout, focusing on different parts of my body as the track went on, and holding certain positions or counting 20 reps of particular moves, and I did start to feel the burn on thighs, arms and stomach at various points. 

But shouldn't that happen anyway if you're trying hard enough?

The music speeding up introduced a bit of cardio, as well as fits of laughter. The tricep dips were interesting/eye-opening. 

And while it wasn't exactly a HIIT workout it was enough to get my heart rate going and the morning after I definitely felt a bit of satisfying muscle soreness in my thighs and arms.

Superdrug says the piece, which is free to download, is designed to sync with 'calorie-burning sex sessions'

THE VERDICT

YES! Yes? Er, no.

There is nothing sexy about lift music and if you have even a smidgen of musical taste I defy you to get in the mood to this synth-heavy soundtrack.

Any way to squeeze a bit more exercise into the week has to be a good thing. And 80 per cent of couples say they would change their sexual routine if it helped them lose weight. 

But I think the answer to this might be just to have more sex, people. Workouts are called WORKouts for a reason and - even ignoring the naff notes of the track - reminding myself to hold positions or try harder in the name of fitness rather than the heat of the moment meant that sex felt almost like a chore and certainly a lot less intimate. 

Trying to keep up with the song's tempo sometimes interrupted the natural rhythm of things and it's not very romantic to hear your partner counting reps under their breath.

Throughout the 23-minute session I kept hearing the Prince lyrics '23 positions in a one night stand' in my head, and I can't help but think that would be a lot more fun and a much better workout.
