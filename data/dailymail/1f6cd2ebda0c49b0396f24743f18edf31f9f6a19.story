Vulnerable: Gareth Williams (above) may have left himself open to blackmail after making illicit searches on secret MI6 files, his inquest heard

An illegal party drug was found in tests on body-in-the-bag spy Gareth  Williams, an inquest heard yesterday.

Scientists said their investigation revealed a small trace of GHB, a dangerous sedative popular in the clubbing and gay scene.

They also refused to rule out poisoning because Mr Williams’s body was so decomposed that a host of potential killing agents including cyanide, insulin and chloroform would have been undetectable.

The spy’s family fear the failure of MI6 bosses to raise the alarm for seven days after he went missing deprived police of opportunities to solve the riddle of his death in August 2010.

His body quickly began to decay after being padlocked inside a sports holdall in the bath of his Pimlico flat in central London.

His curled-up, naked body was found uninjured and he did not try to escape.

The fourth day of the inquest into his death also heard the high-flying code-breaker’s eccentric private life was no barrier to his secret work.

A senior MI6 officer suggested his superiors knew about his collection of women’s designer clothing, love of transvestite comedy and visits to bondage websites.

Speaking from behind a screen, a top official, known only as SIS F, said Mr Williams was known for his ‘world class’ work at GCHQ, the Government listening post.

The family’s lawyer Anthony O’Toole asked SIS F whether ‘revelations about Gareth’s private life might have rendered him unsuitable’ for MI6.

She replied: ‘There is no set template for what their lifestyle should be.

'Individuals have lifestyle and sexual choices and preferences which are perfectly legitimate.’

The inquest heard Mr Williams made a 
‘small number’ of illicit searches on the MI6 database that could have 
left him vulnerable to blackmail by foreign agents.

But colleagues said there was no evidence he was targeted by a foreign power.

His family fear the ‘dark arts’ of the
secret services may have been involved in his death or in a cover-up.

The MI6 officer apologised for the failure to act when punctual and 
reliable Mr Williams did not show for work.

Unsolved: Coroner Fiona Wilcox has said that 
whether Mr Williams was alive inside the North Face bag like this one 
and locked it himself 'was at the very heart of this inquiry'

Mystery: Mr Williams was found dead locked 
inside a holdall in the bath of his flat

Family members stormed out of the 
hearing sobbing after Mr O’Toole accused the secret service of ‘total 
disregard’ for his safety.

Denise Stanworth, a forensic 
scientist, said samples from Mr Williams’s body had been subjected to 
almost every test imaginable for evidence of suspicious substances and 
none was found.

Speaking about the party drug, she 
said she could not completely rule out that the spy had taken GHB but in
her opinion it was unlikely.

She said it was far more likely to have been produced naturally following death.

The inquest continues.

Being tracked? Mr Williams is caught on CCTV in Holland Park on August 14, 2010, just over a week before his naked and decomposing body was found locked in a bag in his Pimlico flat

Suspicions: Mr Williams' body is taken out of his flat. Relatives believe a third party was either present when Gareth Williams died or broke into his home afterwards to destroy evidence
