Alan Pardew says the days of giving sympathy penalties to Papiss Cisse are long gone – and believes the striker is back to his free-scoring best.

The Newcastle frontman has a habit of hitting hot streaks in front of goal, evidenced by his four from three this season and 13 in 12 following his arrival on Tyneside in January 2012.

But Cisse has also endured some barren spells and skied a penalty given to him by his team-mates during one such dry run two seasons ago.

Newcastle United manager Alan Pardew believes Papiss Cisse is back to his best form - the striker has four goals in three appearances this season

Pardew, though, is confident that the 29-year-old is ready to resume his goals trail when United – still in the bottom three and without a win this term – entertain Leicester City this afternoon.

‘He is a natural goalscorer, we see that on the training ground,’ said the Magpies boss.

‘There have been times when it hasn't been so natural for him. With all goalscorers they go through those periods, but certainly at the moment he has looked very sharp in training.

‘When goalscorers get their tails up, they have an unbelievable knack of finding a goal.

‘The first goal at Swansea (2-2 draw earlier this month), I don’t think there is anyone else on our staff who could have scored that goal, and that is what I mean by finding a technique that gets you a goal.

‘He does that on the training ground on a more regular basis when he is in form, like now, than he did in that period (when team-mates gave him the penalty).’

Cisse – who scored both goals to rescue a point at Swansea - has been away on international duty with Senegal for the past fortnight and only returned to training yesterday.

Pardew, though, has no hesitation about starting him against Nigel Pearson’s side.

‘I don't think it's a risk to play him,’ he said. ‘I think he is injury-free for the first time in a long time, because at the back end of last year he was carrying knocks and fatigue a little bit.

‘He is more enthused this year than I have seen him for a long time, and that's being reflected in his goals.’

Pardew, meanwhile, admits his players need the home fans on side as they bid to avoid becoming the first United team to go eight matches without a win from the start of a Premier League campaign.

‘It is such an important game for us and for everybody at this football club,’ he added.

‘I hope it is an atmosphere that gives the players the chance to win this game. I can’t tell you how committed we are to try and get the win for them.’
