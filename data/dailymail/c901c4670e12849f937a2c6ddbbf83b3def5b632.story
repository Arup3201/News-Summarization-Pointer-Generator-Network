Crystal Escobar got a pleasant surprise on Friday night when
a halftime ceremony to recognize the success of Van Horn High School's cheer
team in Kansas City, MO. turned into a marriage proposal

‘This is one of those things I want to be perfect,’ Crystal’s boyfriend Trevor Julo from Lee’s Summit, MO. told The Kansas City Star.

Esobar, from Independent, MO, and Julo met only eight months
ago.  The couple met on a double date at
a place called 810 Zone.  Escobar is
originally from Los, Angeles, CA.

Van Horn High School cheerleaders helped pop the question On Friday night when Trevor Julo proposed to Crystal Escobar

The halftime ceremony was all a cover for Trevor’s elaborate
proposal. When Trevor thought of the idea to surprise Crystal, he called up the
principal and athletic director at the high school and they agreed to help him
pop the big question, ‘will you marry me?’

The cheerleaders performed their halftime routine as usual and
the school’s principal, Patrick Layden, presented Escobar with a bouquet of
flowers which she thought was to honor her cheer team’s success.

To her surprise, ‘Never Stop,’ by Safety Suit began to play
and the crowd couldn’t stop cheering as the cheerleaders held up their sign’s
reading ‘Will you marry me?

Layden dropped to one knee.  Crystal Escobar shouted, ‘yes!’ and the couple
held each other closely.

‘You have to leave it in other people’s hands and have faith
that they are going to do the right thing at the right time and everything
falls into place,’ said Julo of his plan.

According to Crystal, the engagement couldn’t have been more
perfect. ‘I’m a pretty critical person, but I wouldn’t change anything about
that proposal. It was absolutely perfect and absolutely me.’

She continued by saying, ‘It seems kind of weird, but it
really fits for us, because my life really changed when I got this job here and
the cheerleaders are like my family,’ Escobar said

Crystal’s connection to the cheer squad is a very important
part of her life. She is also an invaluable member of the school’s faculty.

 According to the
Layden, the school principal, ‘We had a good cheerleading program before she
came, but she’s really turned it around. The kids really have a real strong
sense of teamwork, and it’s her that caused it.’

For the first time in years The Falcons qualified for the
state meet and finished seventh out of 11 in their class last season.

‘I’m here all the time; this is like where I live so it
makes sense to do it here with everyone I love. Being in front of everybody was
kind of nerve-racking, but it was still good,’ said Crystal of her pleasant
surprise.

The engagement was truly a family affair, and Julo took it
upon himself to Crystal’s and his family to the event. They hid behind the bleachers
so as not to ruin Crystal’s surprise.
