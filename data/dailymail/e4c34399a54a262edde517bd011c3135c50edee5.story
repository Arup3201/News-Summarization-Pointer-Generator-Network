Only 48 per cent now back the death penalty for ‘some crimes’, down from 54 per cent in 2013, according to a NatCen British Social Attitudes study.

Public support for the death penalty has fallen below 50 per cent, a survey has found.

Only 48 per cent now back the death penalty for ‘some crimes’, down from 54 per cent in 2013, according to a NatCen British Social Attitudes study. 

It is the first time that support has fallen below 50 per cent since NatCen began asking the public for its views on capital punishment in 1986.

Support for the death penalty stood at 74 per cent in 1986 but had fallen to 59 per cent by 1998, according to the social research institute.

The survey also found that at present Ukip voters are more likely to support the death penalty, with 75 per cent in favour. 

Rachel Ormston, co-head of social attitudes at NatCen, said: “The big change in public attitudes to the death penalty came in the 1990s at a time when attitudes to a range of other issues, like same-sex relationships and sex before marriage were also liberalising.

“This more recent change is interesting because attitudes have stayed fairly steady for a number of years.

“It could be the continuation of this liberalising trend or, perhaps, a response to the shocking botched executions in the United States that were widely reported in April and July of last year.”

Clare Algar, executive director of the legal charity Reprieve, said: “This welcome finding finally debunks the myth that, given half the chance, the British people would vote to bring back hanging.

“In fact, the trend is clear. Brits in increasing numbers agree that the death penalty has no place in a civilised society.

“Capital punishment has little to do with justice or crime deterrence, and all countries, including the UK, should be working towards global abolition.”

In one incident in the US last April, 38-year-old convicted murderer Clayton Lockett died 43 minutes after his lethal injection process began in Oklahoma.

In July of that year, another controversial US execution took place involving convicted killer Joseph Wood, 55, who took two hours to die following the start of his lethal injection process at Florence State Prison in Arizona. The process should normally take around 10 minutes.
