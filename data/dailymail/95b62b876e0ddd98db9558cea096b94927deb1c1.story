He's the determined young koala who survived an 80km ride clinging to the front grille of a car in Queensland - and remarkably escaped with just a bruised nose and scratch toe nail.

The four-year-old koala was hit on Thursday around Marborough, north of the Sunshine Coast, and was spotted still hanging onto the car when it pulled into a service station at Gypmie 88km away. 

A taxi driver took the 5.75kg koala from the driver of the car and drove him to a nearby vet clinic, before he was taken to Australia Zoo on Friday to be treated.

The zoo's vet, Dr Rebecca Millers, said she's never seen such a tale of koala survival in her three years at Australia Zoo.

'He's clung on to the front of the car for about 80km. It's incredible that he's survived,' Dr Millers told Daily Mail Australia.

'The driver felt a thump on the front of the car but kept going until they reached Gympie when they needed to fill up with petrol. They've got out of the car and a koala has crawled out.'

Dr Millers said the koala had been named 'Timber Wolf' because he was brought to the zoo by the men who collect leaves for the animals.

She said the furry marsupial would have been hit while he was searching for a mate.

The zoo treats about 900 koalas each year and most of them injure themselves between July and December when they're on the move searching for a mate during the breeding season.

'He’s recovering well but we need to know where to return him. He's very lucky to be alive,' Dr Millers said. 

The zoo want to track down the driver to work out where the koala was hit in a bid to return him to the correct area on the Sunshine Coast.

'Koalas are territorial animals so he needs to go back to where he's come from,' Dr Millers said.
