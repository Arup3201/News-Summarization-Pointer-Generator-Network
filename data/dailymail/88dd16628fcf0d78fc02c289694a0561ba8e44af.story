A congressman from The Last Frontier is drawing criticism for suggesting  gray wolves could help solve the homeless problem while addressing his colleagues at the Capitol.

Alaska Rep. Don Young made the remark during a House Natural Resources Committee hearing yesterday.

Young, 81, was responding to a letter 79 members of Congress sent to Interior Secretary Sally Jewell asking her to reconsider her agency's 2011 decision to remove the gray wolf from the endangered species list.

Young, a Republican, supported the decision to delist gray wolves and does not want them to reacquire protected status.

During Young's remarks to Jewell, he called the gray wolf a 'predator' that is 'killing the cloven-hoof animals', according to Alaska Public Radio. 

He said: 'We've got 79 Congressmen sending you a letter.

'Haven’t got a damn wolf in their whole district. 

'I’d like to introduce them in your district. 

'I introduce them in your district, you wouldn’t have a homeless problem anymore.'

Hunting wolves is allowed in Alaska.

Young said a healthy wolf population would 'wreak havoc and place anything in their reach in great jeopardy'

After Young's remark generated backlash and requests for clarification, he released a statement.

Young said his comment was an 'analogy' that was 'intended to be hyperbolic in nature' to help highlight that wolves pose a serious problem to communities in his state.

He wrote: 'Anyone who’s dealt with a healthy, roaming wolf population, as we have in Alaska, understands that these predators have a detrimental impact on wildlife populations. 

'If you misunderstood my comments, just imagine the impact a healthy wolf population would have on your own town, community, or congressional district. 

'It would wreak havoc and place anything in their reach in great jeopardy.'

There are an estimated 7,000 to 11,200 gray wolves in Alaska, according to Defenders of Wildlife. 

Alaska had 1,913 homeless residents in 2012 according to a Homelessness Research Institute report.
