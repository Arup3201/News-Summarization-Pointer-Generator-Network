The original signed copy of Margaret Thatcher's telex that ended the Falklands War is expected to fetch £15,000 when it goes under the hammer next month.

The historic dispatch announcing the retaking of the Falklands Islands after the 1982 war with Argentina is signed by Mrs Thatcher and Major General Jeremy Moore - who sent it when victory was secured.

The rare document is also signed by Sir Rex Hunt, the Civil Commissioner on the islands during the conflict, and Major General Sir Julian Thompson, who commanded 3 Commando Brigade.

Value: The unique document is set to fetch £15,000 at auction. It is signed by Mr Thatcher and Major General Jeremy Moore - who sent the dispatch at the end of the war

Auction: The historic telex sent to Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher to confirm the end of the Falkland's War in 1982 is to go under the hammer next month. Mrs Thatcher is pictured in Whitehall in 1992 next to a famous image of British troops during the conflict

Historic: Richard Westwood-Brookes, historic books specialist at Mullocks Auctioneers, stands over the telex which he says is one of the most important British historical documents of the late 20th Century

Names: Another sheet of paper framed alongside the telex was signed by a number of prominent Falkland's servicemen last time the document went up for auction in 1999

It is accompanied by another sheet which was signed 
by other major participants in the war when the telex last went up for auction in 1999.

The signatories included Welsh Guard Simon 
Weston who suffered horrific burn injuries during the conflict. The sheet was then mounted alongside the telex in the same frame.

The telex had been donated on that occasion personally by Mrs Thatcher - who died last month - to raise money for services charities where it was bought by its current owner.

Richard Westwood-Brookes, Historical Documents Expert at Shropshire-based Mullocks Auctioneers, where the documents will go under the hammer next month, said: 'This is undoubtedly one of the most important British historical documents of the last quarter of the 20th century.

'It provides bidders with the opportunity to obtain a document which is truly unique.

'There have been various copies of this document offered in the past but this is the original - and as such ranks along some of the most famous dispatches in British military history, including those from the Battles of Waterloo and Trafalgar.'

Aftermath: Jubilant crowds greet the QE2 as it arrives back in Southampton - filled with servicemen - after the conflict

The document, dated 14 June 1982, reads: 'Major General Menedes surrendered to me all the Argentine armed forces in east and west Falkland, together with their impedimenta.

'Arrangements are in hand to assemble the men for their return to Argentina, to gather in their arms and equipment, and to mark and make safe their munitions. The Falkland Islands are once more under the government desired by their inhabitants. God save the Queen.'

It will be sold at the next Mullock's auction of major historical documents at Ludlow Racecourse on Tuesday May 21st.

Frail: Mrs Thatcher is helped to her door in 2011. The Iron Lady became increasingly frail in her later years

Funeral: A Union flag draped coffin bearing the body of former Mrs Thatcher is carried up the steps of St Paul's Cathedral during her funeral last month

Mrs Thatcher's funeral last month drew tens of thousands onto the streets of London - while St Paul's Cathedral, where the service was held, was packed with dignitaries from her time in office.

These included members of her former cabinets, such as Norman Tebbit and Lord Heseltine, and more recent political heavyweights including the former prime ministers Tony Blair and Gordon Brown.

The Falklands War began in April 1982, when Argentine forces invaded and occupied the Falkland Islands and South Georgia, which are both British dependencies.

The British government quickly sent a naval task force to fight the Argentine Navy and Air Force, and retake the islands. The war ended with Argentina's surrender on 14 June. Nearly 650 Argentine, 255 British military personnel and three Falkland Islanders died.
