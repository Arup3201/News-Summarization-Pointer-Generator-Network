A law-abiding family man was ordered to quit his job after a criminal record check wrongly labelled him a hardened criminal with convictions stretching back a decade.

David Reay was wrongly identified as being guilty of offences including burglary, theft and possession of cocaine when details of a criminal with a similar name were given to his new employers after they asked for a Criminal Records Bureau (CRB) check.

Mr Reay, who lives with his wife 
Stephanie and six-year-old son Robert in South Benwell, Newcastle, had 
just taken up a training post for his new position with the National 
Citizen Service as child and adult welfare helpline advisor, when the 
mistake occurred.

The 33-year-old has now been left in limbo as he cannot return to work while he waits for the verdict of his appeal.

Mistaken identity: David Reay was wrongly labelled a hardened criminal following a mix-up during a CRB check

He said: 'I’d got the job and started my two weeks of training when my wife rang and said "your CRB has arrived and there seems to be a problem with it".

'I immediately told my employers who said they were sorry but I’d have to leave and they’d keep the post open for me while I appealed against the results of the check.

'That was back at the start of September and I’ve been without work or a wage ever since while my appeal to the Disclosure and Barring Service (DBS) was dealt with.

'I was left in limbo despite the criminal record obviously not belonging to me as so many of the details were different. I was angry as it could have so easily been sorted out, but I was told I’d have to wait for at least three weeks before I could even chase up my appeal.'

Authorities asked Northumbria Police for any criminal convictions linked to Mr Reay as part of the enhanced CRB, which is now known as the Disclosure and Barring Service checks.

But the details of a different person from the North East were sent.

Appeal: Mr Reay has been left in limbo as he cannot return to work while he waits for the verdict of his appeal

Criminal convictions including burglary, theft, possession of cocaine and drink driving, spanning over a decade, were all on the record.

Mr Reay said: 'It was ridiculous, I’ve 
never even had a driving licence. We were meant to be taking a trip to 
Cadbury World for my son’s birthday but with no wage had to cancel it.

'I was in limbo not knowing when it would be sorted out.'

Northumbria Police moved to resolve the identity error with Mr Reay, who now hopes to restart his training on November 2.

A force spokesman said: 'We acknowledge that in this case, due to a human error, Mr Reay’s details were incorrectly matched to another individual with similar details and this resulted in information that did not relate to Mr Reay being disclosed on his Enhanced Disclosure Certificate.

'We have spoken to Mr Reay, and unreservedly apologised, and have advised him that his dispute has been returned to DBS and a revised, accurate certificate will be provided to him as quickly as possible.

'We have also reassured him that his employment will not be affected, and with his permission, have spoken to his employer to explain our error. We will keep Mr Reay updated with progress and advised him he can contact us at any time if he has concerns.'

Nick Pickles, director of privacy and civil liberties campaign group Big Brother Watch, said: 'This highlights why the ability of people to check their disclosure before it is sent to employers is so important.

'The process needs to be in place for people to not spend huge amounts of time waiting to them to be corrected, as any delay could do serious harm to their job prospects.'
