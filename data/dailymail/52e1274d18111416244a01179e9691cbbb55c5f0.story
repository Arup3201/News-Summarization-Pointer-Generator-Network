A woman dressed in a bunny girl-style outfit is among four people police want to speak to in connection with an unprovoked assault on a train.

British Transport Police (BTP) have issued CCTV pictures of the blonde and three men they believe have 'key information' about the attack in which a group of 12 friends, heading home after a night out, were targeted.

The victims were heading back to Worcester after going out in Birmingham, and boarded the 6.10am service from the city's Moor Street station, on Saturday November 2.

A blonde woman and three men, one pictured above, are thought to hold 'key information' about the attack

Pc Brendan Gilbride, of BTP, said it was shortly after getting on the train that 'members of the group were subjected to an unprovoked assault by another group who were on the same train'.

He added: 'The train driver managed to split the two groups up and the victims left the train.'

The attackers later got off at Old Hill rail station in Warley in the West Midlands.

The woman in the bunny outfit was accompanied by these two men - who police also wish to speak with

Pc Gilbride added: "Inquiries have been ongoing to trace those responsible and I would now ask members of the public to come forward with information if they know the identity of any of the people in these photographs.

"We believe all four will have key information which can assist the investigation."

BTP can be contacted on 800 405040 or by texting 61016 quoting incident reference WWA/B8 of 13/12/2013.
