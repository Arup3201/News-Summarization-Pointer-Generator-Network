Luo Yuan who oversaw the development of China's first aircraft carrier plane, suffered a heart attack

An engineer who spent years developing the country's first fighter jet for a ship suffered a heart attack just moments after he witnessed the plane make its first successful landing.

State broadcaster CCTV took the unusual step of running news of Luo Yuan's death as its first item on the noon broadcast, a rare honour for a scientist who was previously unknown outside of the aircraft carrier program.

Luo, 51, oversaw the development of the J-15 fighter-bomber planes designated for the ship, which is called Liaoning after the province where it is based.

Chinese academics assigned to signature 
government projects such as this are often under enormous 
pressure, and stress is considered among the biggest killers of the 
country's intellectuals.

Coverage of Luo's death illustrates the priority China has placed on the program, seen as representing the nation's rise from poverty to economic and political might over the past three decades.

The carrier was built in the former Soviet Union and is seen as a test platform for future Chinese-built vessels.

Few details were available about Luo, who died on Sunday.

Shenyang Aircraft Corporation, where Luo worked, confirmed his death but declined to give details.

The company produces the bulk of China's modern military jets - many of them, like the J-15, derived from Russian models.

China overcame major technical hurdles to make the carrier seaworthy after buying the half-completed hulk from the Ukraine and towing it to China, minus its engines, weaponry and navigation systems.

Most of that work was carried out in the northeastern port of Dalian, to which the carrier returned on Sunday following its latest round of sea trials.

Despite the breakthrough in air operations, the ship is still years away from being battle-worthy.

China's navy still needs to show it 
can operate large numbers of planes at the same time and organise a 
carrier battle group that includes submarines and support ships.

'The first landing may be a 
milestone, but it's just the beginning,' said Toshi Yoshihara, professor
of Asia-Pacific studies at the U.S. Naval War College in Rhode Island. 
'How the Chinese will handle aircraft losses, which are inevitable, is a
better indicator of Beijing's determination to become a carrier.'

The People's Liberation Army (PLA) 
Navy landed a J-15 fighter jet - capable of carrying missiles and 
precision-guided bombs - on its Liaoning aircraft carrier while the ship
was out at sea.

The 
carrier, which is China's first, officially entered service two months 
ago, but it is not expected to carry a full complement of planes or be 
ready for combat for some time.

China's state news agency released 
pictures of the fighter touching down on the ship. The carrier is 
regarded as symbolic of the country's bid to become a leading Asian 
naval power.

Xinhua said the landing exercise 
marked the debut outing of the domestically developed J-15, which is 
said to have capabilities to match those of Russia's Sukhoi Su-33 
carrier-based defence fighter, as well as the U.S. F-15 fighter jet.

It is able to carry anti-ship, air-to-air and air-to-ground missiles and precision-guided bombs.

The carrier platform and J-15 capabilities met all requirements and achieved 'good compatibility', the news agency said.

Since China's Liaoning ship formally entered into service on September 25, its crew members have completed over 100 training and test programs.

China spent ten years refurbishing the carrier after buying the unfinished former Soviet navy ship from the Ukraine in 1998.
