American Airlines today moved to reassure passengers that their airmiles and existing bookings were safe, but analysts fear the company's bankruptcy filing may affect future plans.

The stricken company sent a letter to its frequent flyers saying: 'We want to assure you that your AAdvantage miles are secure'.

It also re-asserted its intent to honor existing program awards and promised to honour tickets.

In trouble: American Airlines and American Eagle's parent companies are filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection

It comes as the new CEO admitted there will be tough times ahead, but vowed to turn the company around.

'The path ahead will be tough', Thomas
Horton told NBC's Nightly News program. 'But it's a well-trodden path 
and we will make the company successful.'

Analysts said passengers would not notice little difference in the short term.

'I think everything's cool,' said Tom 
Parsons, head of deals website Bestfares (bestfares.com) and a long-time
observer of the airline industry.

'I have almost 300,000 miles with American, and there's no sweat on my brow.'

But the reorganisation of American 
Airlines and its parent company AMR Corp could lead to a shakeup in 
prices, fewer flights and an altered flying experience, it was warned (see Q&A panel below).

The company yesterday filed for 
Chapter 11 bankruptcy in a desperate push to unload huge debt from years
of rising fuel prices and labour costs.

Reshuffle: The third largest U.S. airline also said its CEO Gerard Arpey, left, will step down and be replaced by Thomas Horton, right - its current president

The third-biggest airline in the U.S. wants to reduce costs and its $30billion debt to stay competitive but insists the restructure will not affect flights.

The move to bankruptcy protection is a crushing blow to an iconic brand and represents an alarming symbol of America’s dying economy.

Jet fuel cost an average of $3 per gallon so far this year - a record according to government data that goes back to 1990. 

Jet fuel is more expensive now than the average of $2.96 per gallon in 2008, when oil rose above $147 per barrel for the first time.

It has risen 56.4 per cent in the past five years. The average price of jet fuel was $1.92 per gallon in 2006.

Parent firm AMR - based in Fort 
Worth, Texas - along with regional affiliate AMR Eagle Holding, are 
filing voluntary bankruptcy petitions to reorganise.

The third largest U.S. airline also 
said its CEO Gerard Arpey will step down and be replaced by Thomas 
Horton - currently the company's president.

American was the only major U.S. 
airline that didn't file for bankruptcy protection after the 9/11 
attacks on New York and Washington D.C.
The last major airline to file for bankruptcy protection was Delta in 2005.

Labour costs are a big headache for American. It remains the only major airline that still must fund worker pensions.

Big business: The company listed assets of about $24.7 billion, liabilities of $29.55 billion and $4.1billion in cash at a court in New York

American says labour-contract rules 
force it to spend at least $600million more than other airlines. It has
also struggled with rising jet fuel costs.

American lost $162million in the third quarter and has lost money in 14 of the last 16 quarters.

The company listed assets of about $24.7 billion, liabilities of $29.55 billion and $4.1billion in cash at a court in New York.

‘We plan to initiate further 
negotiations with all of our unions to reduce our labour costs to 
competitive levels,’ Mr Horton said.

Q: Are my airmiles safe?

For now.

Airlines tend to protect their mileage programs throughout bankruptcy, airline analyst Tom Parsons said, because they make money selling miles to credit card issuers and even passengers trading in miles fill seats and spend money.

But Morningstar airline expert Basili Alukos said that could change.

'My hunch is that, when they come out of bankruptcy, they may make them more difficult to redeem,' he said. 'From what I understand, they can change this whenever they want.'

Q: Will my current reservations be honoured?

Booked flights are secure as American said it would operate its regular schedule and honor tickets and reservations.

But American could reduce its number of flights. That could mean that not all routes would continue indefinitely.

Q: Will prices go up or down?

American may cut prices to keep planes full, particularly in anticipation of a slow January and February, but those are typical sale periods for the airlines.

But the longer-term impact of an airline bankruptcy is higher ticket prices, not lower ones. As American uses this reorganization to get rid of many big, pricey, old planes, it may also cut their routes.

'With fewer planes in the sky and fewer seats, you may be forced to pay more,' said Mr Parsons.

Q: Will flights be safe?

Federal safety inspectors have stepped up their surveillance of American Airlines and American Eagle (also owned by AMR), according to the Federal Aviation Administration.

'The FAA acts swiftly to aggressively protect the safety of the traveling public any time an airline files for bankruptcy protection,' said a spokesperson for the agency.

But there's no reason to believe that the bankruptcy filing of such a large airline would lead to safety problems.

Q: Will the new American be better?

American passengers may notice positive and negative changes in their flights.

As the company gives up its older planes, passengers can expect to see more bells and whistles on the new ones.

Q: What about the workers?

A: With American's 80,000 employees expected to lose some pensions and other benefits, Mr Parsons expects the company's flight attendants to be crankier than usual. 'Those friendly skies will still need some improvement,' he said.

AMR's top rivals, UAL Corp and Delta 
Air Lines, which both used bankruptcy protection to slash costs, have 
since found merger partners.

Delta bought Northwest Airlines and UAL Corp bought Continental Airlines to form United Continental Holdings.

AMR has been in labour talks with its pilots for five years and a wave of retirements in October had prompted speculation it was nearing a bankruptcy filing.

Some analysts believed pilots chose to retire to lock in pension values that may now be in jeopardy as the company moves through bankruptcy court.

Long tradition: American Airlines was formed from a group of companies over a ten-year period and started trading on the stock exchange in 1939

'They will have to go through the whole process that their peers have gone through,' aviation analyst John Strickland told Bloomberg.

Firms use Chapter 11 bankruptcy for gaining time to restructure so they can still stay in operation.

This method allows firms to keep many of their assets as they try to become profitable again rather than going straight into liquidation.

'It’s painful but probably necessary. They have fallen behind what others have done.' AMR shares have fallen almost 80 per cent this year.

For the 240,000 passengers who fly American Airlines each day, the airline's bankruptcy filing should have little noticeable impact.

Delta, United, Continental and US Airways all went through Chapter 11. Their planes still took off and landed and frequent flier miles were still earned and redeemed.

The only risk is if the restructuring fails, the airline liquidates and ceases to fly. But travelers who bought tickets by credit card would be protected.

'Miles are safe,' said Gary Leff, co-founder of frequent flier site MilePoint.

American was founded in 1930 from the 
combination of more than 80 smaller carriers and started trading on the 
stock exchange in 1939.

Half of its fleet flew for the military airline during World War Two - and it introduced the first domestic scheduled American freight service in 1944.

In 1953 it was the first airline to provide a nonstop trans-continental service. Its holding company AMR was formed after a reorganisation in 1982.

American is now the nation's third-largest airline behind United Continental Holdings and Delta Air Lines.

It flies about 240,000 passengers per day, has around 78,000 employees and operates out of five major hubs in New York, Los Angeles, Dallas-Fort Worth, Chicago and Miami.

But AMR has suffered losses of $162million in the third quarter and $2.7billion in the past year.
