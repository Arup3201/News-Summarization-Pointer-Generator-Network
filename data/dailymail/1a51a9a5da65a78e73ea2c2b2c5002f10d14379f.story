An extremist Muslim who has claimed Jews are descended from 'apes and pigs', called gays 'criminals' and has made controversial comments about domestic violence has given a talk at a London university.

Haitham al-Haddad spoke to students on Islamic finance at the School of Oriental and African Studies at the University of London.

He has outraged moderate Muslims who are critical of him for teaching young Muslims that men and women should be segregated.

Dr Al-Haddad advocated that gays should be outlawed and has also praised terror boss Osama bin Laden. He has also spoken out in favour of female genital mutilation.

He has claimed Jewish people are descended from 'apes and pigs' and says people who leave Islam should be executed, although he has claimed in the past his comments have been misinterpreted.

Usama Hasan, of the moderate, anti- terrorism think tank, the Quilliam Foundation, said: ‘Like all extreme Islamists, he uses fascist language about non-Muslims and refuses to sit at the same table as women.’

Student Rights, in an article on their website, added that invitations to Dr al-Haddad to appear on campus are not actually unusual

Raheem Kassam, director of Student Rights which campaigns against extremism on campuses, told the Evening Standard: 'He is the epitome of illiberal views that should have no place on university campuses.

'It is not like there is a lack of serious professional decent Islamic scholars in Britain.'

Student Rights, in an article on their
 website, added that invitations to Dr al-Haddad to appear on campus are
 not actually unusual.

He 
has been invited to address students at Aston University in Birmingham 
today on the topic of Sharia law and last week, the Islamic Society at 
the University of Westminster announced that he would be speaking on 
Islam and law less than six hours before the event was due to take 
place.

A spokesman for SOAS student union said the event was 'stewarded' to ensure the discussion remained 'on topic'.

Elis Gjevori, who said he was a principal organiser of the event, wrote: 'What the speakers believe or don’t believe do not necessarily reflect the views of the society, rather what we are providing is a platform for experts in the field of Islamic economics to come and speak at SOAS.'

Radio Netherlands reported that in February 2012, Dutch authorities tried to prevent Dr al-Haddad speaking at a university in Amsterdam. The university subsequently cancelled the event. Heblamed a 'Zionist lobby' for the opposition to the talk.

This week it emerged that the radical 
Muslim cleric has hired out Legoland for a ‘Family Fun Day'. On March 9,
 a convoy of coaches will set off from the East London Mosque in 
Whitechapel for a day of ‘Halal entertainment’.
