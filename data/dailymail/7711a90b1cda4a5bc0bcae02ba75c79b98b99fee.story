Katherine Kerswell is now earning £142,000 to 'reform' the civil service after a £420,000 pay-off from Kent County Council

A former council chief who was given a
£420,000 pay-off last year has now been appointed by the Coalition to 
‘reform’ the civil service - on a salary of £142,000.

Katherine Kerswell caused anger when 
she walked away with the massive pay-off after just 20 months as head of
Kent County Council.

Conservative Party chairman Grant Shapps condemned the pay-off as ‘deeply concerning’ when details finally emerged in June.

Mr Shapps, who was a local government 
minister at the time, said: ‘I find dipping into the public purse to 
make such an eye-watering pay-off unacceptable’.

But last night it was announced that 
Mrs Kerswell, 49, has been made the Cabinet Office’s director-general 
for civil service reform on a salary of £142,000 a year – just £500 less
than the Prime Minister.

Cabinet Office Minister Francis Maude 
defended the appointment, saying Mrs Kerswell ‘brings experience and 
expertise to this crucial role’.

Sir Bob Kerslake, head of the civil 
service, said he was ‘delighted’ with the appointment, describing Mrs 
Kerswell as ‘an accomplished leader with a track record of successful 
change management in the wider public sector’.

But critics said the appointment 
raised questions about the Government’s commitment to tackle the scandal
of council bosses and quangocrats who get huge pay-offs only to walk 
into lucrative new jobs in the public sector months later.

Matthew Sinclair, chief executive of the TaxPayers’ Alliance, said members of the public were likely to view the appointment with deep suspicion. He said: ‘Katherine Kerswell is the poster girl for senior public sector staff riding the job merry-go-round.

'Despite pocketing vast sums of taxpayers’ money simply for leaving her role at Kent County Council, she has landed yet another role at our expense.

‘Given that Kerswell is in charge of 
civil service reform, her first task should be to end the culture of 
excessive golden goodbyes with which she is all too familiar.’

Mrs Kerswell, who said she was ‘thrilled’ with her new job, has held a string of top council posts, most recently as the £197,000-a-year ‘managing director’ of Kent County Council.

She left in December after axing 1,000 jobs at a cost of almost £11million. The council’s accounts revealed she had received a final year package of £589,165, including a £420,000 pay-off, £139,806 in salary and a £29,359 pension contribution.

She sparked fury in her previous job as chief executive of Northamptonshire County Council by arguing that her £197,136 salary was good value as it represented only 29p for each person in the county.

She also faced mockery at the time for her love of management speak, which included a ‘Taste the Strawberry’ campaign that encouraged staff to focus on the overall ‘flavour’ of council services.

In opposition, the Tories pledged to clamp down on huge public sector payouts. But despite modest reforms, the pattern has continued. Earlier this month it emerged that 450 council chiefs were handed six-figure pay-offs in the last year, with Mrs Kerswell receiving the biggest package of all.

An investigation by the Daily Mail revealed that dozens of bosses at regional development agencies also received six-figure pay-offs when the quangos were wound up this year. In many cases those involved landed lucrative jobs in the state sector just days later.

Mrs Kerswell will now lead a project designed to ‘reform’ the civil service. Mr Maude said he wanted a civil service that was ‘flatter, faster, more digital, more unified, with better capabilities and performance management, focused on outcomes not process, with modern terms and conditions’.
