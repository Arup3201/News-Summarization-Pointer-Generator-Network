When this devastated dog owner left her tiny teacup Chihuahua paralysed after accidentally rolling on top of it in bed, she feared her beloved family pet would never recover.

The dog, named Mary, was rendered immobile after a bone in its neck snapped, and vets told owner Lisa Havelock that the pint-sized pooch would have to be put down.

But the Chihuahua has now been dubbed 'Miracle Mary' after making a remarkable recovery - and devout Christian Ms Havelock has said it is all thanks to the power of prayer.

The miracle of Mary: Lisa Havelock feared her tiny teacup Chihuahua would not recover after she accidentally rolled on it in bed, rendering the dog immobile

Injury: Devout Ms Havelock said Mary, whose neck injury is visible in this X-ray, made a miraculous recovery after she and her friends prayed that she would get better

Ms Havelock had brought Mary home as a pet for her children Willow, 15, and Oakley, but said the whole family had fallen in love with the 'diamond' dog.

She accidentally crushed the pet when she rolled over onto it at her home in Barmouth, Gwynned, in north west Wales.

After rushing Mary to the local vet, Ms Havelock was told it was unlikely the dog would pull through and that it would have to be put down.

Horrified at the prospect of losing Mary, devout Ms Havelock gathered 15 others to pray for her dog's recovery at her local Elim Pentecostal Church.

Incredibly, Mary rallied around, and Ms Havelock firmly believes she got the miracle she prayed for.

'When we took her to the vets they thought she would have to be put down,' she said.

'The vets told us that her quality of life would be no good.

'We were absolutely devastated, and I felt awful because it was me who had done this to her. 

'We got Mary for our children Oakley, who’s seven, and Willow who’s 15, but we all fell in love with her because she’s such a diamond.'

Ms Havelock, who said the whole 
family cried as she told her children that Mary might not pull through, 
turned to prayer the following day.

'The next day around 15 of us got together and went to Elim Pentecostal church and we prayed for a miracle for Mary,' she said.

Now, following surgery and two weeks of intensive veterinary care, the Chihuahua is back at home with the Havelocks.

The dog's owner added that the day before Mary 
came home, vets at Tudor Lawson Dallimore and Parry vets in Dolgellau, 
Gwynedd, north-west Wales, had said that she would only have 30 per cent 
quality of life. 

'She needed to be able to have 85 per cent quality of life before she could come home,' Ms Havelock said.

'We were dreading the phone call to say that we would have to have her put down and when the phone rang I just felt sick. 

'But the vets told us that Mary was better and she would be allowed home, it was just amazing, it has got to be a miracle. 

'We do believe in the power of prayer, that little dog was not supposed to live but she did.

'We’ve now called her Miracle Mary,' Ms Havelock said of her cherished pet, who spent six weeks wearing a tiny neck brace after returning home to Gwynedd.

On the mend: Mary, seen with her owner and vet Alice Hewitt, is now walking around again following two and a half weeks of intensive veterinary care

A spokesperson for the vet in Gwynedd said: 'Mary’s neck injury was very severe and she had lost the use of all of her legs. 

'We weren’t sure if she was going to pull through when she first arrived at the surgery.

'After two and a half weeks of intensive veterinary care from our team and complete immobilisation of her head and neck, Mary was showing signs of improvement and was beginning to move her legs on her own. 

'Therefore we decided that she was progressing well enough for her to continue her recovery at home with the care of her dedicated owners.'

The tiny dog now has something of a fan club at the veterinary surgery.

'Mary is such a huge character despite her tiny size,' the spokesman said.

'We are all thrilled with the extent of her recovery and are confident she will only get stronger as time goes on.'
