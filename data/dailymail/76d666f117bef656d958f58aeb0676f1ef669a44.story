Mac attack: Crystal Brooks ran over boyfriend Santiago Hernandez with his own truck because he didn't want to go to McDonald's

A Tennessee woman ran over her boyfriend multiple times with his own truck Friday after he refused to stop at McDonald’s.

Crystal Brooks, 33, went into a rage after boyfriend Santiago Hernandez, 41, declined to go to the fast food chain. 

The couple, who live together in Kingsport, have a child and live together, according to a police report posted to The Smoking Gun.

After Mr Hernandez went against Ms Brooks’ wishes, she demanded he pull over.

He then got out of the Chevrolet S-10 and she replaced him in the driver’s seat.

Ms Brooks then hit the gas – with her baby’s father standing in front of the pickup – causing him to go flying onto the hood, then the ground.

‘She then pulled forward and struck him two more times with the truck,’ the report said.

The arresting officer ‘observed his clothing appeared torn, consistent with being dragged on the pavement.’

Mr Santiago also had multiple abrasions on his skin, said the officer.

Despite the hungry woman insisting her boyfriend jumped on the hood of the truck, cops booked her for aggravated assault.

Mr Brooks is currently sitting in Sullivan County (TN) Jail on a $15,000 bond, a jail official told MailOnline.
