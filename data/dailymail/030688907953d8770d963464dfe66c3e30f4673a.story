A man apparently sneaked past police officers at the scene of his brother's suicide and killed himself at the same spot.

Police in Houston, Texas, found a man dead from a self-inflicted gunshot wound at a mobile home park on Wednesday night.

While they were still at the scene of the suicide, the man's brother got past them into a mobile home - where he took a gun and also shot himself dead.

Double tragedy: A man sneaked past police to kill himself at the same spot as his brother in Houston, Texas

Nathan Rosenblatt of the Houston Police Department told KHOU 11 News: 'The brother came to the scene, slipped by officers unnoticed in the 
crowd, proceeded to his room and then grabbed a gun of his own and committed 
suicide.'

Police told the local news channel they heard the shots a few moments after seeing the man in the mobile home.

The double incident has raised questions over how police contain crime scenes.

Police and the Houston Fire Department had not yet had the chance to set up a cordon when the second man killed himself, the Houston Chronicle reported.

Houston Police Department spokesman Victor Senties told the paper that contrary to other reports, police were not yet sure whether the man had sneaked past them or if he was in the mobile home the whole time.

Mr Senties also declined to confirm whether the men were related.

The double shooting happened at Joe's Mobile Home Park in the south east of the city.

It is thought the first victim had argued with his girlfriend and shot himself in the head in the car park outside.

In the wake of the tragedy, police are said to be re-evaluating their protocol on how they deal with active crime scenes.

The men have not yet been identified officially.
