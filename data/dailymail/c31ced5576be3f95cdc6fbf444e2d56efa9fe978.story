The BBC was forced into an embarrassing apology last night after broadcasting footage of Jimmy Savile leering over a young woman on Top Of The Pops, and apparently brushing her top.

The astonishing gaffe went out on BBC2 on Saturday September 13 at 10.45pm when viewers tuned in to watch Top Of The Pops Two, a compilation programme of vintage hits from the 1970s and 80s.

In the footage originally filmed in 1971, Savile – now known as Britain’s most notorious paedophile – is seen among a crowd of music fans who are dancing during a performance by The Mixtures.

'Insulting': The footage from 1971 shows Jimmy Savile on Top Of The Pops, as he appears to brush his hand over an unknown girl's top

Seemingly unaware that he is being filmed, he is shown speaking intently to the young woman and appears to brush her top as he wags his finger.

The woman’s identity is unknown, but the BBC received complaints from viewers and the images were later removed from a repeat of the show available on the BBC’s iPlayer service, with a note saying the content had been edited.

Last night, one of Savile’s victims reacted to the blunder with anger and dismay.

Deborah Cogger, 54, who was sexually abused by Savile when she was just 14, told The Mail on Sunday: ‘When are they going to learn? They’ve got no regard for anybody except themselves. Doesn’t anyone vet these programmes before they come out?

‘It’s just not good enough. I want to know who’s in charge. Somebody must know what content is in the programme before it hits the screen. It just takes my breath away. These people have a total disregard for people’s feelings.’

She added: ‘I’m utterly shocked and disgusted. This is an insult not only to Savile’s victims, but also the general public. I think they should destroy all footage they’ve got of him. Why anyone would want to keep it for posterity, I’ve no idea. The BBC is throwing mud at us, disregarding everything we’ve done and how far we’ve come in our fight.’

Edited: The online iPlayer message

Liz Dux, an abuse lawyer at Slater and Gordon, which is representing 174 of Savile’s victims, added: ‘You can’t underestimate the amount of distress Savile’s victims will have suffered if they have seen this.

'It is a constant reminder of what they have been through. Many of them still await the findings of the BBC inquiry and a resolution to questions that have been ongoing for nearly two years. Seeing something like this reawakens their suffering.’

And MP Rob Wilson said: ‘Having failed to deal with a series of paedophile BBC stars, it’s astonishing it could put Jimmy Savile on air again apparently touching a young woman. This will be very hurtful to his many victims and is particularly inept of the Corporation.’

When contacted by The Mail on Sunday, the Corporation apologised ‘for any distress caused’. The BBC confirmed it had received seven complaints about the footage, but this is not the first time it has allowed offensive footage of Savile to slip through editing.

Last year, it was forced to apologise after airing an impersonation of Savile on children’s TV channel, CBeebies. The BBC received more than 200 complaints after showing a 2001 episode of the Tweenies featuring a character sporting a blond wig and a gold necklace, who did a convincing impression of the disgraced star’s Yorkshire accent.

Savile is now known to have abused hundreds of young victims over six decades. But the former Top Of The Pops presenter, who received a knighthood in 1990, died aged 84 in October 2011 – a year before the allegations emerged in an ITV documentary after the BBC shelved a Newsnight investigation into the star.

The Corporation’s failure to run the Newsnight story led to the £2.4million Pollard Review.

A judge-led inquiry looking into sexual abuse at the BBC is due to report at the end of the year and the scandal prompted the Metropolitan Police to set up Operation Yewtree, which has encouraged hundreds of victims to come forward and report abuse by Savile and other celebrities.

Last night a BBC spokesman said: ‘We have reviewed references to Jimmy Savile across archive footage, including a number which were brought to our attention. Where the material is likely to cause offence to his victims it is removed. Although all programmes are reviewed before broadcast, unfortunately this brief appearance was missed. It was removed from iPlayer as soon as we were made aware and replaced with a re-edited version. We apologise  for any distress caused.’
