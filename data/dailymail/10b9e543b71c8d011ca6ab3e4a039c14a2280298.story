The Archbishop of York has ordered an independent inquiry into claims against a former cathedral dean.

Dr John Sentamu said the Church of England treats child abuse allegations 'with the utmost seriousness'.

His statement comes after his predecessor, Lord Hope of Thornes, denied suggestions he covered up allegations against Robert Waddington, a former Dean of Manchester Cathedral, who died from cancer five years ago.

Lord Hope, who was Archbishop of York between 1995 and 2005, was twice informed about allegations against Mr Waddington, who is said to have abused chorister Eli Ward in Manchester in the 1980s and a school boy in Australia.

Inquiry: Archbishop of York Dr John Sentamu has ordered an independent investigation into claims against Robert Waddington

Eli Ward said he was first singled out
by the Dean of Manchester, the Very Reverend Robert Waddington, at the 
age of 11 and was then a close companion of his over a five-year period.

The
allegations made in public by Mr Ward for the first time this week led 
to suggestions of a cover-up over the Church’s response following 
complaints to bishops in 2003.

But the former Archbishop of York, 
Lord Hope of Thornes, who at the time oversaw the Manchester diocese, 
said he did not tell police and social services because Church rules 
then did not require it and because the Dean was dying of cancer.

Mr Ward, now 40, said he was sleeping 
in the Dean’s bed by the time he was 13 and by his mid-teens was 
spending almost every weekend and many nights at the cleric’s house. He 
went with him on holidays to Cornwall, the Lake District, Paris and the 
South of France.

The abuse started when Mr Waddington 
began the grooming process in 1984 and ended after suspicions were 
raised in the Manchester diocese in 1989, Mr Ward told the Times 
newspaper. In 2004, Dean Waddington, who had by then retired, was 
stripped of his right to lead Church services by Lord Hope but no 
information was passed on to police or social services. The Dean died in
2007.

Scandal: Former Archbishop of York Lord Hope, 
left, was told of child sex abuse allegations against Dean of Manchester
Robert Waddington, right, but did not report them to the police

Yesterday Lord Hope said in a statement: 'Throughout my time as bishop and archbishop I always adhered to the statutory practices of the Church of England concerning safeguarding.

'I strenuously deny (and am obviously disappointed at) the suggestion that myself or my team at the time would have acted negligently in this or any other safeguarding matter.'

He said the Church of England's 1999 Policy on Child Protection, which was in effect at the time but which has subsequently been reviewed, stated that there is no automatic legal obligation on the Church to refer allegations by adults to the police or social services.

But he said the policy stated it was essential to consider whether children may still be at risk from the alleged abuser and, if so, report the matter to the police or social services.

He said: 'In considering whether children would be at risk from Robert Waddington I decided under these guidelines that this would not be the case given his serious ill health following cancer surgery. The following year I revoked Robert Waddington's permission to officiate. He died two years later.'

And Lord Hope added: 'I am deeply aware of the pain caused to any victim of child abuse, especially at the hands of a trustworthy person within the church. I do encourage any person who believes they have been a victim of abuse to come forward and to inform the police.'

Dr Sentamu's office issued a statement today which said: 'The Archbishop of York is in the process of setting up an Independent Inquiry specifically into the issues surrounding the reports relating to alleged child abuse by the late Robert Waddington.

'When any church related abuse comes to light the Church's first concern must be for the victim offering support and apologising for the abuse, acknowledging that the effects can be lifelong.

'When the Inquiry makes its report the Archbishop will make its findings public.

'The Church of England continues to review its Child Protection and Safeguarding policies regularly to ensure that the Church is a safe place for all.

'Child abuse is a heinous and personally damaging crime, it is therefore incumbent on the Church to treat such matters with the utmost seriousness.'

Mr Ward’s lawyers have now made a personal injury compensation claim against the Dean and Chapter of Manchester.

He said that until last year he 
thought he could deal with the memories but then he felt ‘there’s 
something drastically wrong with me and I then started to scream very 
loudly that I needed help.’

Mr Ward said he came from a poor background in Salford and joined the cathedral choir in Manchester at the age of seven.

Four years later Dean Waddington, a 
former headmaster and then the most senior education official working 
for the Church’s parliament, the General Synod, arrived in the city.

He 
said the Dean showed him special favour, helping him with his homework, 
picking him up in his car to take him to choir practice, asking him out 
to tea and taking him for days out. He asked Mr Ward’s mother if the boy
could stay with him overnight.

The room in which the boy slept had a 
large poster of a horrifying painting by 16th century artist Hieronymus 
Bosch, which gave him nightmares.

Mr Ward said: ‘He turned round to me 
one day and said, “Would you rather stay in my room? Is that painting 
too scary for you?” and of course I said yes.’

Mr Ward began sleeping in the Dean’s bed, where eventually hugs became kissing.

He said that sexual contact began 
after he was distressed over a break-up with a girlfriend. He said he 
felt obliged to perform sexual acts when the Dean asked: ‘Do you love me
this much?’

Mr Ward told the Times he had now 
broken off contact with his own family.

He said: ‘I have no relationship
with my family now because I asked severe, strong questions of my 
family: why did you let it happen? I was the boyfriend of a monster – so
what does that make me?’

Mr Ward said that he was told by the Dean that if questioned by the Press he should lie about what was going on.

After a senior cathedral official did 
begin to inquire about the relationship, the Dean told Mr Ward to quit 
the choir in 1989 and he did so.

He last saw the Dean on his wedding 
day, when the Dean conducted the ceremony. Mr Ward later told his wife 
about the abuse. ‘As soon as I told her, our relationship split like an 
axe,’ he added.

The Right Reverend Paul Butler, the 
head of the Churches National Safeguarding Committee, said: ‘As a Church
we will always apologise for past systems that let down the vulnerable 
and offer support to anyone whose life has been affected. Today we have 
robust safeguarding policies in place.’
