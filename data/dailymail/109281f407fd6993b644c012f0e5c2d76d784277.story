A scorned ex-boyfriend sent a birthday card laced with ricin to his former girlfriend's current boyfriend, according to police.

Nicholas Helman, 19, of Hatboro, Pennsylvania, was arrested Wednesday on an attempted murder charge and other counts after testing confirmed the deadly poison was inside an envelope he reportedly stuffed in his target's mailbox.

His plot was foiled after he bragged to a Target co-worker earlier this month that he sent a poison-laced scratch-and-sniff card to his ex-girlfriend's current boyfriend and that the man would die if he opened it, sources told WCAU.

The co-worker notified police, who called the recipient's home and spoke to his mother, who said her daughter was outside getting the mail at that moment.

Authorities then went to the home to confiscate the card. Footage from the scene showed several officers in hazmat suits as a precaution.

Helman told investigators during initial questioning March 7 that he had coated the card with a substance that resembled anthrax, authorities said in an affidavit of probable cause.

The deluded man told investigators he intended to scare his ex-girlfriend in hopes of reconciling with her, police said. He also sent threatening messages to the pair last November as well, police told WCAU.

A longtime friend of Helman's was shocked by the accusations

Arrested: Helman was first arrested and charged with harassment

'I really couldn't imagine him doing something like that,' the man told WCAU. 'I've known him since Middle School.

'He was an odd kid, the friend continued. 'I would say he wasn't always the most social kid. He was very tech savvy. He was probably the smartest kid I've ever known but he never really applied himself.'

The deranged man was initially was charged with terroristic threats and harassment and spent four days behind bars before making bail.

Authorities said Helman had ingredients for making ricin, a poison that occurs naturally in castor beans, but that initial tests didn't turn up the toxin itself.

The card was then sent away for more lab tests that revealed traces of ricin, the district attorney's office said.

'Lab results on the white powder that was found in the correspondence did prove to test positive for the toxin of ricin,' an official told WPVI.

Toxic standoff: Officers showed up to Helman's home in hazmat gear after tests showed the letter contained ricin, he was arrested only after an hours-long standoff, authorities said

Police accompanied by hazardous materials teams and the FBI then arrested Helman a second time after a multi-hour standoff to add attempted murder and other related charges to his rap sheet.

A neighbor of Helman's was upset over the poison being in the same neighborhood as his children.

'That's really disturbing,' Fred Zimmerman told WPVI. 'I have a 9-year-old, and the kids outside play and ride bikes around here. To hear something like that going on so close is really troubling.'

Bucks County District Attorney David Heckler told The Philadelphia Inquirer that the toxin was 'very potent.'

'He made ricin, and if you lick that card, you're dead,' he said.

Court documents don't list an attorney for Helman, who was jailed without bail after his arraignment Wednesday night. He has a March 27 preliminary hearing.

His father, Douglas, told The (Doylestown) Intelligencer that he knew nothing about the charges. He said his son had been good at science and math in school and made Eagle Scout last year.
