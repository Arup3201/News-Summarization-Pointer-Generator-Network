A former Hare Krishna devotee who spent ten years in a temple learning to be celibate is facing jail for committing a series of sex attacks.

Sean Keen, 50, was a member of the International Society For Krishna Consciousness and forbidden from drinking alcohol or having sex.

The worshipper spent a decade practicing the religion at a temple in Canterbury, Kent, and swore to remain celibate.

Canterbury Crown Court heard Keen carried out a series of sex acts, gave a child a 'love bite' and raped a woman repeatedly

But a court heard Keen was actually a violent bully who would get drunk and force himself onto women.

A jury at Canterbury Crown Court heard he carried out a series of sex acts involving dogs, gave a child a 'love bite' and raped a woman repeatedly.

One of his victims claimed he had used her 'like his toy' and treated her 'as if she were a prostitute for his pleasure'.

The jury also heard how he ripped off another victim's underwear and raped her - despite claiming he was 'a Hare Krishna devotee who was going to be celibate'.

Christopher May, prosecuting, also said on one occasion Keen made a dog carry out a sex act.

In another rape, the victim told police Keen grabbed her around the neck and pushed her against a toilet door.

'He was really angry and he had her by the throat,' Mr May said. 'She kept saying 'No'.

'She struggled with him and they ended up on the floor. He really scared her and said he could snap her neck like a twig.'

His victim revealed that during a violent assault, 'He looked so evil... as if he was somebody else.'

When Keen was quizzed by police, he admitted being an alcoholic and drinking five cans of strong lager every day. 

He told officers he wished he had 'followed his faith to a 'T'.'

The Krishna religion - known officially as International Society For Krishna Consciousness - forbids sex unless it is to create children and bans drinking alcohol. 

He denied three sex attacks and four cruelty charges but was convicted by a jury on Friday.

Now Judge Adele Williams has told Keen, from Canterbury, to expect a custodial sentence for his sexual assaults.

She said: 'You have been convicted on clear and compelling evidence of grave offences.

'But before I determine what your sentence will be, I need a report. You need to know that you face nothing but a lengthy prison sentence.' 

The bully has now been remanded in custody while probation reports are prepared before his sentencing next month.

Following the conviction a spokesperson for the International Society of Krishna Consciousness (ISKCON) said:  'The individual in question has no current affiliation, position or association with the International Society of Krishna Consciousness (ISKCON). He has not had any contact with the organisation for over ten years.

'His actions are abhorrent and criminal and we do not condone them in any way. They are not only a gross violation of our morals, values and code of conduct, but are morally reprehensible for any member of society.

'We have every confidence in the judicial system and believe his sentence should reflect the gravity of his crimes. Our thoughts and prayers are with the victims and their families.'
