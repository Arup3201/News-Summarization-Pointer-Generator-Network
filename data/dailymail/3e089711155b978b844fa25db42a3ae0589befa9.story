Most people will admit they have a dark side, but in the home of Star Wars super-fan Bill McBride, that side of the force is stronger than most.

Sci-fi fan Bill McBride, 42, boasts the world's largest collection of Darth Vader memorabilia and is on a 20-year mission to turn his bedroom into a museum dedicated to the Sith Lord.

Mr McBride, who has spent more than $284,000 on buying Darth Vader merchandise, has spent most of his adult lifeamassing a collection of more than 60,000 items including figurines, artwork and replica lightsabers.

Among the 60,000 pieces in his collection are these highly collectible Darth Vader figures, pictured

He has loved George Lucas' sci-fi movie series since he was five-years-old, but only began collecting Vader keepsakes in the 1980s.

The Star Wars obsessive has dedicated an entire room in his Washington DC home to store his massive collection. 

'The moment Darth Vader burst on screen in Star Wars, I was immediately a fan of the character,' he said.

'But when you have the imposing, powerful presence of David Prowse, the other-worldly voice of James Earl Jones, all wrapped up in one of the coolest, most amazing costumes in movie history, you can't help but fall in love.'

Mr McBride said he once turned down the offer of a Porsche 911 from a man who wanted part of his collection

Darth Vader was played in the original movie by British actor David Prowse, who was better known on UK TV screens as the Green Cross Code Man.

He taught a generation of school children the correct method of crossing the road. 

Unfortunately for the actor, George Lucas did not like his broad regional accent and instead hired American actor James Earl Jones to voice the character. 

The classically trained stage actor had the perfect deep and menacing voice for Darth Vader. 

The hoarder, whose Darth collection contains everything from original movie props, pre-production items, original works of art and modern merchandise, said a 'market value' doesn't exist for some of his rarer items.

And although some of his items could fetch for up to $16,500, he's reluctant to part ways with his cherished Vader relics.

He said: 'I just had someone make one of the more interesting trade offers I've received over the years.

'A gentleman contacted me about trading for a select group of five or five items from my collection.

'Astonishingly, he offered the keys to his Porsche 911, but I turned him down, of course.'

Despite his best efforts, Mr McBride says the collection will never be complete as he looks forward to the new saga in the Star Wars franchise, Episode 7.

'The hobby of Star Wars collecting is mind bogglingly vast, and it's easy to get lost.

'But if anything has changed over the decades, I am more passionate today than when I started.

'Needless to say, the entire world is now becoming fully engaged in Star Wars mania again and I for one am dying to head back into that galaxy, far far away.'  

Some individual items in Mr McBride's collection are worth up to $16,500 to the right collector
