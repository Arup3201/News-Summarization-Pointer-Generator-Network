Top Gear presenter Jeremy Clarkson has named and shamed bad drivers on the social networking site Twitter.

The Top Gear host has published details and even number-plates of motorists who irritate him - highlighting their faults and offering them his words of wisdom.

Mr Clarkson, 52, the BBC's highest paid star, said he got instant satisfaction from tearing into dodgy drivers on Twitter, telling Top Gear magazine how he 'outed' a man in an Audi TT who had been tailgating him.

Jeremy Clarkson, pictured left on Top Gear, took to Twitter to vent his anger about bad drivers to avoid libel

The TV host admitted that libel laws prevented him from lashing out in his magazine column, whereas 'it's a libel free world out there in the electronosphere'.

Mr Clarkson shamed a driver by tweeting: 'Whoever was driving up the M40 30 mins ago in an Audi TT - reg O*** *** - is either an extremely terrible driver or stupid.'

A few days later he then tweeted: 'Silver Lexus P*** *B on the A3 this morning. Drop back from the car in front and you won't have to brake every three seconds.'

Naming and shaming: Clarkson told Top Gear magazine how he 'outed' a man in an Audi TT

Words of wisdom from the Top Gear host on Twitter

Mr Clarkson said in the magazine, as reported by the Daily Star: 'What are the options when you are 
tailgated by a moron?

'You can brake-test him TARGET: Audi TT but this 
will result in many forms and an eventual refusal for the release of 
funds.'

He then gave another list of options then added: 'You want to humiliate the bastard.'

It was the driver of an Audi TT, pictured, that Clarkson said was either a 'terrible driver' or 'stupid'

He advised a driver of a silver Lexus to drop back from the car in front

'But short of following him back to his home and vandalising his garden furniture, this isn't possible. Until now.'

Clarkson
added: 'At present Twitter is used mostly for people to tell 12 other 
people that they've just had a burger. Occasionally it is used by 
footballers to demonstrate they can't spell. It has no actual use. Now, 
though, it could be used to name and shame morons in Audis.

He then added: 'It's a libel free world out there in the electronosphere.'

The BBC said it was not for them to comment on Mr Clarkson's actions on Twitter.
