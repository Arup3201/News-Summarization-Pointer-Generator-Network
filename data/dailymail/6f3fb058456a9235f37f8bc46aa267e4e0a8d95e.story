Instead of dinner and drinks, your next first date could be tokes and munchies.

With niche dating sites targeting everyone from farmers to singles with food allergies, smokers have carved out their own dating portals aimed at pot smokers and medicinal marijuana users.

Those looking for a special someone to pass to the left to visit 420singles.net. The 28-year-old founder from California told the Marin Independent Journal he created the site to find his ideal partner.

Smoking: 420singles.net lets users find singles anywhere in the world that share their passion for pot, and boasts over 22,000 users

'I smoked marijuana, and I was single,' said Ryan Moxon, 'and I was like, I really want to find a girl who also smokes marijuana, and one thing led to another.'

In recent years, 420singles.net saw membership grow thanks to state efforts to legalize weed.

'It’s suddenly much cooler to come out as a toker,' he added. 

But just because pot sales are now legal in Colorado and Washington and the use of medical marijuana allowed in 23 states and Washington, D.C., doesn't mean finding love is easy. 

Michigan auto worker and Vietnam vet Lawrence Ward, 59, smokes to counter the side effects of chemotherapy, and got a second date with a woman nearby with similar medical needs. 

'It's not hard finding a partner who smokes,' Ward said. 'But what I was looking for was somebody with a similar situation as I had going on with the medical marijuana and being licensed.' 

Though the 22,000 users are scattered throughout the U.S., Moxon said that 420singles.net has found investors for an expansion in Colorado.

Mobile: Pot-friendly singles can use iOS and Android apps for my420mate. 420singles.net so far only has a supported app for Android.

'I shouted out on Twitter. I said I was seeking a $10,000 investment to kick me off and they responded,' Moxon said. 'We're going to do a large-scale, targeted ad campaign in Colorado.'

Another site competing for the title of the 'Cupid of cannabis' is my420mate.com, which boasts both iOS and Android mobile apps, but has still struggled breaking into the mainstream dating scene.

420 is a reference to April 20, an important date in cannabis culture.  

The Daily Caller reported that Comcast's Denver offices refused to air a commercial for the company, telling cofounder Jay Lindberg that it wouldn't run ads for the marijuana industry.

'We’re not taking any biz from the new industry,' said Ariana Dobson, a national account executive with Comcast.

And while these sites continue to help chill singles find their match online, Moxon has his own decidedly less chill story of trying to find love.

'She met someone else on my site that went to her college and they started dating.'
