Burberry has been forced to appeal against a decision made by the Chinese authorities to cancel the trademark protection for their iconic tartan print.

The trademark office in China has pulled the legal protection for the famed camel, red and black tartan design on Burberry's leather goods.

The trademark, 
which would have run until 2020, was cancelled because Burberry hasn't 
used that specific checked pattern in China for three years, report the
 Guardian.

The change will not, however, come into effect until after the appeal is heard, according to the company.

If the decision was made official, rival fashion houses could use Burberry's signature pattern on their designs in China.

'The Burberry check remains a 
registered trademark exclusively owned by Burberry and no other parties 
can use the mark without Burberry's proper authorisation,' the company 
said.

'Burberry always takes the strongest possible action against those
 who use its trademarks unlawfullyâ€¦We are confident that our appeal 
will be successful.'

The pattern has become so iconic over the years that Scotland now consider it a 'corporate tartan', says the country's tartan register.

Burberry sales topped Â£1billion in the
 past six months as the luxury clothing and goods business continued to 
draw in customers around the world.

The
 achievement was hailed by boss Angela Ahrendts, who announced plans 
last month to step down by mid-2014 to take up a new position with 
Apple.

Burberry shares are 
down about six per cent since the news Ahrendts will be succeeded by 
Christopher Bailey, who will also retain his chief creative officer 
role, with some investors arguing the two jobs would not sit easily 
together.
