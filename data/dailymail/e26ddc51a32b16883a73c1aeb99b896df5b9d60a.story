Drug-driving motorists will be named and shamed on Twitter if they fail police ‘walk the line’ tests.

Suspects are often asked to prove they are fit to be behind the wheel by carrying out tasks such as negotiating a straight line on foot or standing on one leg.

Those who cannot do so and are later convicted can then expect to be publicly named and shamed online.

The video or picture evidence of drivers could be posted on the internet within days of the offence.

Courts are setting aside extra time to try to convict defendants within ten days of being stopped – enabling police to post footage as soon as the case has finished.

As part of the joint campaign between police in Surrey and Sussex, officers have released a video of a driver high on the horse tranquilliser ketamine who was stopped a few days before Christmas last year.

Jason Fray, 29, was ordered to prove he was fit to drive by walking in a straight line – but can clearly be seen weaving unsteadily as he tackles the task.

The operation aims to crack down on all motoring offences in the run-up to Christmas and officers will also tweet details about when and where motorists are pulled over for both drink-drive and drug offences.

Warning posters will be placed at the spot where drivers were arrested during last year’s campaign, while the public are being encouraged to text officers with details of anyone they suspect of drink or drug-driving.

To raise awareness of their campaign the forces have released footage of Jason Fray, arrested last year 

Sergeant Jane Derrick, the head of roads policing across Sussex and Surrey, said a ‘small minority’ of motorists refused to believe the law applied to them.

Last December, 211 were arrested on suspicion of drink or drug-driving in Sussex. Just 135 have so far being convicted of offences. Another five are still going through the courts.

In a move to tackle such delays and get rogue drivers off the roads quickly, extra time is being set aside at Crawley Magistrates’ Court in West Sussex to deal with those charged from tomorrow.

It could result in charged motorists being banned from the roads within ten days of being caught, according to police.

Struggle: After being told to walk in a straight line by a female officer, 29-year-old Fray is seen missing it completely and has to steady himself before failing the task entirely

Drug use: Fray is seen shrugging his shoulders as if unaware of why he cannot perform the basic tasks before admitting he had been using horse tranquilliser ketamine

Sgt Derrick added: ‘There is often a delay of a matter of weeks between an individual being charged and them appearing in court. But these slots mean those charged with offences early in December could be dealt with by magistrates and banned from the roads in time for Christmas.

‘There is no excuse for driving while over the limit or after taking drugs but there remains a small minority who refuse to believe that the law applies to them.’

Fray, from Southwater in West Sussex, was convicted of being in charge of a vehicle while unfit through drugs and was banned from driving for four months, fined £250 and ordered to pay £85 costs and a £25 victim surcharge.
