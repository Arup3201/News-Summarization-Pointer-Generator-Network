An 1980s actor is now living on the streets battling drug addiction which ruined his chance at stardom.

Raised in Elswick, Newcastle, Jason Hoganson, 41, starred in the 1988 film Empire State alongside Irish actor Ray McAnally, Englishman Jamie Foreman and American actor Martin Landau but as his acting career started to take off, his home life spiralled out of control.

Now with permanent scars on his face, Hoganson is sleeping rough on the streets of Newcastle after getting involved with the wrong crowd, spending time in prison for various crimes and losing contact with his family.

He said: ‘I’m like the black sheep. 

‘My mum has done everything for me, she’s a really lovely woman, but my family have had enough and I don’t blame them.

‘I can’t keep putting them through this.’

Trouble
began from an early age and at 13-years-old he was taken into car when 
his mother Maureen was no longer to cope with his erratic behaviour.

He said: ‘I was put into care when I was 13 because of my behaviour.

‘I was just part of the gang in Elswick and used to follow the crowd, and that’s how I got into trouble.’

His chance to turn his life around came in 1987 when the producers of the low-budget film contacted his drama teacher looking for Geordie actors for a part in Empire State, a gritty drama set in 1980s London.

After auditioning more than 100 teenage hopefuls, producers offered Hoganson the part of Geordie drifter Pete.

The movie, directed by Ron Peck, was largely panned by the critics.

Hoganson said: ‘I was very good at drama at school.

‘I earned a lot of money doing that film, and met all the stars like Robson Green. 

‘Everything was going well but then my acting career was over and I just messed up everything in my life.’

Now,
after being released from his latest prison sentence, Hoganson, who 
suffers from schizophrenia is preparing for another night sleeping rough
in Newcastle.

In 1996, the father-of-five was 
jailed for seven years for aggravated burglary in which he threatened a 
woman in her home and while in prison he lost contact with his children.

He said: ‘The children were only young and I decided it was best for them that I didn’t see them anymore.’

When he was released from jail in 2002, he was housed in various hostels but he was often disruptive and was eventually evicted.

Diagnosed with mental health problems, he spent many years as an outpatient at St Nicholas’ Hospital in Gosforth.

He was discharged in 2009, and by the end of that year was back in jail after being convicted of attacking his partner.

Now, following his released from a 
16-week prison sentence that was imposed after he was caught carrying a 
knife in public, Hoganson is living on the streets.

Met the stars: Hoganson was picked from 100 teenage hopefuls to play a Geordie drifter in the movie about 1980s London alongside Jamie Foreman (left) and Martin Landau (right)

Directed by Ron Peck, Empire State (scene pictured) was panned by critics but created an opportunity at stardom for Hoganson

He said: ‘I could have gone back and lived with my mum, but she is on her own and she’s got a beautiful house.

‘None of my family have got a criminal record.’

He
spends his days in city centre cafes, and his nights sleeping between 
rubbish bins but he said all he wants is somewhere to live in the hope 
that, one day, his children might visit him.

He
said: ‘It’s freezing out there and it’s only going to get worse but 
everywhere I go just pushes me away and says they can’t help me.

‘All
I need is my own little place. That would mean that if any of my 
children wanted to come and see me in later life, they could. 

‘I have missed so much of their lives and no amount of money can get that back.’
