Memory swipes: Samantha McDonald says she has been abducted by aliens

A British woman claims she has been abducted by aliens on repeated visits since she first made contact with them in the 1990s.

Samantha McDonald told a sceptical Phillip Schofield and Holly Willoughby on This Morning how she has experienced supernatural activity from the early 1990s until last year.

She describes her extraterrestrial visitors as 'the reptilians' and 'the greys' - who she believes are working together.

She said: 'I've asked them what they want with me and 
they have said they had come to take me and my family. What they were 
after was my energy and soul essence.

'I don't know why they keep coming 
back to me. I think it is to do with my energies as I'm into healing and
 meditation.'

When asked to describe what happens when she's taken, Samantha said she has no recollection of her ordeals.

She explained: 'You don't 
always remember the abductions because you have memory swipes. You just 
feel like you have been somewhere but you don't actually remember it.'

When Phillip queried if this is what most of us what describe as a dream she replied: 'No definitely not. I've woken up with marks all over my body and been possessed - 
sometimes to the point of mind control - where thoughts come into your head 
that are not your own. I can't explain it any other way.'

She added that she has woken up to find her body covered in needle marks, scratches and bruises after an abduction.

While she hasn't had a visit for the past year, Samantha said she doesn't fear a return.

'I've been through so much already I try to take it in my stride,' she said.

She revealed that she believes her other-worldly experiences have also led to her being put under surveillance on Earth, stating she often has black helicopters over her home and has been followed by police cars. ''I think they are trying to send the message, "we are watching you, you better be careful"', Samantha said of the not so subtle surveillance.

Samantha appeared on the ITV show as part of their 'supernatural week' along with Joanne Summerscales, founder of the AMMACH Project (which stands for Anomalous Mind Management Abductee Contactee Helpline).

Joanne said that through her work on the project, which is designed to support those 'usually ridiculed by mainstream "conventionals"' she has found many common threads in experience of those who say they have been abducted by aliens.

Like Samantha claims, many say they have woken up to find themselves covered in unexplained injuries and seem to be under surveillance.

'It's really common. The frequency of helicopter sightings over people who have had alien abductions is phenomenal,' she said.

Joanne said she didn't believe sleep paralysis was an explanation for why people feel they have experienced alien abduction, even though the symptoms of the condition include an temporary inability to move, a feeling someone is in the room, hallucinations and sometimes unconsciously self harming.

Supernatural: Other This Morning viewers said they have experienced UFOs

Joanne
 said some of these people have been examined by MRI scans and black 
light frequency 48 hours after their experience and this has shown 
florescent marks such as handprints on their bodies.

She said she is never incredulous about the supernatural stories people tell her.

'We have to treat people who say this has happened to them with respect,' she said. 'I don't believe in aliens, I know about them, so it's not about believing but knowing.'

During the rest of the week, This Morning will meet a number of people who claim to have had supernatural experiences - from ghost sightings to telekinesis.

Ahead of the special week, the show asked viewers for their views on the supernatural.

Their survey of 1500 men and women found that almost one in three think they may have seen a UFO and the same number think they have seen a ghost.

Nearly one in five had visited a medium but almost half of them felt cheated by the person claiming to have psychic powers.

A third say they have experienced items vanishing or moving or odd bumps in the night. Sixty per cent don't believe it's possible to move an object with the power of your mind but 20 per cent believe you can have sex with ghosts.

The results also revealed that Samantha isn't the only one to feel a victim of alien abduction, as four per cent said it had also happened to them.

A
 spokesman from This Morning said: 'Our viewers are fascinated by the 
supernatural and these survey results show that many have had an 
encounter with a ghost, seen UFO's and would like to make contact with 
the dead.

'During
 the week our hosts - some reluctantly - will explore the supernatural 
world more closely with experts and will also try to find evidence of 
the afterlife themselves.'

Indeed, a phone in from viewers later in the today's show revealed others have had experiences of UFOs. One said they had seen a strange flying object while driving late at night while another said they had seen crop circles and believed aliens were trying to communicate with us via our food.

Supernatural Week is on ITV's This Morning each day this week from 10.30am. For more details visit www.itv.com/thismorning
