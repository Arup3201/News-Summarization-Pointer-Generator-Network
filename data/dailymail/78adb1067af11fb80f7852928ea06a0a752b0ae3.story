The European Tour has received a massive shot in the arm with the news that leading American Patrick Reed has taken out membership — and he is unlikely to prove the only one.

Rickie Fowler, who makes his Middle East debut alongside Rory McIlroy in the first round of the Abu Dhabi HSBC Championship on Thursday morning, revealed he is giving serious consideration to becoming a member as well.

Reed opened the PGA Tour season with a win in Hawaii on Monday to become only the fifth player in the past quarter-century to win four times in America before the age of 25. The others were McIlroy, Sergio Garcia, Tiger Woods and Phil Mickelson.

It is an enormous coup, then, for him to take out tour membership on this side of the Atlantic as well.

‘Exciting times,’ the 24-year-old tweeted, alongside a photograph of his membership badge.

The last high-profile American to take out European Tour membership was former Masters Champion Zach Johnson in 2009, and before him other one-time major winners such as Open champions Ben Curtis and Todd Hamilton, and USPGA champions Shaun Micheel and Rich Beem.

But Reed’s is arguably a far more exciting development, for not only are all his prime years in front of him, it could also act as a catalyst.

After generations when leading Americans were largely content to stay at home, the ambitious Reed and the driven Fowler are keen to sample different cultures and courses to become more complete golfers than is possible simply by playing the largely one-dimensional game required in America.

Jordan Spieth, the other outstanding American under the age of 26, showed a similar willingness when he won the Australian Open in December.

Reed came to prominence on this side of the Atlantic at Gleneagles when he was by far and away the top American at the Ryder Cup. Two weeks later he returned for the World Match Play Championship in London — and a love affair was born.

He made it clear that week he was keen on broadening his horizons, and by taking out membership he has shown how keen.

If truth be told, European Tour membership makes perfect sense for those with ambition. Given the four majors and the four WGC (World Golf Championship) events count, a player just has to compete in five other tournaments to meet the minimum membership requirement.

Take Fowler. He is playing here, the Irish Open and the Scottish Open.

If he follows his appearance in the HSBC WGC-Champions event in Shanghai in November by staying to play in the BMW Masters, he will be eligible to play in the final event in the Race to Dubai and so fulfil the criteria.

‘It’s definitely something I am thinking about going forward,’ said the Californian.

‘When you think it’s only a few more events and if you’re playing well you can really be part of the Race to Dubai, it’s definitely a possibility.’

Exciting times and not just for Reed, at the start of the traditional three-week Middle East swing that signals a new campaign, with all eyes on Fowler and McIlroy this morning.

These two forged something of a burgeoning rivalry last year, and while Fowler lost out narrowly at The Open and the USPGA and received a fearful walloping in the singles at the Ryder Cup, he’s smart enough and good enough to ensure that future trophy presentations are at least tinged with his trademark orange.

‘I feel we’re just at the start of what’s going to be a lot of fun and some heated battles at times over the rest of our careers,’ said Fowler. ‘We all know how good Rory is, and if he gets his driving going like he did last summer, that’s something I can’t match up with as far as distance goes.

‘But I don’t feel like my game is any weaker than his, or anything like that.

‘I’ve beaten him a couple of times in the past and I believe I will come out on top a few more times in the future.’

Fowler, 26, finished in the top five in all four majors last year, with the somewhat mixed blessing of becoming the only player ever to achieve that feat without winning one.

The USPGA was the one that really hurt, but even there he only bowed the knee owing to some stunning play from McIlroy down the stretch. And so it is only right they march stride by stride over the first two days here. It might just set the tone for the season.
