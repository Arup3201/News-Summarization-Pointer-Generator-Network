Former Australia coach Robbie Deans once described Adam Ashley-Cooper as the glue that held the Wallabies together and rarely has the versatile back's ability to bring coherence to the side been needed more than in his 100th test.

And the 30-year-old celebrated his upcoming century of caps by dressing as a cricketer for a team photo.

The fallout from the row over texts allegedly sent by Kurtley Beale about a team official in June have left the Wallabies in crisis and coach Ewen McKenzie clinging to job by his finger nails ahead of Saturday's test against New Zealand.

If the Wallabies respond at Lang Park with the sort of backs-to-the-wall performance that the more optimistic Australians are hoping for, you can be sure Ashley-Cooper will be at the heart of it.

The 30-year-old has mostly taken a back seat to more spotlight-hungry team mates in the nine years since he made his test debut against South Africa in extraordinary circumstances in Perth in 2005.

While the more vaunted talents have all suffered fluctuations in form or fortune, however, Ashley-Cooper has rarely had a bad game whether at fullback, in the centres or on the wing, where he will start on Saturday.

Such reliability has earned him nicknames like 'Mr Fix-it' or 'Mr. Dependable' in the media but to his team-mates it is 'Swoop' who will join George Gregan, Nathan Sharpe, George Smith, Stephen Larkham and David Campese as an Australian test centurion.

'Adam has had a remarkable career and he deserves the accolades which come with joining what is an extremely elite group of players to have played 100 games for Australia,' McKenzie said this week.

'It's a massive honour and a true testament of his ability to play at a consistently high level over such a long period of time.'
