Google CEO Larry Page stopped talking to co-founder and long-time friend Sergey Brin after his affair with Google Glass marketer Amanda Rosenberg emerged, friends have revealed.

Brin, 40, split with his wife and mother of his two children, Anne Wojcicki, last year after she found 'alarming' emails between Brin and 27-year-old Rosenberg. The pair then began dating.

But this did not sit well with Page, his co-founder and a friend since college who had witnessed Brin's blossoming romance with Wojcicki when the couple met in 1998.

'It was inappropriate,' a source told Vanity Fair of Brin and Rosenberg's relationship.

'Larry is so ethically 
strict... I heard Larry was insanely upset by this whole situation 
and wasn't talking to Sergey' for a time.

Brin and Wojcicki, who had been married for six years before they split 10 months ago, began drifting apart after the launch of Google Glass, the article noted.

In its early days, Rosenberg, a marketer on the project, had spent time with Wojcicki, a prominent Biotech analyst and businesswoman, to understand how to target mothers with the gadget.

The two women became friends at the end of 2012 - close enough that Wojcicki bought Rosenberg a Christmas present - and Brin and Wojcicki went out to dinners with Rosenberg and her then boyfriend, Hugo Barra, a high-ranking executive for Google's Android team, Vanity Fair reported.

But around the same time, Wojcicki came across emails that 'caused her alarm', a source said, and she approached Rosenberg about it.

In April 2013, Brin moved out of their $7 million Los Altos home to another property they owned nearby but they kept the split quiet until August.

At the time, Rosenberg continued to date Barra, an M.I.T graduate and prized member of the creative product team, while also seeing Brin, the article noted.

Barra, then unaware of the affair, was planning to move to Hong Kong with Rosenberg after being offered a job by a Chinese mobile phone company, sources said.

But in May, Rosenberg broke up with him without giving him a reason, and after the Brin relationship publicly emerged a few months later, he announced he was moving to Hong Kong alone.

In January, Rosenberg revealed on her blog that she was being treated for depression.

'It became increasingly difficult for me to make decisions. I had no empathy for anyone, and I started to crave solitude,' the British-born Google employee wrote.

'The worst part was that it became harder to face people, even those I loved. It felt much better to be holed up on my sofa for unhealthy periods of time.

'Darkness surged through my veins and permeated my eyeballs. All the feelings I’d hoarded over the years were now rushing through me in one go and all I wanted was a one-way ticket back to numbsville.'

She added: 'I'm in treatment and have been for 6 weeks. Reaching out for help is the single best and bravest decision I have ever made.'

A family friend told Vanity Fair that her relationship with Brin has also seen its troubles.

'The two of them have horrible, screaming fights,' the friend said. 'It's part of the passion, the chemical attraction.'

Brin and Wojcicki, who shared a $30 billion wealth and have two children under the age of six, are not divorced and have no plans to seek one, according to Vanity Fair.

The
 article also notes that it was not the only affair at Google, which 
does not explicitly ban inter-office relationships. Page and Yahoo! CEO 
Marissa Mayer also had a relationship, it claims.

Rosenberg joined Google after graduating with a communications degree from Leeds University in England.

She had previously been educated at £31,000-a-year Marlborough school, where Kate Middleton had previously been a pupil.

Pippa Middleton was two years ahead of Rosenberg.

In an internet profile Miss 
Rosenberg wrote of herself: ‘I’m part of the master race that is the 
Chinese Jew or Chew, if you will.

'Born in Hong Kong but bred in the UK. A
 misanthrope who’s bad at maths, so I got the worst of both worlds.’

Elsewhere
 she declared that her motto is: ‘He who hesitates is a damned fool.’

Miss Rosenberg is understood to have an English father and a Hong Kong 
Chinese mother who worked as an investment banker.

Long-time friends: Page and Brin, pictured in 2003, met while at Stanford University in the mid 1990s

She initially worked for the internet giant in London before last year moving to San Francisco to work at its Silicon Valley nerve center.

She soon won a role promoting Google Glass, the glasses which enable users to film and broadcast over the internet everything they see non-stop, worrying privacy campaigners.

She also came up with the idea to say 'OK, Glass' to switch it on.
