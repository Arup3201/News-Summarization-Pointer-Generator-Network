A daredevil has taken parkour to its limits by performing reckless stunts from a moving, tilted truck.

Abdullah Omar AlAli, 21, got into the street gymnastics craze just a year ago in his home city of Dubai, United Arab Emirates - but backflips and handstands on park benches were just not enough.

Instead he pulls his stunts from a Toyota Land Cruiser, which a driver tips precariously onto two wheels in another dangerous procedure known as 'sidewalk skiing'.

Talented: The daredevil accepts that what he does is dangerous, but says he wants to draw attention to the thrill of parkour for everyone

Mr AlAli, who has no formal training but a black belt in Taekwondo, begins his stunts by climbing out of the truck's rear driver side window while it is moving on its side.

He then scrambles onto the top where he performs handstands and backflips and even gives a salute to his cameraman.

Inspired by military obstacle courses, parkour involves turning everyday pieces of street furniture into objects to be ducked under, swung from, vaulted and climbed.

The discipline has in turn inspired freerunning, the urban athletics movement followed by tens thousands of people around the world.

'Sidewalk skiing' is another dangerous craze altogether, and was popularised in 2013 by a team of daredevils in neighbouring Saudi Arabia.

To tip a truck onto its side a driver usually uses an asymmetrical ramp, then there is the difficult part - balancing it without allowing it to tip over while a daredevil scrambles into position on top.

Mr AlAli now wants to push parkour even closer to its limits.

'While the stunt is risky, I wanted to show how far people could push their skills with this sport,' he said.

'My inspiration is Dubai's Prime Minster Sheikh Mohammed who said that UAE does not have a word for impossible - it does not exist in our lexicon'.

Mr AlAli also explained that his next goal is to create a parkour training facility where people all over the region can come and discover the sport.

He said: 'I want to convince the municipality to provide a park made especially for parkour so they can attract more people, who can practice and teach in a safe place.

'I want to show the world that the UAE is a place where you can find talented people.'

Poise: The truck is not moving in all of his shots, but must be when it tilts on its side - with a driver who is able to keep it balanced

Don't try this at home: With long stretches of highway and more than enough desert, the UAE is a suitable place to develop the craze
