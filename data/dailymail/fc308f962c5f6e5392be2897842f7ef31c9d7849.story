As the Premier League season gets going, Sportsmail looks at players new to the top flight with the potential to light up England's top tier over the coming campaign.

ALBERTO MORENO IN A NUTSHELL

Alberto Moreno was taught a harsh lesson on Monday night against reigning champions Manchester City - don't dawdle or you'll be caught out.

It is a lesson every player new to the Premier League must learn and this particular 22-year-old was taught in the cruelest way imaginable, gifting Stevan Jovetic the  opening goal on his debut.

Liverpool ultimately lost 3-1, but don't let that deter you from buying the left-back with a winger's soul.

Moreno's £12million move to Liverpool from Sevilla, where he once held a 30m euro buy-out clause, remains one full of promise. And you can be sure the Spaniard won't dally on the ball in the box anymore - Brendan Rodgers will be sure of that.

Oops: Alberto Moreno looks on as Stevan Jovetic scores the opening goal against Liverpool on Monday night

Mistake: Moreno's error led to the opening goal for City but the defender will have learned a valuable lesson

No dawdling! Moreno is a left-back with a winger's soul and his £12million move to Liverpool is one of potential

Born: Sevilla, Spain, July 5 1992 (age 22)

2011-2013: Sevilla B (49 apps, 8 gls)

2012-2014: Sevilla (45, 3)

2014-NOW: Liverpool (1, 0)

2013-NOW: Spain (3, 0) 

WHAT WILL MORENO BRING TO MY TEAM?

Points. Simple as that. The defender is at Liverpool, a team determined to show their title surge last year was not a fluke.

And Rodgers is a man who knows bidding to become champions starts at the back, which means clean-sheets galore for those of you willing to spend £5.6m on the 5ft 7in Spaniard.

Granted, Moreno made a mistake in his first-ever Premier League game but still held a 90.5 per cent pass completion rate against arguably the toughest opponents in the top division.

Last year at Sevilla, he chipped in with three La Liga goals and began to average a shot a game. Will he up his accuracy at Anfield? It may be worth a shot...

Debutant: Moreno was taught a harsh lesson on Monday evening against reigning champions  City

Potential: Moreno once held a 30m euro buy-out clause at Sevilla and has started to show an attacking side

At £5.6m, Moreno is a steal. That's cheaper than a host of players who may not even make it into their side's starting XIs!

STOP SUGAR-COATING IT - HOW WILL HE GET ME POINTS?

An appearance earns you two points - check. A win earns you three more - check. A clean-sheet will add another four - check. It'll add up week in, week out when it comes to a player of Moreno's quality.

And lest we forget, a goal from the defender adds 10 every time! He found his shooting boots last season in La Liga so he will come to England full of confidence to nab the occasional goal.

BUT CAN HE HANDLE THE PREMIER LEAGUE? 

Two years ago Moreno was a Sevilla reserve player. He beat off competition to become a first-team regular, earned three caps for Spain along the way, and is now at Liverpool. 

Quite the transition in just two short years for the 22-year-old, who clearly has potential in his locker.

Adjustment time is always needed - that's a given - but Moreno won't be alone in settling in.

Former U21 team-mate and friend David de Gea is just a short drive away, as is Alvaro Negredo. And if they don't feel like a chat in his native tongue, his new manager Rodgers speaks fluent Spanish.

Adding up: A goal from the defender adds 10 points every time and Moreno found his shooting boots last year

Ready: Moreno will come to England full of confidence to nab the occasional goal, particularly in front of the Kop

DON'T JUST TAKE OUR WORD FOR IT... 

If ever you need convincing that Moreno has a place tied down in the Liverpool starting XI, then Rodgers is here to put your mind at ease.

'(Moreno) has got huge potential,' Rodgers told Liverpool's official website. 'He's a really exciting young player. When you watch him, he's very attack-minded, very quick and he serves the ball really well.

'At 22, he's hungry to succeed. He has got improvements to make but he's one of the players we've brought in this summer who is ready to play straight away.

'We had a practice game here last week and he looked very good. He's one who is coming straight out of La Liga. He's come from the Europa League champions.

'He's done great. Last season he was one of the top left-backs in Europe and was highly sought after. He's a boy that will fit well into our way of working.' 

Instructions: Moreno was a Sevilla reserve player two years ago but upped the ranks and was capped for Spain

I'M NOT SURE... CAN HE HANDLE IT? 

He will thrive off Anfield. Some players might shy away from the intense atmosphere - not Moreno.

He’s a football fan who grew up watching a Sevilla side that won back-to-back UEFA Cups and two Spanish Cups six-to-seven years ago under Juande Ramos. He stood on the stands of the Sanchez Pizjuan and cheered on Alves and Co as a teenager.

He knows what those in the Kop and surrounding stands want to see, and will endeavour to bring it.  

 Atmosphere: Moreno used to go watch Sevilla as a teenager and will know what the fans at Anfield want to see
