A dying Vietnam veteran has been told he must repay $6,300 he received in pension benefits - despite the fact the payments were made in error by the Department of Veterans Affairs.

Rob Arthur, 68, was diagnosed with terminal brain cancer in January and soon after married his girlfriend Debbie Shafer.

They live together in a trailer at the foot of the Cascade Mountains in Washington.

Weeks after the wedding, he informed Veterans Affairs of the change in his marital status and her income as a nurse's aide - which is just $22,000 a year.

But due to a paperwork backlog, it took six months for Mr Arthur to receive a reply.  

They informed him that he was no longer eligible for a pension, as his income had increased due to his wife's wages.

He was told he would have to repay the benefits he received from January to June while his paperwork was being processed, which amounted to $6,324.

But Mr Arthur says he accepts the loss of his $1,000-a-month pension, but he disagrees with having to pay back the amount the VA is demanding.

Despite this, his wife recently sent a $5 check to start paying off the debt. 

Mr Arthur told The Seattle Times: 'They are mental abusers right now, is the way I look at it. And that's not a kind way to look at your government. 

'We got knocked down, and now they are stomping on us. We don't have the money to pay them.'

Mr Arthur, who is now requesting a hardship exemption, added: 'We simply cannot afford to survive should we be held responsible for this.'

A VA spokesman said their actions follow federal law.

Mr Arthur, who is originally from Montana, joined the Navy aged 17 in 1964, serving as a boiler on a destroyer tender in Vietnam.

As a result of a fall at sea, Mr Arthur says he suffered from a degenerative disease of the spine, but the VA did not approve him for disability compensation.

It was only in 1998 that he began collecting a VA pension when he was destitute and no longer able to work as a canvas maker.
