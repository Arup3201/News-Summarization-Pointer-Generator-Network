A single mother on benefits accused of leaving a rented home with £2,000 worth of damage has claimed vandals kicked in the back door and ransacked the property after she left.

Christine Lucas, 32, is accused of leaving a rented property in Blackpool with filthy carpets, obscene graffiti on the walls, and dog mess covering the yard.

In two years, her family turned the 
‘immaculate’ three-bedroom terrace into a hovel, said 
landlord Sean Feeney, 69.

They knocked over furniture, ruined carpets 
and left rotting food in the £140-a-week home, he claims, before moving to a council property.

'Disgusting': A single mother of two has been accused of leaving this Blackpool terrace in a terrible state - with rubbish strewn across the floor, rotting food all over the home and dog mess covering the back yard

Rubbish: The landlord of the three-bedroom home says Christine Lucas, 32, left graffiti (circled) scrawled across the walls of the £140-a-week home and piles of debris on the floor

Not to blame: Miss Lucas has today insisted she is not responsible for the mess - and says vandals broke in after she left and destroyed the home, which she left in a 'spotless' state

Mr Feeney said: 
‘They have vandalised it and left it in a sorry state, but the council 
have given these people a brand new council house.

'I don’t know how 
people can treat a property like this then get a new one.

‘This
 lot behaved no better than a pack of wild animals. The carpet was so 
filthy my feet stuck to the floor.

'They haven’t worked hard for anything
 in the house so they have no respect for it.’

A
 neighbour said: ‘She had a lot of people staying at the house and some
 dogs. They had parties with noise at night and music blaring.’

But defiant Miss Lucas told the Mail last night she was not to be blamed.

Filth: More rubbish in another of the rooms. Miss Lucas denies she was a 'dirty' tenant, and says the landlord refused to do repairs while she and her two children stayed in the property

Ruin: A wardrobe lies flat in one of the bedrooms. The former tenant says she is furious at what has been said about her and she is seeking legal advice

Instead, she insists, the mess was 
caused by vandals who kicked in the back door after she and her  two 
children aged seven and five, left.

She
 admitted being in rent arrears, which she said was due to her benefits 
being cut, and claimed the landlord had failed to fix several problems 
including leaks and damp.

She said: ‘I’m a good person, I’ve got a heart of gold. I’m not happy with what’s been said about me.’

She claimed the only party she had held was a birthday party for the children which she had warned neighbours about.

The family moved out on April 7 and came back the following day to tidy, leaving it ‘spotless’, she says.

Mess: Mr Feeney says he will have to spend hundreds of pounds on the property to restore it to its former state. Miss Lucas has moved into a council house and is a full-time carer to her sick mother

Furious: Mr Feeney said of the property: 'They have vandalised it and left it in a sorry state, but the council have given these people a brand new council house. This lot behaved no better than a pack of wild animals'

But the house was then burgled, she 
said, and she was being falsely accused of breaking the door to the 
electricity meter, writing graffiti in lipstick on the walls and burning
 the dining room rug.

She said: ‘Why would I do such a thing? I am really not happy about these false allegations and I am seeking legal advice.

‘I was a good tenant to start off with, until I fell behind with the rent, but I took out a £1,000 loan to pay off most of the arrears but the money was stolen from me.

‘I told the landlord about the repairs needing doing, but nothing was done.

'I even had the Environmental Health people out twice and they gave him time to get the repairs done, but they weren’t.’

'I have a heart of gold': Miss Lucas, pictured outside her new home, admits she fell behind with rent. She says she was forced to take out a loan to pay off the arrears, but claims the money was stolen from her

Told that the landlord said she was a ‘dirty’ tenant, she said: ‘He was a dirty landlord.

'If he’d done the repairs I’d asked him to do, even though I was behind in the rent, I could have been there.’

Miss Lucas shares her newly-built new three-bedroom council house with her sick mother, who she cares for full time.

Mr Feeney, a 
retired builder, spent £5,000 renovating the property - but says 
he will now have to pay hundreds more to repair the damage left behind 
by Miss Lucas.

Blackpool councillor Gillian Campbell said: ‘This shows how vitally important tenant referencing and background checks are.’
