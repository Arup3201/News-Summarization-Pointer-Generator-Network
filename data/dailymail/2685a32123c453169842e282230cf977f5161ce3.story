Tottenham have agreed a £4million move for Sporting Lisbon centre back Eric Dier, subject to a medical.

Spurs have seen off interest from Newcastle and West Ham to secure a five-year deal for the Englishman as Mauricio Pochettino adds more strength to a backline that conceded 51 times last season.

The 20-year-old was born in Cheltenham but moved to Portugal with his family when he was seven years old. He was picked up by Sporting scouts and has advanced through their academy to break into their first team.

Sporting's academy is renowned for producing top quality youngsters, and Dier is in good company with Cristiano Ronaldo and Luis Figo as fellow graduates.

A versatile defensive player, hecan also provide cover at right back and in defensive midfield and becomes Spurs' third signing of the summer after Michael Vorm and Ben Davies from Swansea.

A club statement said: 'We are delighted to announce that we have reached agreement with Sporting Lisbon for the transfer of Eric Dier, subject to a medical.

In the past Dier has been reported as saying: 'Ultimately, I want to test myself against the best and the Premier League is where I dream about playing.'

Spurs are also showing an interest in Mateo Musacchio of Villarreal. The 23-year-old is a tough Argentine defender who has impressed a lot of scouts but his buy-out clause is £39million.

Meanwhile, Iago Falque is expected to complete a £4m move to Genoa.
