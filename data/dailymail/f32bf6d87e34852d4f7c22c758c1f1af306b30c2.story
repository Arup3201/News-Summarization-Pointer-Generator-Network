Justin Thomas tied the course record to take a share of the lead at the Sony Open in Hawaii.

The 21-year-old American carded a 61 on day two at the Waialae Country Club in Honolulu and now sits top of the leaderboard alongside Matt Kuchar and Webb Simpson on 12 under overall.

Thomas made an inauspicious start on Friday, but kicked his round into over drive with a hat-trick of birdies on the 16th, 17th and 18th holes.

Webb Simpson also earned a share of the lead at the half-way point of the Sony Open in Hawaii 

After the turn he notched two more before finishing off his day in supreme style with back-to-back birdies on seven and eight before sinking an 18-foot eagle putt on the five-par ninth.

Kuchar put in a steady display, with a blemish-free round of 63 that was boosted by consecutive putts from more than 25 feet for birdies on the 12th and 13th holes.

Simpson, who was an overnight leader alongside Englishman Paul Casey, bogeyed his fifth hole of the day but recovered by picking up five shots to retain his standing at the top.

Casey, meanwhile, endured a more difficult second day and hit four bogeys as he made a par 70 to slip four shots behind the leaders.

Ahead of him, South African Tim Clark was a model of consistency as he hit his second successive 65 to take a share of second place on 10 under.

He was joined by American Troy Merritt, who made light of a change in putter and swing, and after the morning wave the pair shared the lead before being pipped to the halfway post.

Merritt explained afterwards that the changes were down to a desire to boost his short game and that decision came off as he found six birdies and no bogeys.

'When you don't have any confidence in the short game you start playing a little bit more conservative into greens,' he told the PGA Tour website.

'And for me that usually brings out more mistakes, so it brings out the worst in the short game, too.'

He added: 'When I played really well at Boise State, I was releasing the club and hitting a draw.

'So I'm trying to kind of get back to that a little bit more, which is kind of a tough thing to do, to go from aiming 15 yards left to now looking 15 yards right and hoping it goes the other way.'

Equipment was more of a problem for Matt Every, who was disqualified for using a non-conforming club on the 18th hole.

Every, who started on the back nine and was already well out of contention, bent his four iron on the first day and forgot to replace it before round two.

When he pointed it out to an official he was disqualified having played a shot with the club.

'He asked for a second opinion on the bend,' rules official John Mutch told the PGA Tour website. 'The bend in this club was about 10 inches up from the neck. It was substantial.'

Elsewhere, Scot Russell Knox is three shots behind on nine under alongside Rory Sabbatini, while defending Sony Open champion Jimmy Walker is in a six-strong cluster on eight under.

American teenager Kyle Suppa, 16, shot his second 69 in two days to make the cut and extend his weekend's golf.
