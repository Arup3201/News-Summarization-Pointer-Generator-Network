Jemima Khan has revealed that her late friend Princess Diana was so 'madly in love' with Hasnat Khan, she considered moving to Pakistan to be with him.

In a  Vanity Fair article titled: 'The Grandmother Prince George Never Knew', Jemima says Diana, who dated the heart surgeon from 1995-97, sought her advice during fundraising visits to Lahore.

'She wanted to know how hard it had 
been for me to adapt to life in Pakistan,' Jemima told the magazine's contributing editor Sarah Ellison.

'Both times she also went to meet [Hasnat's] family secretly to discuss the 
possibility of marriage.'

Indeed, Diana was apparently desperately 
keen to impress Hasnat's immediate family, especially his mother.

But in spite of her best efforts, it would appear that this second love would see Diana yet again falling on the wrong side of an influential family.

Even though Diana had an aristocratic lineage, had married (and divorced) Prince Charles, and was mother of the heir to the British throne, Naheed Khan was unlikely to approve of her son contemplating marriage with an English woman.

'[For a] son to marry an English girl is every conservative Pashtun mother’s 
worst nightmare,' Jemima said.

'You send your son to be 
educated in England and he comes back with an English bride. It’s 
something they dread.'

Though
the couple discussed marriage and children (friends of Diana told the 
magazine that she had wanted a daughter with Hasnat), the relationship 
fell apart around the time that she met Dodi Al Fayed.

Diana's friend Rosa Monckton says Hasnat was the one who initiated the break-up, but other friends argue that Diana ended it because the surgeon refused to marry her.

In fact, Rosa insists to this 
day that Diana's relationship with Dodi was only to make Hasnat 
jealous.

It would seem that marriage was certainly a point that divided the couple. According to Jemima, Hasnat 'hated the thought of being in the glare of publicity for the rest of his life.'

And indeed, in his interview as part of the Lord Stevens inquiry into Diana's death, he called marriage 'a ridiculous idea', adding that he 'told her that the only 
way I could see us having a vaguely normal life together would be if we 
went to Pakistan, as the press don’t bother you there.'

Diana's relationship with Hasnat is at the centre of the upcoming film Diana, starring Naomi Watts in the title role.

Despite this fact, Vanity Fair reveals Hasnat refused to cooperate with filmmakers, remaining very much the man Diana once described to a friend as 'the one person who will never sell me out.'

The September issue of Vanity Fair will be available on newsstands in New York and LA on August 1 and nationally on the iPad, Nook, and Kindle on August 6.

It will be available on newsstands in the UK on August 2.
