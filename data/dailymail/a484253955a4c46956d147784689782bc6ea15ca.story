Domestic violence charges were abruptly dropped on Monday against Carolina Panthers defensive end Greg Hardy after his accuser could not be found to testify, prosecutors said.

District attorneys wanted his his ex-girlfriend, Nicole Holder, to testify at his jury trial slated to begin in Charlotte on Monday. He was accused of assaulting Holder and threatening to kill her.

However, Holder has eluded all law enforcement authorities' attempts to contact--and subpoena--her since November while leaving a trail of Facebook travel photos from the Rocky Mountains to Midtown Manhattan.

According to prosecutors, Holder reached a civil settlement of undisclosed terms well before the trial.  

If Holder's Facebook photos are any indication, the former cocktail waitress has found a way to move on. 

Hardy, a five-year NFL veteran, was found guilty by a district court judge in July but, under North Carolina law, appealed the verdict and was then allowed to have a jury trial. 

According to the Charlotte Observer, Holder left her job at the nightclub Suite in Charlotte sometime in August. 

By November, the DA's office had lost contact with her. On December 8, she photographed herself dining at a Denver, Colorado restaurant.

Next, on that same day, she posted photos of her self snowmobiling in the posh resort town of Vail.

On December 22, she posted photos as she shopped at a high end Atlanta mall.

Holder, who police in May said was taken to the emergency room following an altercation with Hardy, stopped contacting prosecutors in November and by December had embarked on a cross-country leisure tour

The following day, she was posing for photo in New York City's Grand Central Station.

'The victim appears to have intentionally made herself unavailable to the state,' the District Attorney's Office said in a statement. 'Without her testimony in this particular instance, the state could not proceed.' 

The National Football League placed Hardy on the commissioner's exempt list in September, meaning he was taken off the field but continued to receive his $13.1 million salary.

Hardy's suspension will remain in effect until the matter is reviewed, NFL spokesman Brian McCarthy said after the case was dismissed.

Several of the NFL's top players, including Adrian Peterson and Ray Rice, were charged with domestic violence in 2014, prompting the league to overhaul its personal conduct policy.

Sharply criticized for being too lenient on domestic violence and sexual assault, NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell made the penalties for such crimes much harsher than in the past. 

Holder worked as a cocktail waitress until around August. Before Hardy's most recent trial date, he and Holder reached a civil settlement that prosecutors believe centered on the alleged assault

Hardy, a 2013 Pro Bowler who played only one game for the Panthers before being suspended last season, will become a free agent next month and it was uncertain if Carolina would re-sign the former sixth-round draft choice out of Mississippi.

'Greg remains on the commissioner's exempt list and the NFL has advised us to allow it to complete its review under the Personal Conduct Policy,' the Panthers said in a statement. 'There is no change in his status at this time.'

He was accused of assaulting Holder at his Charlotte condominium in May, sending her to the hospital emergency room.

Prosecutors said when she last spoke with them in November, Holder told them that she 'did not want to participate in another trial.' 

Hardy, wearing a dark suit and white tennis shoes, left the Mecklenburg County Courthouse without speaking to reporters.
