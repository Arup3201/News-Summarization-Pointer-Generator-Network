This is Margaret, the runt of her litter who becomes Britain's oldest cat next week when she reaches her 25th birthday - or 116th in human years.

Sarah Dixon picked Margaret out of a litter in Acomb, North Yorkshire, when she was a kitten - and they have since lived in four different homes together.

Ms Dixon puts her ginger cat's longevity down to a meat-rich diet, which includes tuna and chicken breast rather than cat food.

The previous claim to the title of Britain's oldest cat was held by Rosie, from Clitheroe, Lancashire, who died last year at the age of 25.

Paws for thought: Despite being the runt of her litter, the cat has lived to a record age, in four different houses

Ms Dixon, 43, said: 'When I saw her, I knew I wanted her. The sign said free to a good home so I had her, we have been best friends since.

'I know lots of people with cats, but I don’t know anyone else with one that has reached 25.

'She takes life a bit easier now, she likes to relax quite a bit.'

Margaret, who lives in Stamford Bridge, East Riding, with Ms Dixon, has outlived five feline companions during her long life.

Ms Dixon, a mother of two, said: 'She has been with me through two home births and she has lived in four different houses with me.

'She has been part of my life for all these years and has outlived five other cats.'

Margaret’s upcoming birthday will make her 116 in human years, and Ms Dixon believes the key to her longevity lies in her diet.

She said: 'It’s only in the past year she has eaten cat food. Most of the time she eats tuna and meat and she likes to lead a quiet life.'

The record of oldest cat in the world is held by Creme Puff, from Austin, Texas, who died in 2005 aged 38.

While the exact date of Margaret’s birth is not known, Ms Dixon says she was born in mid January 1988.

The pampered puss will be celebrating the big day in style next week by feasting on a chicken breast.
