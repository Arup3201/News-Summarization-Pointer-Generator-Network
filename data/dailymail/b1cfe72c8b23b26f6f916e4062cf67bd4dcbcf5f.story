Restaurants in Saudi Arabia have banned single women from entering because of their 'mentally unstable' behaviour such as using flirting, smoking and using mobile phones.

Several restaurants have put up signs that say 'women are not allowed' in another blow for women's rights in the conservative Muslim kingdom.

There is no law banning women from travelling alone in Saudi Arabia but deeply-held religious beliefs dictate that they should be accompanied by a male family member when out in public.

According to The Week, one restaurant owner said: 'We put up these signs because we have seen numerous incidents of flirting taking place inside the restaurant.

'We'll only remove these signs when we make sure such incidents never happen again on our premises because such type of behaviour negatively impacts our business.'

Bloggers in the Middle Eastern state also described women who smoke and use mobile phones as 'mentally unstable'. 

One wrote: 'The best thing is to keep women away from restaurants unless they have a male custodian.

'That way the restaurant is not shut down because of the misbehaviour of an adolescent or mentally unstable woman.'

The blogger added that one woman crossed the line when she came in alone and 'focused on her mobile'.

Another online post said some women visiting restaurants had no respect.

A man called Talal said: 'My brother has a restaurant and he says that even though there is a section for families, there are often instances of embarrassment. 

'Several women would come in and would speak loudly without any respect for public behaviour. He says that it is difficult for him to get them to lower their voices.'  

Saudi Arabia has one of the worst record's for women's rights in the world. 

Women will be allowed to vote and run for office in local elections for the first time next year but are still not allowed to drive.

There are no laws on the minimum age it is legal to marry at, with father's giving their daughters a way when they are just nine years old in some cases.

Women can ride bicycles, but only in 'recreational areas' if they are wearing full Islamic body coverings and are accompanied by a male guardian. 

Khalid Al Fakhri, the head of Saudi Arabia's National Society for Human Rights, said: 'These signs are against the law and reflect the personal opinions of the restaurant owners.'
