In times of famine, some animals go to desperate measures to stay alive, including eating members of their own species.

Now scientists have captured one of the first cases of cannibalism in hippopotamuses on camera.

The grisly photographs show a hippo eating a corpse of another floating in a river in South Africa’s Kruger National Park.

Scientists have captured one of the first cases of cannibalism in hippopotamuses on camera. The grisly photographs (one pictured) show a hippo eating a corpse of another floating in a river in South Africa’s Kruger National Park. They are not sure why the act occured

They were taken by biologist Leejiah Dorward while on safari last year.

He told National Geographic: ‘I was completely amazed. It was something I had never heard of.’

Having returned to London, the PhD student discovered that cannibalism in hippos has only been described once before, in 1999.

While hippos are herbivores, other scientists have seen them deviate from their diet of grasses and the occasional aquatic plant to feast on impala - a medium-sized antelope.

The other instance of hippo cannibalism occurred during a severe drought.

Dr David Pfenning, a biologist at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, explained that cannibalism is one way for creatures to get all the nutrients they need in one convenient package.

When Mr Dorward recorded the act of cannibalism, he noticed that the region had lush grass (seen in this image) which makes up the bulk of a hippo's diet. The only other record of cannibalism in the species was seen in the midst of a severe drought

Hippos leave water at dusk to travel up to six miles (10km) inland to graze on grasses. They spend almost all the rest of the time in rivers and lakes.

Grass is their main source of food, and they consume around 150lbs (68kg) of it every night, over around five hours.

They occasionally eat aquatic plants.

There have been reports of hippos eating impala and carrion but their stomachs are not suited to a meaty diet and meat eating is thought to be driven by drought and desperation.

Hippos are born with sterile intestines and require bacteria obtained from their mothers' faeces to digest vegetation.

For example, Mormon crickets migrate on mass during food shortages and if one stops marching, others will devour it, because their fellow katydid is a good source of protein and salt, needed by the insects.

However, animals that feast on their own species run the risk of catching a disease.

Most animals usually only resort to eating their own species during times of extreme hardship, when the risk of catching a disease is less then starving to death.

Crocodiles, for example, are known to eat their young when there is no other food available and sometimes scavenge corpses.

However, when Mr Dorward recorded the act of cannibalism, he noticed that the region had lush grass. The event was documented in the African Journal of Ecology.

To solve the mystery of why the hippo ate the corpse, he wants to document other cases of cannibalism in the species in Africa.

‘Because the behaviour is so rare, we are relying on others to report it,’ he said.

Desperation: In times of famine, some animals go to desperate measures to stay alive, including eating members of their own species. For example, crocodiles have been known to eat their offspring when no other food is available.

Nutrition: Mormon crickets migrate on mass during food shortages and if one stops marching, others will devour it, because their fellow katydid is a good source of protein and salt, needed by the insects. Cannibalism is a convenient way to get all the nutrients an animal needs, but they run the risk of more easily catching diseases.

Female rattlesnakes eat stillborn or non-viable offspring to recover some of their strength, Discover reported.

Crab spiders eat eggs and their mother over the course of weeks until she is immobile and dies, Science News reported, allowing offspring to be heavier and to have a better chance at survival.

Stress: Stressed screech owls have been known to eat a mate when adapting to a new environment, although the behaviour is rare.

Sex: Male Australian redback spiders are often eaten by females during copulation. While the male perishes, the copulation time is extended, increasing his chance of passing on his genes. The act isn't unusual in spiders and some insects such as the praying mantis.

Survival of infants: In what is perhaps the ultimate competition for food, sand sharks eat their younger siblings while still in the womb to give themselves the best chance of survival.

Tiger salamanders come in two larval forms - normal and cannibalistic. The cannibals develop faster and have wider jaws and sharper teeth to chomp on their siblings.

Dominance and competition: Male lions sometimes kill a younger lion that is challenging leadership of the pride. If the young imposter wins, he may kill cubs to make room for his own offspring.

In 1977, famous conservationist Jane Goodall reported cannibalism in male and chimpanzees. It was presumed for years that the act was unusual, but in 2007, experts came to the conclusion that it was a behaviour designed to cut competition for food and mates, after seeing gentler female chimps eating others.

Mystery: Sometimes experts have no idea why one animal eats another. Keepers at Smithsonian’s National Zoo in Washington DC saw a mother sloth bear eating one of her own cubs. The mother, named Khali, had raised offspring before, leaving experts baffled as to what prompted her to eat the small bear.
