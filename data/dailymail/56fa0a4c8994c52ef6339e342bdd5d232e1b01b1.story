Google and Microsoft last night faced demands to act over the shocking ease with which child killer Mark Bridger used the internet to fuel his perversion.

Bridger, sentenced yesterday to spend the rest of his life in jail for murdering five-year-old April Jones, had a sickening library of violent child pornography.

It follows the revelation that Stuart Hazell, the man convicted earlier this month of killing 12-year-old Tia Sharp, regularly downloaded child abuse images on his mobile phone.

Locked up: April Jones's killer Mark Bridger is pictured in drag. He had a sickening library of child pornography

Jailed: Sexual predator and murderer Mark Bridger is taken from court to start his whole life sentence in jail

Children’s charities and online protection experts are now calling for search sites to crack down on the way paedophiles can feed their fantasies with simple online searches.

The verdict on 47-year-old Bridger, a former slaughterman, was delivered as:

Bridger used the search engines Google and Bing, which is owned by Microsoft, to look up terms including ‘naked five-year-old girls’, ‘nudism five-year-olds’ and ‘pictures of naked virgin teens’.

Mother and daughter: Coral Jones cuddles smiling April tightly. She described how the family will never recover from her death

He also used Facebook to access  photographs of local girls, including  April and her half-sisters aged 13 and 16, and went online to save images of murdered Soham schoolgirls Holly Wells and Jessica Chapman.

Child safety charities, including the NSPCC, demanded that the internet giants introduce immediate controls to stop paedophiles gaining access to child pornography.

John Carr of the Children’s Charities’ Coalition on Internet Safety said: ‘If these images were not available on the internet then men like Hazell and Bridger might not go on to kill.

‘We cannot blame the internet for these people but it has opened pathways that lead them on to violent pornography and paedophile material.’

After five weeks of horrifying evidence at Mold Crown Court in North Wales, the jury of nine women and three men unanimously found Bridger guilty of abduction, murder and perverting the course of justice.

Mr Justice Griffith Williams told him: ‘You are a pathological and glib liar. There is no doubt in my mind that you are a paedophile who has for some time harboured sexual and morbid fantasies about young girls, storing on your laptop not only images of pre-pubescent and pubescent girls, but foul pornography of the gross sexual abuse of young children.’

Bridger stared ahead blankly and nodded as the judge imposed a whole life order, which condemns him to die behind bars. Only 47 other criminals in the UK have been handed such a sentence.

Fantasist: Mark Bridger, who is 'pathological liar and cold-blooded killer', will never leave jail  and waiting people yelled 'b******' as he was taken in cuffs to the man 

Brave: April Jones's mother Coral spoke outside court, beside her husband Paul, and said they were relieved that Mark Bridger was found guilty

Bridger abducted April on the evening 
of October 1 last year as she played on her pink bicycle with her best 
friend close to their homes on the Bryn-y-Gog estate in Machynlleth, 
Mid-Wales.

He lured April 
into his Land Rover Discovery and drove her to Mount Pleasant Cottage, 
the remote rented home where he had been living alone since his 
girlfriend dumped him.

There, police believe, Bridger murdered her, dismembering her body before disposing of it in different locations.

Despite
a huge effort by police and volunteers, April has never been found. 
Tiny fragments of a child’s skull, however, were discovered in Bridger’s
wood burning stove, alongside a boning knife.

On
his Acer laptop, detectives found an incriminating library of vile 
images. He had found the violent child porn by searching on Google for 
simple terms, including: ‘France: British schoolgirl raped and 
murdered.’

Trial: Mark Bridger faces life in prison for the murder of April Jones, 
after the jury accepted compelling evidence he had abducted and murdered
her in a  'sexually motivated' attack

Happier times: Paul and Coral Jones, hold April and their other children on their wedding day, before their 'beautiful daughter' was taken from them

Bridger saved 
photographs of various child murder victims, including ten-year-olds 
Holly Wells and Jessica Chapman, murdered by paedophile school caretaker
Ian Huntley in 2002.

He had also downloaded numerous sadistic cartoons representing ‘extremely young girls’ suffering sexual abuse.

Facebook
photographs of local young girls were also found on his laptop, with 
files specifically dedicated to April’s half-sisters aged 13 and 16.

Pictures
of April, who had cerebral  palsy and was born with a hole in her 
heart, were accessed just eight days before she was abducted.

Bridger
admitted killing April, but insisted he accidentally ran her over 
before ‘blacking out’ and forgetting what he did with her body.

Brave: Paul and Coral Jones, the parents of April Jones arrive at Mold Crown Court, where they have been every day during their daughter's killer's murder trial 

Tragic: April Jones was abducted while she played on her bike (pictured), probably lured by Bridger into his car with the promise of a sleepover with his daughter

Cold-blooded: Killer Mark Bridger had pictures of himself holding this gun on his Facebook profile

Grim discovery: Mark Bridger's burnt knife recovered from his property in Ceinws, where April may have died

But
his despicable web of lies was destroyed by April’s best friend. The 
seven-year-old girl became the central  witness in the case, bravely 
describing  seeing April climb into Bridger’s car, ‘happy and smiling’. 
Yesterday, as the  jury dismissed his pathetic cover story, experts 
spoke about how his obsession with online porn, and the ease with  which
he could access the vile images, contributed to his ‘sexually 
motivated’ attack on April.

Jon Brown of the NSPCC said: ‘Internet companies make millions and millions of pounds every year.

‘Google
need to do more in terms of blocking searches for child abuse imagery 
but they also need to alert the authorities if someone is blatantly 
doing these searches.

Arrival: The media watch as Mark Bridger arrives in a prison before he is found guilty of killing the five-year-old

‘We are very concerned that the ease with which they can get child abuse images to fuel their fantasies.’

A
report by the Child Exploitation and Online Protection Centre has 
identified a link between viewing child porn online and ‘contact’ sexual
offences against children.

Scott
Rubin, director of communications and public affairs at Google, said: 
‘Google has a zero-tolerance policy on child sexual abuse content. When 
we discover child abuse imagery or are made aware of it,  we respond 
quickly to remove and report it to the appropriate law enforcement 
authorities.’

A spokesman 
for Microsoft added:  ‘When we are made aware of any illegal content we 
remove it from our services, including our search engine, and report it 
to the police.’

Upsetting: April Jones was shown on CCTV inside her local leisure centre after going swimming. The time shows almost 5.30pm and within two hours she had disappeared

Video: April is then seen heading through the doors after swimming with her sister and best friend - the last image that exists of the missing schoolgirl

Evil: The jury saw images of Bridger's Land Rover Discovery heading away from town - April would already have been in the passenger seat after being abducted near her home

Images: The jury were show Mark Bridger leaving his house and walking his dog on the day after he took April Jones

Lounge: This is Mark Bridger's living room, where forensics found blood and bone fragments, a room which was shown to jurors
