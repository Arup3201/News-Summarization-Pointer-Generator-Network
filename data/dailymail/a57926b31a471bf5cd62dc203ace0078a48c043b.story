Marcos Rojo is relishing the prospect of his Manchester United debut after finally obtaining his work permit on Friday.

The defender signed for Louis van Gaal's side in a £16million deal ahead of their 1-1 draw with Sunderland two weeks ago, but has been ineligible to play until now due to a lengthy visa application process.

Rojo is currently away on international duty with Argentina, playing alongside new club team-mate Angel di Maria in a 4-2 win against Germany that was a repeat of July's World Cup Final on Wednesday night, but could make his club debut next weekend at home to QPR.

'I am desperate to get onto the field and play because I have not been able to step onto Old Trafford [yet],' said Rojo, whilst on international duty with Argentina this week.

'My life has changed a lot. I am very happy to be at Manchester United, a top team in the world, sharing a dressing room with players like Wayne Rooney, Robin Van Persie, Angel Di Maria and now Radamel Falcao.

'This is a very important step in my career as a player and as a person. Everything that has happened to me since the World Cup has been a dream.'
