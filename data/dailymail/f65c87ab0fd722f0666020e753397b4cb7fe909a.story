An Oakland neighborhood is in shock after an 8-year-old girl was killed and two young children were injured when an apartment was left riddled with bullets Wednesday night.

Alaysha Carradine, 8, was killed and two of her friends, Amara York, 7 and her 4-year-old brother, ended up in the hospital when a gunman opened fire on the house they were in just at about 11:15 Wednesday night, according to reports.

York’s 63-year-old grandmother was  also shot in the leg, but her injuries are non-life threatening.  Khamel Hardin,22,  was upstairs at the time of the attack and went unharmed. Police have not yet released the names of the other victims.

‘It was like it was a bomb, an explosion, just going off so quick,’ Hardin told the San Francisco Chronicle.

The attack came when York ran to answer the doorbell, thinking it was her mother, according to KPIX. Instead, she was met with a hail of bullets but somehow survived the attack.

Bullets tore through both the security door and the wooden door behind it, as well as the walls of the apartment and a back window, blood could be seen on the carpet inside.

Carradine was at the apartment, where she is reportedly a regular visitor, because her mother was away on vacation in Washington, D.C., according to reports. Jesse Fowler, 24, also of Oakland, and the girl’s step father, was left to tell the dead eight-year-old’s mother the terrible news.

‘I just want to know why you would shoot up a houseful of kids. Where do you get the satisfaction in that?’ Fowler asked a number of local reporters after saying he was at a loss to understand such a senseless act. Fowler added that Carradine is also survived by a younger brother that he and her mother will have a hard time explaining to why his sister is no longer around.

'I know the kids didn't do anything to deserve this,' Sharon Smith, who was watching Carradine and let her stay over York's house told multiple local reporters, adding 'it's just heartbreaking.'

Set to join the third grade in a few months, Carradine loved school, reading and  modeling, according to reports. She was planning to go to a modeling competition with York Thursday afternoon, KPIX noted.

‘She's not doing too good,’ Fowler told NBC Bay Area of Alaysha's mother, ‘She doesn't want to accept it.’

Saying he has heard gun shots before, neighbour Fre Lee, 52, told the paper that he ‘used to see those kids laughing, playing out front… they were so sweet.’

Horrific: Blood stains were visible inside the apartment where three children and an elderly lady were mercilessly shot late Wednesday night

Interim Oakland Police Chief Sean Whent and Mayor Jean Quan visited the two injured children at a local hospital Thursday, teddy bears in-hand, according to reports.

Officials have not named any suspects, but have announced a $25,000 reward for any information leading to an arrest.
