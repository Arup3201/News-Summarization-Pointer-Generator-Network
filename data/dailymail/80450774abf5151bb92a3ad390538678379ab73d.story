Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti is hoping the force is with him as he tries to squeeze his city into contention for Star War creator George Lucas' new museum that will be home to everything from Darth Vader's costume to the Millennium Falcon.

Dueling Chicago and San Francisco have already drawn their metaphorical lightsaber's in hope of becoming home to the $300 million museum which will hold the life's collection of art and props the billionaire filmmaker has accrued.

Using social media to boost his campaign, Garcetti, 43, has encouraged Angelenos to tweet their reasons why the Lucas Cultural Arts Museum should come to their city with the hashtag #WhyLucasInLA, including the obvious, 'The Force is strongest in Los Angeles!'

On his website, the mayor posted a picture of himself holding a sign of a drawing of R2-D2, with the insignia 'LA' drawn across the iconic robot from Star Wars.

'This center presents such an amazing opportunity to inspire creativity, especially in our youth,' wrote Garcetti in an open letter to Lucas and his wife, Mellody Hobson, a Chicago native.

'We’d like you to consider opening your museum in a place where its impact can be amplified like no other, Los Angeles.'

Boasting art work from greats such as Norman Rockwell and his own movies such as Indiana Jones and Star Wars, the proposed $300 million museum's new home will be decided by Lucas in the next few weeks.

Endorsement: The mayor encouraged citizens of LA to tweet reasons why George Lucas should have his museum in the city

Logic: Others decided that with a burgeoning tourist industry, Los Angeles would be the perfect place for the museum

Marketing: One Twitter user decided that the logos used by the billionaire creator of Star Wars would be enticing

Decision makers: Mellody Hobson and husband George Lucas will ultimately decide where the museum will be

A spokesman for Lucas, who is paying for the museum himself through his own trust, said that the legendary filmmaker, who is a graduate of the University of Southern California and lives near San Francisco, would decide soon.

'Since the beginning of this process, we have indicated that several cities had expressed an interest in the possible location of the Lucas Cultural Arts Museum,' Perry said to Bloomberg News.

'We are grateful for everyone’s enthusiasm for this project.'

Los Angeles wants Lucas to build the museum in Exposition Park, which is also home to the California Science Center and the Natural History Center.

Museum pieces: Darth Vader Costume designed by Trisha Biggar for Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith and Yoda designed by Ralph McQuarrie are destined to take their places in George Lucas' new $300 million permanent museum

Beauty: The Palace of Theed on Naboo from 1999's The Phantom Menace designed by Scott Squires, Doug Chiang, Steve Gawley will take its place in the Lucas Cultural Arts Museum when it is built either in Los Angeles, Chicago or San Francisco

Iconic: A battle Droid full-size model and the costume for Queen Amidala's Senate Gown both seen in The Phantom Menace will also take their place in the eventual museum

Boys dream: Millennium Falcon scale model built for 1977's Star Wars A New Hope will also form part of the Lucas Cultural Arts Museum

However, they are facing stiff competition from Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel and San Francisco Mayor Ed Lee for the museum which will house work by artists such as Norman Rockwell, prints from Disney movies and Lucas' own creations.

Chicago has offered two parking lots near Soldier Field and McCormick Place. Alternatively, San Francisco has offered a seaside lot near the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge.

The semi-retired Lucas described his proposed museum as 'a dedication to cultural fantasy' in an interview with CBS in March.

Groundbreaking: A still from Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines - whose special CGI effects were created by George Lucas' Industrial Light and Magic team

King: Visual effects for 1993's Jurassic Park were also pioneered by George Lucas's team at Industrial Light and Magic

Family favorites: George Lucas was also instrumental in the founding of DreamWorks studios and animation - which spawned Shrek and its sequels

Ahoy: The CGI effects that transformed Bill Nighy into Davy Jones for 2006's Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest were created by Industrial Light and Magic

'Part of the museum is designed to educate younger people into the idea of storytelling, into the idea of being able to paint your fantasies, which is what 'Star Wars' was,' he said.

'Star Wars' was there to inspire young people to imagine things, to imagine going anywhere in the universe and doing anything you want to do and using your imagination to entertain yourself.'

Lucas bought his first work of art, a page from one of Walt Disney's Uncle Scrooge comic books, for $25 when he was a University of Southern California film student.

Since then, he has amassed a collection of 150 years of what he calls 'fantastical' art.

Original: This print depicting Scrooge McDuck and his money bin was the first piece of film art purchased by George Lucas in 1972

In a letter accompanying his proposal, Lucas described a childhood trip from his home in Modesto to the de Young Museum in San Francisco as life changing.

'I was drawn in by Norman Rockwell's ability to tell a complete story in a single image,' he wrote. 'It was then that I began to learn the art of visual storytelling.'

Lucas has never made a film on a Hollywood lot, choosing instead to build his Lucasfilm empire in San Francisco.

Last year he sold his eponymous special effects and film production unit - along with the rights to Star Wars and Indiana Jones - to Disney for $4 billion.
