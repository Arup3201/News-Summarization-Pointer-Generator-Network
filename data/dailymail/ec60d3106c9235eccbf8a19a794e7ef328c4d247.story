Huddersfield Town are looking to beat Newcastle and Crewe to non-League sensation Che Adams.

The 18-year-old Ilkeston winger, who was called up to the England C squad last week, has a number of clubs interested in his signature including Nottingham Forest, Burnley and Norwich City and is out of contract in the summer.

However, Huddersfield are understood to have discussed a £100,000 offer ahead of the January transfer window to fend off their rivals.

Ilkeston chairman Dave Mantle said: 'It would be wrong of us to stand in his way if a good opportunity arises for him to move to a higher level.' 

The former Coventry City trainee has taken the Evo-Stik Premier Division by storm since breaking into the first team last season scoring some vital and spectacular goals.

Talking to the Ilkeston Advertiser, Adams said: 'Playing under pressure is good for me but at the same time I don’t want to make any mistakes when the scouts are watching.

'It’s really important I stay disciplined and keep concentrating because that’s helped me so far and I feel both the team and I have benefited. It’s hard to believe some of the clubs I’ve been linked with but it’s obviously a massive thrill and exciting as well.

Newcastle United manager Alan Pardew is among those interested in the 18-year-old non-League starlet

'It’s a tough level to come in at as you’re being kicked everywhere every week but that physical side of it is good as it toughens you up.

'I think it’s been better to play first team football here than, for example, to have stayed at Coventry where lads my age are being released without having played a competitive game.

'I just want to play football and keep working hard for Ilkeston. That’s the way I’ve always been, and whatever will happen in the future will happen.'
