Bouncier than a space hopper and smoother than spun silk, there's no doubt the Duchess of Cambridge's hair was a triumph on tour Down Under.

And the secret of her swingy, super-glossy 'rich girl hair'? It's rumoured that last year Kate switched allegiances from Richard Ward's salon in Sloane Square to VIP favourite Rossano Ferretti's in London's Fitzrovia.

Ferretti is the hairdresser behind Angelina Jolie's amazing locks and his stylists are also said to tend the tresses of Pippa Middleton, and actresses Jennifer Lawrence and Salma Hayek. Here Pol Garcia, Ferretti's artistic director, tells INDIA STURGIS the ten secrets of how to get the 'rich girl' look.

A good cut is the essential foundation to natural, glossy, highend hair. If you can afford it, 'The Method' is the best haircut in the world.

Developed 20 years ago by Rossano Ferretti, today it costs from £120 to £1,000, and takes anything from an hour to almost a whole day. It's about maximising a client's natural beauty by considering how each strand of hair falls.

It takes into account the hair's texture, thickness, glossiness, length, colour, cut and density. I trained for two and a half years to master it. First we shampoo and condition, then give a moisturising treatment and head massage.

To cut the hair we use patented scissors that were designed by Ferretti and are hand-made in Italy. They have little gaps cut into the bottom blade so most of it is blunt - they cut only 8 per cent of the hair at a time, creating delicate, soft lines for an ultra-feminine look. We use three cutting techniques for 'The Method'.

No worries on a windy day: The Duchess' hair always falls into place thanks to the 'the method' cutting technique

One is called 'inserire' (Italian for 'enter'), which involves carving layers into small sections of hair that won't be visible when the cut is finished but add body and movement.

Then there's 'uscita' ('exit'), which means slicing fingers through hair to guide the scissors. Lastly there's 'uscita ruotare' ('rotating exit'), which involves turning the hair in your fingers, at a precise angle, for a more accurate cut.

Once the cut is finished the hair is blow-dried and styled, though it will look fine if left to air-dry. The two shades rule The closer you keep your hair to its natural colour, the better and glossier it is. Dye it too light or dark and you ruin the follicles, which dry out and break during brushing.

Volume: Use vegetable dye for shiny hair like Kate's

This is because stronger chemicals are needed to make more dramatic colour changes. As a rule, ask your hairdresser to go only two shades lighter or darker than your natural hue. Fair complexions can get away with a shade or two lighter than this.

The only way to cover grey hair is with permanent colour, but be regimented with its upkeep. Refreshing roots can be necessary every ten days.

We don't do hair extensions except by special request. I almost always advise against them. They are so bad for hair, weakening and pulling the follicles and leading to hair damage and loss.

Clipped-in extensions (which are cheaper) add less weight and drag marginally less than glue-ins but damage the hair as you take them in and out. At a push, clip-ins are slightly more acceptable for your hair's health - but only as a one-off for a special occasion. With the right cut you should sidestep the need for these altogether, and look naturally classier.

If you're considering highlights, ask for balayage (from the French 'to sweep') for extra depth and dimension. These are freestyle, hand-painted highlights which make hair look naturally sun-kissed and need less maintenance than more formulaic highlights (where traditional foiling or a colour cap is used) or solid block colour. They can last for up to four months before needing a touch-up.

After washing hair at home, lightly towel dry so it is still 80 per cent wet. This is when it is most manageable and you will be able to see the natural fall, weight and curl of your hair. Drying soaking wet hair takes longer and makes it harder to style.

Next, massage a volumising spray, foam or cream in at the roots with your fingers for height and texture. A mousse is best for fine, thin hair. Radial bristle brushes are the softest: they won't pull and achieve bounce, movement and body best under the dryer (Natural bristles radial hairbrush, £7.50, John Lewis).

A paddle brush is best if you want straight hair. To finish, mist a spray of hair oil (Davines hair oil, £21.05, salonskincare.co.uk) a short distance from the head while the hair is still damp.

No budget buys: Don't skimp on shampoo if you want 'rich girl hair'

Heat protection: Be careful of too hot thongs when styling hair and finish with a spray of hair oil

Some things you can skimp on, some you can't. A top-quality shampoo and conditioner is essential for luxurious, glossy locks. Unfortunately, supermarket own brands tend to turn hair ashen, with ingredients such as sulfates and sodium chloride stripping protective oils from the hair. The best shampoo and conditioner comes from the Shu Uemura sleek smoothing range (£19, lookfantastic.com), which delivers the best shine and volume I've ever come across.

Leave conditioner on for as long as possible so the maximum amount of protein - the natural building blocks of hair - can be absorbed to moisturise and smoothe. Leaving conditioner on for ten minutes is vital if you have coloured or thinning hair, as it helps to boost volume and shape.

Another trick is to shampoo, condition, then very lightly shampoo again to remove product build-up. This improves fine hair, which gets easily weighed down with conditioning masks and will look brighter and bouncier after drying.

Spring-clean your hair with a vegetable dye. These are natural colourants that aren't permanent. They are richly conditioning, coating each strand like a varnish rather than penetrating the cuticle. They will temporarily thicken the hair, adding volume and bounce and boosting shine.

The colour will fade over time but they are a good quick fix, and results can last for up to six shampoos.

We often use a moisturising hair mask on clients before cutting. A reviving hair treatment you can do at home i s Kérastase Chronologiste, which comes with little 'caviar' pearls for massaging into the scalp and a conditioning mask full of vitamin A and E, for stimulating hair growth and moisturising the scalp.

Leave it on for 15 minutes after shampooing, then rinse for glossy hair and a nourished, hydrated scalp (£64, vesira.com, one kit contains ten applications).

Your tongs, straighteners and curlers heat up to a maximum of 220c. That's hotter than you roast a chicken at, so think what it's doing to your hair!

Look on the packaging to see how hot your gadgets can get. Ideally set them to a medium heat setting - say, 180c - and use tongs sparingly. The thicker and coarser your hair, the higher temperature you'll need.

Protect hair before styling with a product such as Aveda Brilliant Damage Control (£16.50, aveda.co. uk). This is essential whatever your hair type.
