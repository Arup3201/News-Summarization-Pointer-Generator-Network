Barcelona superstar Neymar has posted a picture on Instagram with two of his team-mates as the La Liga leaders travel to Malaga attempting to continue their remarkable start to the season.

Neymar posted a plane photograph with Adriano and Douglas on Wednesday morning, in the lead-up to Barca's league match against Malaga.

Neymar and co. have won every single match so far this season, and are yet to concede a goal as they look to avenge their heartbreak end to the 13/14 campaign by winning La Liga this time around.

Luis Enrique's side have won 3-0, 0-1, 2-0, and 0-5 on their way to four wins from four in La Liga, while they beat Apoel Nicosia 1-0 in the Champions League last Wednesday.

Malaga, meanwhile, have won one game, drawn two, and lost one.

Barca are three points ahead of Real Madrid with a game in hand going into tonight's fixture, and if they win will extend their lead over their rivals after Madrid's difficult start to the season.
