Scientists have developed an anti-ageing cream containing a protein often used to heal the damage caused by a heart attack.

Avon’s new Clinical E-Defence deep recovery face cream contains thymosin, which can help to regenerate tissue in damaged human hearts.

Women who tested the £20 cream reported feeling eight years younger.

They were particularly happy to see that the fine lines on their 
foreheads, cheeks and around their eyes had started to fade away.

The night cream, which goes on sale today, is the first to harness the healing powers of thymosin beta-4.

The protein can also rejuvenate skin by attracting young, healthy cells to areas that have been damaged by age, pollution, sunlight and smoking.

But while levels of thymosin beta-4 are high in our late 20s and early 30s, they fall as we age.

Simply putting it into a cream would be of little use, as the molecule is too big to break its way through the surface of the skin.

So, scientists from Avon’s research and development department in New York screened more than two million compounds for ones that turn up the body’s own production of the protein.

They hit on two compounds, including a Himalayan plant used in Chinese medicine, and incorporated them into the cream.

The face cream also contains other ingredients designed to protect the skin against day to day wear and tear.

In tests, the lotion helped stop a cut apple from turning brown.

And used by women for two months, it improved the appearance of wrinkles by 30 per cent. 

Blotchiness was halved and sunspots a third better, according to a dermatologist’s assessment.

The women’s own opinions were equally glowing, with some saying they looked eight years younger.

Anthony Gonzalez, the Avon scientist behind the £20 cream’s development, said it was inspired by ‘powerful medical advances’.

He added: ‘What we are doing is bringing new, healthy cells to where they are needed.’
