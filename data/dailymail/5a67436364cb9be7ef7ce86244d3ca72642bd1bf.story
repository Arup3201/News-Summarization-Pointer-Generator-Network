Ed Miliband indulged in a spot of misty-eyed grandstanding in Glasgow yesterday morning. ‘This was a vote for No because we know we are better together,’ he opined.

‘To all the people who voted Yes, this Labour Party is determined to show that we can be the vehicle for your hopes, your dreams, your aspirations, for a better life for you, a better life for Scotland, a better life for the whole of the United Kingdom.’

It was windy stuff, packed with the sort of vacuous platitudes we’ve come to expect from a Labour leader who in recent weeks has looked more out of his depth than the Loch Ness monster. ‘Let us be able to tell our children, to tell our grandchildren, that we did not just keep our country together, we changed our country together . . .’ and so on.

Misty-eyed grandstanding: Mr Miliband in Glasgow with Alastair Darling and Scottish Labour's Johann Lamont

What he neglected to admit, of course, was that his own role in the No campaign has been shambolic from start to finish, culminating in the cancellation of an appearance in Edinburgh by his nervous minders after he was hijacked by a baying mob of 300 nationalists at a shopping centre.

The irony is that Labour, and by extension, its leader, should have been able to take for granted a huge bedrock of support in Scotland, where it has 41 MPs. With David Cameron’s ‘toff Tories’ being so toxic in Scotland (which has never forgiven Margaret Thatcher for the poll tax), it was always clear that Labour voters would decide the outcome of the referendum.

But Miliband had long neglected Scottish voters – and the Labour machine north of the border had become too complacent.

Three years ago, when Miliband was asked by the BBC to name the three contenders for the leadership of the Scottish Labour Party, he couldn’t. In recent months, he has been a relative stranger to Scotland, visiting only seven times since April.

The first occasion was to preside over a shadow cabinet meeting in Glasgow, which was rightly dismissed by the nationalists as a pathetic PR stunt. Significantly, four of the seven visits came in the past two weeks, after panic gripped the Labour hierarchy when a poll put the Yes campaign in the lead for the first time.

Far from providing a robust, inspiring leadership for the No campaign, Labour has on the whole been negative, unfocused, riven with personality splits, littered with political mistakes, and undermined by a sharp drop in membership which means the party could not mobilise enough troops.

Mutiny: Labour leader Ed Miliband faced a backlash from his own MPs over his take on English devolution

As the campaign progressed, it became clear that Ed Miliband had little to offer disillusioned Labour voters north of the border, other than a risible pledge that by voting ‘No’ they had nothing to worry about because he would be Prime Minister after the next general election.

Tellingly, a poll published in the past week revealed that Cameron leads Miliband by 17 points among Scottish voters: a devastating indictment for a Labour leader.

One of Miliband’s silliest ideas was the call for English towns to fly the Saltire to ‘show we achieve fairness, equality and social justice better together than we do apart’. The idea was ridiculed north of the border. Miliband also failed to persuade Len McCluskey, the general secretary of Unite, Britain’s largest trade union, to deploy his vast army of members on the streets of Scotland.

Desperate gamble: Miliband joined the other party leaders to make an 11th-hour pledge to Scots

But it was the Labour leader’s decision to sign an 11th-hour joint statement with Cameron and Nick Clegg, promising Holyrood more power after a No vote, which was not just a desperate gamble but a major strategic error.

It was perceived in Scotland as a gift for Alex Salmond. The SNP leader used the declaration to portray the Labour Party as being in bed with the ‘hated Tories’. Wherever Miliband and his entourage went after the declaration, they were drowned out by well-organised Yes campaigners armed with megaphones and chanting ‘traitors’ and ‘red Tories’.

One of the reasons the campaign lacked passion was Miliband’s decision to gift the leadership of the Better Together campaign to Alistair Darling, a likeable man of total integrity – and zero charisma.

A better choice would have been John Reid, who held a string of Cabinet posts, but stood down when Gordon Brown became Prime Minister. He was untainted by the economic collapse, and as a tough street fighter would have been more adept at countering Salmond’s unscrupulous wheeling and dealing.

Even after Darling’s woeful performance in the second TV debate with Salmond, the Labour leader resisted pressure to call up Brown, who has a huge following in Scotland, where he has been an MP since 1983.

But there was a problem: having worked closely alongside Brown for a decade, Miliband knows better than anyone how much the former PM and Darling despise each other. Brown was also barely on speaking terms with Douglas Alexander, the shadow foreign secretary, and Labour’s international aid spokesman, Jim Murphy – two other key figures in the Better Together team.

Thus, for months the bitter personality disputes that tore the last Labour government apart kept the biggest beast in the Scottish Labour jungle off the campaign trail. Only when Darling was visibly shrinking under the weight of responsibility was Brown unleashed, to spectacular effect.

Surge: On the eve of the poll, Brown delivered one of his finest speeches, which was steeped in history, and rippling with passion and fervour, all of which were noticeably absent from Darling’s workmanlike offerings

On the eve of the poll, Brown delivered one of his finest speeches, which was steeped in history, and rippling with passion and fervour, all of which were noticeably absent from Darling’s workmanlike offerings.

So why didn’t Miliband appeal to Brown sooner? One senior Labour source told us: ‘Gordon has been at his brilliant best, galvanising our supporters and sending bolts of energy through the campaign. He has been making the headlines for all the right reasons. Ed has been made to look very small by comparison in the past seven days. It’s why a lot of Ed’s people didn’t want Gordon to the fore.’

Equally, Miliband’s decision to rush into a joint statement with Cameron and Clegg – which had not been cleared by his own party – infuriated Labour frontbenchers such as Ed Balls. They woke up yesterday to hear Cameron pledging, in return for the increased powers he promised to Scotland, that for the first time English legislation will be the responsibility only of English MPs.

A Labour source said: ‘Miliband has castrated our 40-odd Scottish MPs. It could be disastrous and put us out of power for a generation. Serious up-and-coming Scottish politicians won’t want to go near Westminster. Gordon Brown might have had his faults, but if this rule is enforced it means MPs like Gordon would never have set foot in Westminster. No wonder the likes of Ed Balls are cross.’

Labour MPs are left asking themselves: if Ed Miliband couldn’t mobilise mass support in a country where the Tories are a spent force, what chance has he got of winning over doubters in the Conservatives’ southern heartlands?
