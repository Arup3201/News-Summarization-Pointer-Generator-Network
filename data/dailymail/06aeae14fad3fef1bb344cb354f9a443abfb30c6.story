Silent suspect: Dzhokhar Tsarnaev stopped talking when he was read his rights by police officials

Dzhokhar Tsarnaev reportedly showed 
no fear or any of sign of remorse during a makeshift court hearing held 
in his hospital room earlier this week.

The second Boston Marathon bomber was
still wounded and unable to talk during the hearing on Monday, but he 
didn't express any emotion when he was read his Miranda rights.

The only movements he made during the
Constitutionally-mandated interaction were when he mouthed the word 
'no' when asked if he could afford a lawyer, and when he nodded his head
to note that he did understand his rights.

According to a NBC source that was 
familiar with the controversial interaction, the 19-year-old suspect's 
heart monitor did not register even the slightest blip during the tense 
exchange, even when he was informed that he could receive the death 
penalty for his crimes.

'Over the weekend, he’s in and out of
lucidity. He’s got — he’s on medication, he’s talking, but he’s not 
talking, he’s unconscious, he’s going for medical procedures,' 
Congressman Mike Rogers told MSNBC on Thursday, having been briefed 
because of his role as chairman of the House Intelligence Committee.

In the official records, however, his state of mind was deemed sufficient for the proceedings to take place.

According to the transcript of the 
interaction, Judge Marianne Bowler reportedly said: 'I find the 
defendant is alert, mentally competent and lucid. He is aware of the 
nature of the proceedings.'

The legal proceedings came at a 
pivotal time in the investigation, as he was reportedly communicating 
with police via notepad until the moment he was read his rights, after 
which he stopped communicating.

It has been revealed that Dzhokhar 
Tsarnaev, 19, initially confessed to authorities that he and his older 
brother, Tamerlan Tsarnaev, 26, carried out the attacks during 16-hours 
of questioning over the weekend.

Dzhokhar
has been communicating with law enforcement officials by writing on a 
pad after suffering an injury to his throat during the frenzied manhunt 
for him which renders him unable to talk.

However,
the moment he was read his rights on Monday - which as a citizen of the
United States entitle him to the constitutional right to remain silent 
and seek a lawyer - he stopped communicating.

Indeed,
it has been claimed that federal agents were surprised when a 
magistrate judge and a representative from the U.S. Attorney's office 
entered the hospital room and read Tsarnaev his rights, four officials 
and one law enforcement official said.

Investigators had planned to keep questioning him.

This apparent confusion came after the White House decided against treating Tsarnaev as an enemy combatant.

It is unclear as to whether this will 
matter in court as the FBI says Tsarnaev has already confessed to a witness.

A spokeswoman for U.S. Attorney Carmen Ortiz said: 'Before being advised of his rights, 
the 19-year-old suspect told authorities that his older brother, 
Tamerlan Tsarnaev, 26, only recently had recruited him to be part of the
attack'.

Tsarnaev said he was behind the devastating terrorist attack. He spoke to police from his hospital bed. Whether suspected terrorists should be read their Miranda rights has become a controversial issue in the U.S

The debate over whether suspected 
terrorists should be read their Miranda rights has become a sticking point.

Many Repuplicans believe they hinder intelligence gathering.

The Department of Justice has said 
investigators may wait until they have gathered intelligence about other
threats before reading those rights in terrorism cases.

Investigators have found 
pieces of remote-control equipment among the debris and are analyzing 
them, officials said.

One official described the detonator as 'close-controlled,' meaning it had to be triggered within several blocks of the bombs.

A piece of remote control equipment has been found amongst the debris at the scene of the bombing. Experts say it would have been triggered just blocks away from the site of the bomb

Confused reports about the shootout in a Boston backyard have emerged. Officials now claim that Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was unarmed as he hid in boat in Watertown. This contradicts Boston Police Commissioner's account of hour-long firefight with Tsarnaev

Dzhokhar is recovering in a hospital 
from injuries suffered during a getaway attempt last Friday.

Police had 
previously said Dzhokhar exchanged gunfire with them for more than an 
hour last Friday before they captured him inside a boat in a suburban Boston neighbourhood.

But yesterday, two unnamed officials 
said that he was unarmed when captured, raising questions 
about the gunfire and how he was injured.

The report contradicts the Boston police department's own account of Dzhokar Tsarnaev's capture - after commissioner Ed Davies describes a firefight between him and officers before the terror suspect was captured.

More than 4,000 mourners at the 
Massachusetts Institute of Technology paid tribute to a campus police 
officer who authorities say was gunned down by the bombing 
suspects.

Among the speakers in Cambridge, just outside Boston, was Vice 
President Joe Biden, who condemned the bombing suspects as 'two twisted,
perverted, cowardly, knockoff jihadis.'

Mr Biden paid tribute to officer Sean Collier's family: 'The moment will come when the memory of 
Sean is triggered and you know it's going to be OK. The purpose of 
terror is to instill fear. You saw none of it here in Boston.
Boston, you sent a powerful message to the world.'

Investigators have said the 
brothers appeared to have been radicalized through jihadist materials on
the Internet and have found no evidence tying them to a terrorist 
group.

Dzhokhar told the FBI that they were angry about the U.S. wars in 
Afghanistan and Iraq and the killing of Muslims there, officials said.
