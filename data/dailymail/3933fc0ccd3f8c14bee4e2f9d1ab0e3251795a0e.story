Kevin Davies is certainly known as one of the most robust and dogged strikers to grace the Premier League and it seems this hasn’t worn off playing for his current side Preston.

The League One club led big-spending Manchester United until a late second-half comeback in a 3-1 FA Cup fifth-round defeat at Deepdale on Monday night.

Davies managed to play over an hour after team-mate Joe Garner accidentally crushed his left hand in the opening exchanges of the contest, with the Preston forward posting a picture on Twitter of the damage on Tuesday.

With only four minutes on the clock Davies was challenged by United’s Daley Blind and as the ball broke free, an eager Garner sprinted after it, but in doing so trampled on his strike partner’s hand.

The 37-year-old was his usual determined self and having received treatment on the touchline, quickly returned to action with his hand bandaged up.

However Davies tore off the strapping and battled away for the rest of the tie at full throttle with one particularly forceful tackle on Ander Herrera earning him a booking from referee Phil Dowd.

Davies caused the shaky United defence problems all evening before being replaced on 75 minutes by fellow forward Callum Robinson.

Unfortunately for the former Bolton striker his efforts and bravery were in vain as Louis van Gaal’s side prevailed 3-1 at Deepdale.

Scott Laird gave Preston the lead after 47 minutes when his deflected effort squeezed under David de Gea to send the home crowd delirious.
