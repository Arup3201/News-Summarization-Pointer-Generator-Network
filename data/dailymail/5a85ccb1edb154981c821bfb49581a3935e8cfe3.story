Not impressed: Sturridge wasn't a fan of Chamberlain's moves, but Raheem Sterling praised the Ox's efforts

However, Sturridge didn't seem impressed with his pal's efforts off the pitch in the Algarve.

Oxlade-Chamberlain missed Arsenal's FA Cup final win over Hull on Saturday with a groin injury, but showed no signs he is still being hampered by the problem with his fancy footwork.

'Everyone who loves football dreams of having an opportunity to go to a World Cup, so I'm grateful for having that opportunity,' said the 20-year-old.

'It's the best footballing occasion on earth and we are all really excited about it. We have to be positive.'
