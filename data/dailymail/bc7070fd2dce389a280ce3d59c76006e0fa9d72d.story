Militants fighting for Al Qaeda in Syria have released a chilling new propaganda video in which a young British jihadi describes life fighting on the frontline.

The unnamed man, who speaks with a southern English accent, is filmed complaining about a lack of toilets as he stands in a trench - believed to be somewhere in the forest outside Lattakia city.

Wearing digital camouflage and wielding a large assault rifle, the Al Qaeda militant reveals that although it is his ambition to die as a 'martyr', acting recklessly in order to achieve that is forbidden and he must avoid being hit by the sniper rounds heard popping and cracking in the background.

Jihadi: The unnamed man, who speaks with a southern English accent, is filmed complaining about a lack of toilets as he stands in a trench - believed to be somewhere in the forest outside Lattakia city

Radical: The British Al Qaeda fighter says that despite the difficulties of being covered in mud and 'having to go natural' due to the lack of toilet facilities, he considers it 'an honour to defend the Muslim blood'

Titled 'A Moment in Ribaat: Standing Guard in the Way of Allah', the two minute video does not feature the logo of any terror group, but it is understood the militant is a fighter for Jabhat al-Nusra, also known as Nusra Front - a branch of Al Qaeda operating in Syria.

He is not thought to be fighting for the Islamic State terror group, also known as ISIS. 

Described as 'A short reminder from the blessed land of Shaam', the propaganda footage is clearly designed to advertise the sacrifices Al Qaeda members are making in the name of their religion.

The clip begins with a short burst of religious chanting before cutting to HD-footage of the unnamed fighter sitting in a trench in a wooded area - believed to be on the frontline of fighting between the Al Qaeda-affiliated militants and soldiers fighting on behalf of the Syrian regime.

'It's a foggy, cold day. The enemy is quite close and you can hear their shots coming - heavy machine gun fire,' the jihadi says, as the crack and pop of AK47 rounds ring out in the background.

'That is fitnah of the head,' he adds, using an Arabic word meaning distress or mentally challenging.

He adds that despite the difficulties of being covered in mud and 'having to go natural' due to the lack of toilet facilities, he considers it 'an honour to defend the Muslim blood'.

Heavily armed: Wearing digital camouflage and wielding a large assault rifle, the Al Qaeda militant reveals that although it is his ambition to die as a 'martyr', acting recklessly in order to achieve that is forbidden

Professional: Titled 'A Moment in Ribaat: Standing Guard in the Way of Allah', the two minute video does not feature the logo of any terror group, but it is understood the militant is a fighter for Jabhat al-Nusra

The video is the first to be uploaded to a YouTube account titled 'Brit in Shaam', which suggests it may well be part of a series of Al Qaeda propaganda releases featuring the fighter.

The use of high-definition cameras and the use of a British fighter apes the professionally shot and edited video releases by the Islamic State terror group - which have included the sickening filmed beheadings of several Western hostages, including two Britons.

In the Al Qaeda release, the militant is seen standing up in the trench, saying 'From time to time you have to keep peering up. The only problem is if you stick your head up for too long, a sniper can take your head out'.

'Of course we all want shahada [martyrdom] but we can't be reckless about these things. If it comes it comes but the priority of the mujahideen is to protect his life and stand guard,' he adds.

The militant goes on to add that 'while villages and towns in that direction live their ordinary lives, we are here on the frontline, the mujahideen Alhamdulillah [thanks be to God]'.

One of at least four airmen captured by Al Qaeda militants after their Syrian Air Force helicopter crash-landed has appeared in a new propaganda video that calls for the release of a radical cleric.

The pilot, who was captured near Jabal al-Zawiya in Idlib province, is seen looking dazed with bandages wrapped around his head as notorious jihadi Abdullah al-Muhaysini rants alongside him while wielding a massive knife and an assault rifle.

Al-Muhaysini, who has long been affiliated with Al Qaeda-linked groups in Syria, suggests the life of the airman will only be spared if the Syrian regime releases notorious jihadi Abu Mus'ab as-Suri, who is wanted in Spain for suspected links to the 1985 El Descanso and 2004 Madrid bombings.

Fear: The captured pilot is seen looking dazed with bandages wrapped around his head as notorious jihadi Abdullah al-Muhaysini rants alongside him while wielding a massive knife and an assault rifle

The video shows the airman looking dazed as he sits on the floor of a darkened room with the notorious black and white banner of Al Qaeda's Syrian affiliate Jabhat al-Nusra behind him.

Clearly suffering injuries as a result of the helicopter crash, the pilot still has bloodied bandages wrapped around his head.

The footage is decidedly amateur, is clearly filmed on either a mobile phone or a cheap recording device - making it look nothing like the slick, professionally edited videos put out by Nusra's rival jihadi group Islamic State.

Nevertheless, the sight of Al-Muhaysini standing over the pilot and ranting about his possible murder while wielding a large knife has the same chilling impact as any ISIS release.

'Technical malfunction': People gather around a helicopter reportedly belonging to Syrian regime forces that crashed in Jabal al-Zawiya yesterday

Al-Muhaysini's primary demand is that the Syrian regime release Abu Mus'ab as-Suri - a notorious Al Qaeda linked militant who was arrested in Pakistan in 2005 and later rendered to his homeland.

Aleppo-born As-Suri - who holds Spanish citizenship remains a wanted man in Spain on suspicion of taking part in the Islamic Jihad Organization's 1985 bombing at Madrid's El Descanso restaurant, which left 18 dead.

He is also wanted as a possible witness to the Al Qaeda-inspired  coordinated bombings on the Madrid's train system, which killed 191 people and left more than 2,000 injured in March 2004.
