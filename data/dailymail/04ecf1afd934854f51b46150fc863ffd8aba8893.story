A man was arrested after mistaking a female police officer for a stripper while in a pub with friends

A man was arrested after mistaking a female police officer for a stripper, mirroring a scene from comedy Only Fools and Horses.

Paul Harbord, 27, was in a pub in Old Shotton, County Durham, with friends after an all-day drinking session when the officer walked in to investigate their ‘rowdy’ behaviour.

After one of his friends had told him to expect ‘entertainment’, Harbord wrongly identified the officer as a stripogram, started dancing in front of her and whipped her with a bar towel, a court heard.

The man, who works as a rigger, was then arrested but refused to believe she was a real officer until they arrived at a police station.

Harbord, of Peterlee, County Durham, admitted obstructing a police officer and was given a six-month conditional discharge.

He was also told to pay £85 and a £15 victim surcharge at Peterlee Magistrates Court.

Harbord’s mistake echoes the plot of an episode of Only Fools and Horses, Dates, broadcast in 1988, in which Del Boy mistakes a female police officer for a stripper in the Nag’s Head pub.

Jaxon Taylor, mitigating, said: ‘The defendant and a large group of friends were celebrating together. Some were dressed in pyjamas, some in Christmas jumpers.

‘They consumed a quantity of alcohol throughout the day. A number of the party became rowdy.'

He added: ‘One of the defendant’s friends had suggested some entertainment had been booked for later.

‘When a lone female police officer attended he waved a beer towel from the bar in her face.

‘He honestly didn’t believe it was a 
police officer until he got to the police station. He was quite 
embarrassed by the whole situation.

‘His friends have had a good laugh at him but he realises how serious it is. It was an honest and genuine mistake.’

Harbord, a rigger, made his mishap as he drank with friends in the Black Bull, in Old Shotton, County Durham, on December 29.

Vicky Wilson, prosecuting, said: ‘He was part of a large group dressed up. At 9.30pm a female police officer arrived at the pub, following concerns that the group was rowdy.

‘Harbord shouted “look, here is one of the strippers” as he flicked a bar towel in the officers face.” Chairman of the bench David Carr described it as an ‘unfortunate affair’.
