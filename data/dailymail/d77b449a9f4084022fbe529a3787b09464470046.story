American Sniper has shattered box office records and expectations - raking in more than $110 million in four weeks - but that success is going to affect the murder trial of Chris Kyle's accused killer, according to attorneys in the case.

Former Marine Eddie Ray Routh will face court on February 11, two years after he allegedly shot Kyle dead at a Texas firing range  as he battled Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder.

Routh is pleading not guilty by reason of insanity.

While the shooting of Kyle does not feature in American Sniper, with the war drama coming to a close with footage of his funeral, Routh's attorneys the scope of the film - from the amount of people seeing it in cinemas, to the press it is receiving and Oscar nominations - will affect the outcome of the jury.

Charged with murder: Former Marine Eddie Ray Routh will face court on February 11, charged with shooting dead 'American Sniper' Chris Kyle at a Texas firing range two years ago

Shot dead: Kyle was reportedly helping Routh deal with Post Traumatic Stress Disorder

'The film will be an issue,' Routh's attorney, J. Warren St. John, told People magazine. 

'I think any case with significant publicity has an issue with picking a jury. I've had them in the past, and anything that has significant national attention makes it hard to pick a jury.' 

Jurors are picked on their impartiality, and the hope they know nothing about the case they about to hear and deliver a verdict.

In 2013, a judge issued the gag order preventing attorneys and family members and others from talking to the media, predicting widespread media coverage.

Routh's attorneys also lost a bid to have the trial moved out of Texas, where people are particularly passionate about Kyle's story, being his home state.

'Mr. Kyle is a hero in many people's eyes,' George Parnham, a Houston criminal defense attorney not associated with the case, told People.

'Due to the fact that this movie has gained intense public attention, it's doubtful that a fair jury can be selected anywhere.'

On February 2, 2013,  Routh, 26, shot dead Kyle, 38, and Kyle's friend, father-of-one, Chad Littlefield, 35, at a shooting range near Chalk Mountain, Texas.

Kyle had been trying to help Routh deal with his PTSD and had taken him to target practice. 

American Sniper is based on Kyle's autobiography of the same name.

The controversy and acclaim the picture has received cannot be measured or denied.

The Clint Eastwood-directed blasted into first place with a massive $107 million on its debut weekend at the North American box office, which was a record for a January opening.

'The movie has become a cultural phenomenon,' Dan Fellman, head of domestic distribution at Warner Bros., said of the film's  success

'It tore apart the record book and not by a little. By an enormous amount.' 

It has been nominated for six Oscars, including Best Picture and Best Actor for Bradley Cooper. 

But the film -- on its first weekend in wide release -- also triggered a heated online debate about patriotism, with documentary filmmaker Michael Moore claiming it hero-worships Kyle, while Sarah Palin said leftists were "not fit to shine Chris Kyle's combat boots."

'God bless our troops, especially our snipers,' the former Alaska governor and one-time vice-presidential nominee, a darling of the rightwing Tea Party movement, wrote on her Facebook page.
