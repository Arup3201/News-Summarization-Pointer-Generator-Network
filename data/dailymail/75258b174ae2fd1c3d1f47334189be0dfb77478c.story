A Twitter-user signposted cyber-attacks which crippled the Home Office website by flooding it with huge amounts of internet traffic, a jury has heard.  

Mark Johnson, 44, of Stoke-on-Trent, Staffordshire, is accused of encouraging the attack by the international hacking group Anonymous, which sent the Government sites into meltdown.

The prosecution say Johnson encouraged a cyber-attack on websites run by the Home Office and Home Secretary Theresa May by posting links on his Twitter page.

Johnson is alleged to have posted a link on his social media account which meant other web users could join in with the hacking attack launched by the cyber activist group Anonymous in 2012.

A court heard the Distributed Denial Of Service (DDOS) attack - where a website is flooded with traffic to make it crash - took place between June 15 and June 18, 2012.

It began when hackers Anonymous posted a video on YouTube on June 12 which announced 'Operation Theresa May' - a two-day online assault on the Home Secretary.

Johnson is accused of posting a link to the code for the attack on the Home Office on his Twitter page @mlyjohn on June 15, 2012.

The court heard his tweet has since been deleted and he told police somebody must have hacked into his account to post the link.

But the jury of 10 women and two men were told computer experts had analysed his computer and found there was no evidence of anyone accessing his device.

Johnson denies one charge of encouraging or assisting an offence under Section 3(1) of the Computer Misuse Act 1990.

Timothy Devlin, opening the prosecution case on the first day of his trial at Birmingham Crown Court, said: 'What this really is a case about is computer hacking.

'The offence was what is called a Distributed Denial Of Service. What we accuse Mr Johnson of doing is helping others to crash the Home Office computers.

'DDOS is a situation where a large number of people simultaneously make requests of a website.

The Crown alleges Johnson, of Josiah Wedgwood Street, assisted in the web attacks on both the Home Office website and the home secretary's constituency website by posting a 'malicious' weblink through his Twitter account which, when clicked, allowed a web-user to add their connection to the cyber assault.

'We say Mark Johnson published that link in his Twitter account,' said Mr Devlin.

'He was saying 'if you want to help close down the Home Office and Theresa May's website, here's the link'.'

He added: 'We say Mark Johnson published links on Twitter for people to get involved in these joint attacks.' 

Mr Devlin told the court the DDOS attack used a malicious webpage which opened connections to the Home Office page in large numbers.

He said the Government website received a message saying 'we are legion' - which is a phrase from the Bible used by Anonymous - every time someone clicked on the link for the attack.

The court heard in just under 30 minutes from 9.34pm on June 17, 2012, 8,347 connections were made to the Government site - rendering it unresponsive to users and causing it to be taken down.

The sheer weight of connections meant that an alternative 'disaster recovery' version of the site had to be put online in place of the main site, Mr Devlin told the court.

Mr Devlin added: 'It (the Home Office page) was being bombarded so quickly they had to take it down and a substitute was put on the internet with reduced functionality.

'It was there to replace the real website, normal service was resumed the following day (June 18, 2012).

'These connections, the 8,347, were made by a variety of originators of the same DDOS message being circulated.

'That means a large number of people were able to click on a connection which then sent a message to the Home Office website and that helped close it down.

'During the attack on the Home Office website, Theresa May's constituency website was also attack from links posted on Twitter. The website ceased to function.

'And what we are saying is that Mark Johnson published that link in his Twitter account.

'So what he was doing was saying if you want to help close down the Home Office and Theresa May websites then here is the link and other people look at that and click that link.

'Mr Johnson says no I didn't, it must have been somebody else using my Twitter account.

'If Mr Johnson is saying this wasn't me that posted this on my Twitter account then it must have been someone else and how did they do it because they don't have his password.

'You're going to hear evidence that on the day he was arrested all his computers were taken and they've all been examined by an expert and no malware, no Trojans or no other performance email has gone in to that account which has enabled another person to steal his password.

'So the only person who had that password was Mark Johnson.'

The court heard after police traced Mr Johnson to his home he deleted his tweet from June15 and changed his Twitter account from an open setting to a private one.

His @mlyjohn account, has a header picture showing numerous images of the infamous Guy Fawkes white mask motif used by Anonymous.

Mr Devlin explained to the trial jury at Birmingham Crown Court that Johnson does not deny supporting some of global hacking group Anonymous' campaigns.

Johnson, who wore a white shirt with a dark suit jacket, sat in the dock listening intently to proceedings. 

Jurors also heard in August 2012, two months after the Home Office attack, Johnson posted a link to an Anonymous group YouTube video regarding another cyber attack, which this time targeted the San Francisco public transport system in the United States.

The jury is next set to hear from a prosecution cyber expert, with the trial expected to last a week.
