The mystery of how a little Maltese named Reese ended up 1,800 miles from his Texas home after going missing for seven years has been solved and a struggle over his ownership has cropped up in its place.

Reese, who disappeared all those years ago, showed up on the side of a Washington State highway over the weekend before a microchip identified Dinah Miller of Tyler, Texas as his owner.

The pooch was flown back to Texas and into Miller's giddy embrace on Monday, but now the family who lost him near Tacoma has filled in Reese's years-long gap in history are desperate to have him back.

But Miller says, 'No way!' despite already having two other Maltese pups.

Mourning a loss: The Davis family says they lost Reese--the Maltese they call Harley--over the weekend, which led his original owner from over seven years ago to get the dog back

Not giving him up: Dinah Miller has two other Maltese pooches and says she won't give up Reese to the Davis family

She's also unfazed, it seems, by the tears of 2-year-old little girl from Spanaway, Washington who called the dog Harley, and her closest friend, up until this weekend.

'Harley is my daughter’s best friend. That’s her little buddy. They do everything together,' Kelli Davis told KHOU.

Davis and her family say they adopted the Maltese six years ago in Mesquite, Texas--near Dallas.

Back then, he was marked as an owner surrender and records don't show whether his microchip was ever scanned.

Best friends: Kelli Davis says Reese, or Harley as they called him for six years, should be in their home and that her 2-year-old daughter is distraught over him being gone

Legal bind: Legal experts say Reese is Miller's under the law because she owned the dog when he was microchipped

The Davis family would later relocate to Washington from Texas, which explains how Reese got so far from home.

After seeing their beloved Harley on the news, the Davis family hoped to get their dog back. No such luck, says original owner Miller.

'I don’t know what to do. We just lost a part of our family,' said Davis.

Meanwhile, legal experts say that Miller is the legal owner because she initially gave Reese his microchip.

And confident he's back home her for good, Miller says she'll be treating Reese like a king.

It's an untidy ending to a story that only days before had seemed so heartwarming. The simple, if somewhat mysterious, reunion of a pet owner and her beloved dog over seven years in the making.

'We drove, we searched,' Miller told KHOU about the day Reese went missing from a friend's home near Dallas. 'We walked, we looked over fences, we peeped everywhere we could without getting shot.'

Reese was gone and would stay that way for years. Until by what Miller believed was a miracle, he came back.

A Washington vet had scanned Reese's microchip and traced him to Miller.

'We cannot believe it, we just can't believe it,' Miller told KHOU as she anxiously awaited her old pal's arrival on a United flight to Houston alongside her daughter Tisha Reed.

'Hopefully they'll just pick up where they left off,' Reed said as Reese's plane was en route.

Once he arrived, Reed's hopes came true.

Footage shows a reunion that could not have been warmer as Reese scrambled frantically from his crate to be with Miller.

'Just to hold him again and love him for the rest of his life,' said Reed. 'I know it means a lot to my mom.'

If dogs could talk: No one knows where Reese has been for the last seven years or how she traveled 1,800 miles
