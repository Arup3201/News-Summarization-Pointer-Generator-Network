Police are investigating whether thieves targeted the home of Olympian Rebecca Adlington after being tipped off that she was out by the star's Twitter feed.

The 24-year-old swimming star revealed how she was reduced to 'absolute pieces' when she thought her Olympic medals had been stolen in the raid on her home in Romiley, Stockport, yesterday - then later described her relief after the irreplaceable items were found safe.

It has emerged that, just hours before the break-in in Stockport, Adlington had tweeted a photograph to her some 335,000 Twitter followers of her enjoying an 'amazing meal' with friends in London.

Clue? Rebecca Adlington's Stockport home was targeted by thieves hours after she tweeted a picture of herself enjoying an 'amazing meal' with friends in London

Greater Manchester Police told the Evening Standard they would be investigating the possibility burglars then targeted Adlington's property because they knew she was not at home.

The Olympian - who won two bronze 
medals at London 2012 to add to the two golds she brought home from 
Beijing in 2008 - told her Twitter followers she was 'shaking' when she learned of the burglary and that her medals were missing.

'When I
heard that they weren't there my immediate reaction was an emotional 
one as I put so much effort into winning them,' said the 24-year-old, 
whose housemate had been unable to find Adlington's medals following the
burglary.

But to Adlington's relief the medals were found untouched after police arrived to investigate the burglary yesterday.

The intruders did take Adlington's fiance Harry Needs' car keys from inside the house and escaped with his black Audi.

Writing on her website today, Miss 
Adlington said: 'Yesterday I returned home from holiday and instead of 
going home to Manchester, my fiance, Harry, and I stayed in London to 
see his family and some friends.

'The two of us live with a friend in Manchester and after midnight we 
got a phone call from him to say that our home had been broken into.

'Luckily he was not in the house when it happened, he called the police 
when he got back and discovered there had been a burglary,' Adlington wrote.

'After making 
sure he was ok, I asked if he could check to see if my medals were there
and he couldn't find them anywhere.'

The swimmer said she kept some of her medals in her house as she is regularly asked to 'show them off' at various public appearances.

Describing her panic, she said '...you can't insure Olympic medals, and although you can get them 
replaced - I'd know they weren't the originals.

'Added to this was the fact that we were a three hour drive from home 
and desperate to get home to see our house and the state it was now in,' said Adlington.

'When the police arrived, I was on the phone to them trying to figure 
out how the break-in had happened and what had been taken. Following a 
search the medals were found thankfully, but Harry's car had been taken 
along with some other electronic goods.

'As anyone who has ever been burgled knows, it's a horrible feeling, but
we're now leaving everything to the police - who have been great in 
dealing with this upsetting episode.'

The swimmer thanked fans who had contacted her to voice their concern and support, adding that 'the vast majority of people are decent human beings - unlike those who broke into my house last night'.

News of the burglary first emerged when the swimmer wrote on Twitter: 'In absolute pieces. Some b******* have broken into my house 
and stolen my Olympic medals!!!

'Something I will never be able to replace! Actually shaking.'

However, she later added: 'Medals have been found. I'm so relieved.

'They've been in house and stolen Harry's car and got keys. I'm just glad no one has got hurt.

'Thank you all for the concern. The main thing I know is were safe. Life is more precious. Xxxxx'

The swimmer found fame in the Beijing Olympics where she won gold in the 400m and 800m freestyle.

She also won bronze medals in the same events at last year's London 2012 Games.

At the beginning of this year she announced her retirement from the sport to pursue a career in broadcasting.

Police confirmed they were investigating a burglary at the swimmer's home in Romiley, Stockport.

No one was at home at the time of the break-in, Greater Manchester Police said.

A force spokesman said: 'Officers attended to find the side ground-floor window of the house had been forced open.

'A laptop and a black Audi A3 were stolen from the house. Nothing else was taken.

'Inquiries are ongoing.'
