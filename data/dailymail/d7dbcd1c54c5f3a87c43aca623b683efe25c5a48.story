A Slovenian goalkeeper was left red-faced when he was sent off for pulling down an opponent after being caught in possession attempting a Cruyff turn.

Radomlje goalkeeper Vjekoslav Andri was given his marching orders during his side's 2-0 defeat to Krka in the Slovenian top flight on Sunday when he lost the ball near the halfway line.

With his side 1-0 down at the time and chasing an equaliser with 10 minutes still to play, the advanced Andri collected a clearance as an opposition striker bared down on him.

Instead of sending the ball down-field, Andri tried to beat his man with the sort of skill we are used to seeing Manuel Neuer perform for Bayern Munich.

Neuer is the archetypal sweeper-keeper and the Germany No 1 has earned a reputation as being as good with his feet as he is with his hands.

If Neuer was indeed the inspiration behind the goalkeeper's outfield antics, Andri obviously hadn't realised  the level of technical ability needed to pull off such a skill under pressure.

As he attempted to drag the ball away from the striker with his in-step, Andri completely missed it and the forward nicked the ball away from the keeper, whose only option was to pull his opponent to the ground.

Radomlje are currently bottom of the Slovenian league and have only recorded one win in 18 games this season.
