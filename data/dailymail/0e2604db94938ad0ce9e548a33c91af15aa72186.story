Ellen DeGeneres has announced the launch of her own lifestyle brand, to include a home-and-garden range, men's and women's clothing, and even pet accessories.

The 56-year-old talk show host has called the company E.D. - her initials, and the nickname given to her by wife Portia de Rossi - and will launch with a gift-orientated capsule collection this November, just in time for the holidays. 

'I wouldn’t be doing this if I didn’t want it to be the biggest brand name that you can imagine,' she told WWD of her lofty plans.

'My goal is that people can have a beautiful house, a really comfortable house, without only being able to afford [very expensive] things,' she explains. '[The] price point will be mid-level. As far as who it's for, I think it's for anyone.'

Ellen's first collection of goods will include gift-friendly tableware, candles, home decor, pajamas and gift wrap, and will be available online and in-store at several unnamed retailers around the U.S.

The full launch will happen next spring, and carry a wider range of home and garden wares, as well as men's and women's fashion, and a pet collection.

Ellen's venture is bolstered by retail mogul Christopher Burch – ex-husband of Tory Burch, and the man responsible for helping launch her fashion empire. He describes her as the dream business partner, saying: 'Everyone responds to her - you're a man, you're a woman, you're a mom, you're a working mom - she brings a happiness and a light and a true authenticity.'

Ellen has thrown her weight behind several brands in the past, from American Express to Covergirl and JCPenney, and the self-confessed 'big animal lover' has a particular loyalty to the support of animal-rights organizations, such as PETA.

In 2011, she launched Going Vegan With Ellen, a site dedicated to her animal-friendly diet and lifestyle. She had an all-vegan wedding with Portia in 2008, and more recently, had plans to open a vegan tapas bar in Los Angeles, which ultimately fell through.

House-flipping is another of her passions. According to TMZ, Ellen recently made a whopping $15 million profit on the L.A. mansion she purchased for $40 million just six months ago, after selling it to Napster co-founder Sean Parker for $55 million.

Mr Parker reportedly 'went nuts over the famous house and Ellen's interior design,' so if this glowing report is anything to go by, E.D.'s imminent launch could well be a storming success.
