Some swear by hair of the dog, others by a strong black coffee.

But the best way to cure a hangover is to tuck into a fried breakfast, a leading researcher has claimed.

Richard Stephens, professor of psychology at Keele University, says the carbohydrates in a full English will help restore depleted sugar levels.

Speaking ahead of the annual meeting of the international Alcohol Hangover Research Group, he said the best hangover cures are those that provide glucose.

He told The Atlantic: 'One of the mechanisms of the hangover is to do with glucose metabolism and 
not having enough blood sugar.

'In Britain, one of the most prevalent 
hangover cures is a big fried breakfast - fried eggs, sausages, baked 
beans, and all the rest - that’s well-renowned as a hangover cure in 
Britain, and it probably does work because there are lot of 
carbohydrates in that meal. And that will restore depleted sugar levels.'

He admits on occasions when he has overindulged, a fried breakfast 'works wonders'.

Professor Stephens, himself a member of the Hangover Research Group, added that  anti-inflammatory drugs 
(such as ibuprofen) can also help, as can the migraine drug Tolfenamic acid and the herb borage. 

And hair of the dog? Speaking to Atlantic journalist Olga Khazan, he explained that once the ethanol in alcohol has been broken down by the body, it tackles other alcohols such as methanol, which can cause feelings of sickness.

However if you drink more, the methanol won't be broken down - the body simply goes back to processing the ethanol.

Hence why continuing to drink can stem the pain of a hangover.

A study last year revealed why we crave a fry-up when we're hungover.

Researchers at Cornell University found we are hardwired to want fat - and alcohol kills our willpower.

'All mammals gravitate to eating the most energy-dense foods,' explained David Levitsky, professor of human ecology and nutritional sciences. 'And fat is the most energy-dense food available.'

Sober, you may not give in to those cravings, but after a night of boozy indulgence, you lose such learned inhibitions as disciplined eating, Levitsky added.

And the other good news? Hangovers decline with age, he says.
