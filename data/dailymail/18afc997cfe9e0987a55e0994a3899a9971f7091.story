The police aren't renowned for their sense of humour, but someone at Surrey Police clearly had an attack of the funnies this morning when they took to Twitter.

In an effort to warn motorists of the icy conditions, a flurry of tweets from the station's official Twitter feed, were sent out in the style of rap star Vanilla Ice's 1990 hit 'Ice Ice Baby'.

The first tweet, sent out around 7am this morning read: 'Ice Ice Surrey. Alright stop, collaborate and listen, Ice is back and these roads are glistening.'

The police giving a rap on Twitter, not the knuckles: Surrey Police shows it hasn't lost its cool by rapping about road safety

Shortly followed by: 'Slowly, cuz the streets are freezin', Don't forget to clear off the windscreen.'

And finally: 'If ice is a problem, yo, you can solve it, check out this link while my DJ revolves it.'

The link referred to in the final tweet sent readers through to a Surrey Police Road Safety website, offering advice on driving in wintery conditions.

The image on the website is of a mangled car, leading some on Twitter to take offence at the police's lighthearted approach to a serious matter.

Surrey Police defended its decision to treat a serious matter with a touch of humour.

A police spokesman said: 'The #IceIceSurrey tweets were a light-hearted way of getting across a serious message about road safety during the cold weather this morning and we hope it raised a smile amongst our followers.

'We've had more than 2,000 re-tweets so far and if it gets more people thinking about how they drive in icy conditions then that's a great result.'

Certain followers of the police's twitter feed weren't convinced however.

Matt Baxter-Reynolds tweeted: 'mixed feelings about the use of Surrey Police's official twitter feed. Engagement: good. Appropriateness: ummm'

Others criticised Surrey Police for being out of touch in the choosing of a song that is 22 years out of date.

Not so funny: The link following the rap-style weather warnings led readers to this page on road safety. Some Twitter users felt the picture of the mangled wreck sat awkwardly alongside the jokey police tweets

#Unsure: Matt Baxter-Reynolds expressed uncertainty about the Surrey Police's use of humour when advising drivers how to stay safe on the roads

One said: 'This was a hit 22 years ago, so why the police think it's 
relevant to Twitter users today shows they are a bit out of touch'.

The general consensus on Twitter, however, was positive, with tweets congratulating Surrey Police on its novel approach to policing.

One user referred to the use of police humour to broadcast a serious message as 'genius', while another said it 'casts the police in a new light'.

Sadly, not all of the country's police forces are so tolerant of their officers showing their funny side on Twitter.

Popular police officer PC
Andy Hall, 38, from Greater Manchester Police, was stopped 
from using his force's social networking account this week after being accused of 
posting too many humourous and bizarre comments.

After being given responsibilty to write his messages on the social 
networking site, dubbed 'Tweets from the Beat', to encourage more locals 
to report crime, his bosses intervened when he started to stray beyond the realms of policing.

Among his random postings were song lyrics, commentary on the X Factor and gags about former pop stars.

The officer also used the account to highlight the inflated price of confectionery alongside the hashtag Â£crimeupdate, including posts saying 'Cadburys Starbar 78p!!? Maltesers 80p!!!'PC Hall would give regular weather reports and
affectionately referred to his beat of Radcliffe, near Bury, Greater 
Manchester, as 'Radders'

Community outreach: PC Hall's tweets often featured song recommendations and weather updates

Despite followers referring to him as 'a legend' and his random tweets as 'brilliant', he was relieved of the duty when he inadvertently posted a lighthearted tweet just hours after a 
fatal police pursuit in Radcliffe.

Jack Christian, 22, and Lee Perris, 
23, died after their Volkswagen Polo crashed as they were fleeing a 
police patrol on Sunday morning.

Later that day, the message 'I will 
find. I will hunt you down' was posted on the GMP Radcliffe account.

The message, however, was in response to another Twitter user and unrelated to the
tragedy.

Senior officers are thought to have spoken to PC Hall and he agreed to hand over his tweeting duties to colleague.
