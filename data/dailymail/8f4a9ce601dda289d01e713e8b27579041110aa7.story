What a difference a day makes. Only on Thursday, the country was basking in sunshine and 30C (86F) heat.

By yesterday morning, however, temperatures had plummeted as autumn arrived with a flurry of showers – and barely any part of the country managed to reach the 20C (68F) mark.

The Environment Agency last night issued its first flood warnings of the season as rain fell on ground baked hard by the long summer.

More than an inch (26mm) of rain fell 
in just six hours in Ravensworth in North Yorkshire yesterday and there 
were thundery storms and lightning in parts of the South West.

Billy Payne, a forecaster with 
MeteoGroup, said: ‘We have had some heavy rain which will continue 
overnight and into the weekend. It has been quite a contrast from 
Thursday.

The heaviest rain fell in North Yorkshire but other parts of 
the country will see 30-40mm locally over the next day or so.

‘It has been a lot cooler than on Thursday, with most parts of the country seeing temperatures drop at least 10C.

‘Most places have seen temperatures in the mid-teens, with only Norfolk rising above 20C (68F).’

The rain will push north and west into the weekend, with the South East managing some sunny spells.

The Environment Agency issued two 
flood warnings – in which flooding  is expected and residents and 
businesses are warned to take immediate action – along the North East 
coast and four  less serious flood alerts for other parts of the region.

The Met Office also issued a ‘yellow’ warning of heavy rain.

A warning on its website said: 
‘Slow-moving bands of rain will affect parts of the UK on Saturday. Some
locally heavy and persistent rainfall is expected, with the main risk 
transferring towards Northern Ireland, south-west Scotland and North 
Wales, whilst the rain should turn more showery across northern England.

‘Elsewhere there will be further heavy
showers – 20-40mm is likely to fall, locally in excess of 60mm, leading
to some flooding from rivers or surface water.’

The overall picture remains unsettled 
into next week but Mr Payne urged people not to give up hope of more hot
weather before winter arrives.

‘On October 1, 2011 the temperature reached 29.9C (85F) at Gravesend in Kent, the warmest October day on record,’ he said.

‘Looking at the next couple of  weeks,
there’s no sign of anything particularly warm, but I wouldn’t write it 
off completely yet.’
