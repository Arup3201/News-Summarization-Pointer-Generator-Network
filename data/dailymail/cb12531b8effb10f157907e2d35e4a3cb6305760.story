The identity of the man who buried a mysterious message in a bottle in a cathedral 100 years ago was today revealed as a local stonemason.

Teresa Armatage, 78, has learned it was her grandfather, William Raybole, who had penned an intriguing note in Durham Cathedral, saying: ‘This grave was opened on Sunday May 11th 1913’.

The revelation came after experts carried out a delicate operation under the media spotlight to ease the message from the bottle last Friday, as reported by MailOnline.

Discovery: Mr Raybole penned an intriguing note, saying: 'This grave was opened on Sunday May 11th 1913'

The glass vessel was unearthed days earlier by stonemason Steve Mann while relaying the flagstones near the Venerable Bede in the cathedral’s 12th century Galilee Chapel.

A faded note, written on the back of a theatre advert, carried the names Mr W Raybole, Mr W Carter and Mr G Yeoman, bracketed together with the word 'Grave' and what appears to be a capital 'D'.

Mrs Armatage said: ‘It was really emotional when I learned it was his name on the paper. We all knew him as Grandpops. He served for many years as a stonemason at the cathedral.

‘I don’t know why he would have written the note. They had probably opened a grave by mistake while carrying out work and left the message as a way of easing their consciences.

‘I recognise the handwriting, as well. It is almost identical to that of my father and his son, Jack Raybole.’

Mrs Armatage, of High Pittington, near Durham, said Mr Raybole had been involved in the historic exhumation of the remains of St Cuthbert in 1899, before they were reburied in their present place.

Mr Raybole was badly injured during a raid on Sunderland while serving with 9th Battalion The Durham Light Infantry.

Mrs Armatage said: ‘He ended up having to have his leg amputated and was fitted with a wooden leg.

‘The cathedral was extremely kind to him and the Durham Dene and Chapter Library gave him a job. He worked there until he was 80 and was a familiar sight in Durham.

Advert: Before it was opened, the only clue to what lay within was the words 'Globe Theatre', visible on the paper's letterhead. It was advertising a production of English dance and folk songsin London's West End

‘He would come out of his house in Gilesgate and walk to the old drill hall, where he would rest before going to the Market Place. He would rest again before making the final climb to the cathedral.’

'It was a delicate operation easing it out little by little'

Mrs Armatage added: ‘It would be fascinating to find out who the other men were. Perhaps they also have family still living in the area.’

The bottle was handed over to Durham University conservator Liz Brannigan, who looked on as freelance conservator Bob Elsey gently prised the cork out under a microscope last week.

Mr Elsey said: 'After five minutes the cork it started to loosen. That was the easy bit, the hard bit was the paper which had been rolled up and then folded over and inserted. It was a delicate operation easing it out little by little.'

A theatre advert - believed to be the closest piece of paper to hand when the note was made - was for a production of English dance and folk songs at the Globe Theatre, in London’s West End.

Cathedral archaeologist Norman Emery said: 'The interesting thing to the advert is that it refers to the sole lessee of the Globe Theatre as Charles Frohman, the American impresario of the day. Frohman produced J.M. Barrie's Peter Pan.'

The Globe was renamed the Gielgud Theatre in 1994 and is located on Shaftesbury Avenue.
