The University of Southern California today introduced new head basketball coach Andy Enfield, whose surprising success at the helm of Florida Gulf Coast University made him a hero of this year's NCAA Tournament.

Trojan fans are hoping he can bring 'Dunk City,' the explosive, fast-paced style of play that made tiny FGCU so successful, to their school.

He has already brought his stunning wife to the campus in Los Angeles. Amanda Marmcum Enfield, a retired model who posed for Victoria's Secret, Chanel, Armani and Maxim magazine, stood alongside her husband at the ceremony.

By his side: Enfield has said that wooing Amanda to leave the catwalks of New York to become his wife was the greatest recruiting success of his life

Enfield will reportedly see his 
salary rocket from $157,000 a year at FGCU to 'well over a million a 
year' as he takes up the head coach position at USC.

As
well standing out for his team's impressive play in the March Madness 
tournament, Enfield also captured attention with his stunning model 
wife, Amanda Marcum, who was pictured cheering him on.

USC athletic director Pat Haden told ESPN that the school had reached an agreement with Enfield; a source added that Enfield's deal is for six years.

'Those in the basketball world have known of his abilities for a while,' Haden said.

Enfield, 43, also expressed his excitement at the deal.

'In meeting with Pat Haden, I was very impressed with his vision for the men's basketball program,' he said in a statement.

'I am looking forward to bringing an exciting, up-tempo style of play to USC and building the men's basketball brand into one that the fans and basketball community will enjoy and respect.'

Great success: Enfield will reportedly make ten times his $157,000 salary at Florida Gulf Coast

Second fiddle: Enfield will have to contend with making that basketball team a major force at a school where football rules

It's somewhat of a step up for Enfield. FGCU has about 11,300 students and the team plays in a 4,500-seat arena, while USC has 37,000 students and the Trojans play at the 10,258-seat Galen Center.

He will take over from interim coach Bob Cantu, who succeeded Kevin O'Neill after he was fired in January.

The coach had a stellar record of 
41-28 in his two seasons as head coach in FGCU, leading the Eagles to 26
wins this season - a record for the school.

The underdog college also shocked the nation when they became the first 15th seed to the advance to the Sweet Sixteen stage of the NCAA tournament.

Dad's turn: Andy Enfield and his team, including player Brett Comer seen playing with Marcum, have become the unlikely Cinderella story of the NCAA tournament due to their unexpected success

Big win: Florida Gulf Coast's made its first big statement on Friday night when the little-known team beat Georgetown, one of the top-ranked teams in the tournament

They caused upset by beating  No. 2 seed Georgetown and No. 7 seed San Diego State before losing to Florida on Friday.

Throughout the games, Enfield was supported by his wife Amanda, a former model for Victoria's Secret, Armani and Chanel.

She
was seen holding their son Marcum, whose name is her maiden name, while
they watch ‘dad’ at work with his team in the Cowboys stadium in 
Arlington, Texas.

Amanda,
34, said she had 'mixed emotions' about the new wave of attention that 
she was granted in light of her husband’s success on the court.

'I
never expected this. I'm flattered, and I think it's great, but it's 
also kind of crazy to me,' she said in an interview with USA Today. 'I guess it's kind of cool but it's still a bit surreal to me.

Luxury: The couple will be moving out of their Fort Myers, Florida home, pictured, to take up the job

Stunning: He had tried to sell the home before his team's impressive run in the NCAA tournament

Moving up: But with his salary increasing by 10 times, he will have no problem finding something new

'I just don't think I should be the 
focus at all. The team is the biggest story. The best part is seeing 
Andy and the players have their dreams actually come true. They are so 
happy.'

Instead she is happy staying a full-time mom to her three children: daughters Aila, 6, and Lily, 5, with son Marcum turning 2 next month.

Basketball has had an integral role in the couple’s relationship, as they met at a regional tournament when her native Oklahoma State team was playing in New York and he was passing through town with a mutual friend on the way to a NCAA tournament.

He proposed by hiding the engagement ring in a box of Krispy Kreme donuts, and the rest is history.

'She was still in the prime of her 
modelling career. For her to give up that to be a coach's wife and have 
children is something in itself. She is an amazing (mother),' Enfield 
said of his wife.

She is just one of the reasons why the team is getting an unexpected amount of attention in this year’s March Madness.

They shocked the nation by staging two massive upsets- beating Georgetown and San Diego State- in the NCAA men's basketball tournament and becoming the first 15-seed team ever to reach the Sweet Sixteen round.

In addition to their basketball skills, the team has earned themselves a spot as fan favorites with on the court antics that include dunks, laughs, and now a coordinated dance.

Work hard, play hard: FGCU players douse their coach with water in the locker room after their spectacular victory

Enfield said his key to victory has always been a work hard-play hard mentality.

'We
don't take ourselves too seriously,' said Florida Gulf Coast coach Andy
Enfield, whose players tossed him in the air and doused him with water 
in a raucous celebration before his postgame interviews.

'We try to have fun, get serious when we have to. Our goal was to make history and we did it.'
