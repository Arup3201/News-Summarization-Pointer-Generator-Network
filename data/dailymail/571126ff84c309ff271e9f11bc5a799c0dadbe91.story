Flying Dutchman: Van Persie equalised for Holland with the effort in their Group B 5-1 win on Friday

Known as "#persieing" the action for which the Manchester United forward scored has been replicated by fans eager to reinact the 'Flying Dutchman' strike.

The trend has become so popular that even the Holland captain's granddad Wim Ras has joined the craze - with the 93-year-old impersonating his grandson.

'A belly landing is not always fun, huh? I used to do gymnastics and I know what it is like but in gnymnastics those moves are planned and intended,' Ras said of Van Persie's equaliser in Salvador's Arena Fonte Nova.

'Robin only needed a fraction of a second to make the jump and to get such an exquisite delivery in such a situation and then to score, that is a hell of an achievement.

'The attack went well but getting up there was very difficult, obviously, because it is not a movement that you do every day.'

The Dutch face Australia in their second Group B match on Wednesday with Holland fans hoping for a similar performance from their skipper against the Socceroos in Porto Alegre's Estadio Beira-Rio.
