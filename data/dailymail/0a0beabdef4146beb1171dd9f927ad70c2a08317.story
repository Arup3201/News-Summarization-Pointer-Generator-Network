Beneath hundreds of thousands of glittering fairylights each carriage showcases the store’s most sought-after and luxurious fashion, accessories and homewares.

The glamorous scenes include a luxurious piano bar and dinner party with exquisite designer evening gowns, luxe jewellery, bespoke children's toys and deluxe luggage dotted throughout.

It took a team of 50 people over 500 hours to create the installation, led by Mark Briggs, Store Image Director and Sarah Southgate, Head of Window Design.

As well as 60 huge Christmas trees the display features a breathtaking £80,000 gown by Ralph & Russo, as well as some more affordable baubles at £3.95.

Each window is framed by twinkling hedgerows and the store’s famous facade will feature two dazzling 30-foot Christmas trees, making the spectacle a great festive photo backdrop.

To coincide with the launch of the windows, Harrods.com has unveiled its Christmas homepage, which also features a scene from the steam train.

A Harrods spokesman said: 'Each year we aim to deliver unique Christmas windows which will enthrall and inspire our visitors from around the world.

'The Harrods Express is a captivating concept which enables us to take our customers on a compelling festive journey, where each "carriage" window beautifully showcases the store’s stunning and unrivalled offering of luxury fashion, accessories, homewares and special Christmas gifts.'

This weekend also marked the official opening of the Harrods Grotto, with the arrival of Father Christmas as part of the annual Christmas Parade.
