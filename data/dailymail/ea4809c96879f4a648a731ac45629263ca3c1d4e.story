Police have arrested a 21-year-old man over the fire that destroyed the 140-year-old Reeves furniture store in Croydon at the height of the riots.

House of Reeves has stood on the same corner for more than a century but was targeted by rioters as violence spread across the capital on Monday evening.

Flames ripped through the historic building and spread to neighbouring businesses as firemen battled desperately to quell the inferno.

But it is now likely that the damage which was 'worse than the blitz' would force the ravaged building to be demolished and rebuilt.

As London cleans up after the riots, an internet group has been set up with people pledging to donate Â£10 to help Reeves rebuild their shop. This afternoon 81 people had offered to give money. However, the donations will only be handed over if 1,000 people contribute.

The owners of the family 
furniture store were devastated after seeing the charmed remains 
of the building that fell victim to the riots last night.

Owner
Trevor Reeves said: 'It has just provided (for) my family and the 15 or
20 staff and families that were supported, it's just completely 
destroyed.

'Words fail me. It's just gone, it's five generations. My father is distraught at the moment. It's just mindless thuggery.'

His brother Graham told Sky News: 'Our lives are destroyed, it will probably be someone else next week. It's horrendous, 35 years I have been down here.'

He
said the business was established in 1867, but he now had 'nothing', 
adding: 'Everything is just gone, we have just got nothing left.

'I was in the Brixton riots but this is worse. My life is destroyed.'

One eye witness said: 'The building has survived the test of time. The damage last night was worse than the blitz.

'The area was known for the Reeves furniture store, and that part of the street had been named Reeves Corner.'

The escalating disorder in London began in Tottenham on Saturday evening. The iconic Carpetright building which had also survived the ravages of war and time was destroyed.

Last night saw violence flare across the capital with Croyden being one of the worst towns to be hit.

A man was rushed to hospital with life-threatening injuries after being shot during the chaos.

Police struggled to contain the 
chaos as hooded youths tore through the region smashing anything in 
their path and hurling bricks, petrol bombs and missiles into the air.

Croydon Central MP Gavin Barwell 
said: 'I'm sickened to see this happening in my town. My first instinct 
is sympathy for the businesses and residents who have been directly 
affected by what's happened.

'The
main building which was seen on fire at Reeves Corner is a family 
business called Reeves, which has been there for a century, and it's 
been completely destroyed.

'The people responsible for this wanton violence need to be brought to justice.'

Mr
Barwell, who has lived in Croydon all his life, said he was trying to 
speak to the Home Secretary to urgently discuss police resources.

He
said: 'The Met Police and fire brigade need to be given resources from 
other parts of the country to make sure that another night of this 
violence does not take place.'

Such a waste: The carpet store and apartment complex that was burned down in Tottenham on the first night of rioting was also a Victorian era building that had survived the war

Several blazes were seen across Croydon, with plumes of smoke rising from the buildings, prompting outrage from local residents.

Pub landlord Alan McCabe told the BBC: 'I have never seen such a disregard for human life. I hope they rot in hell.

'The grief they have caused people, the fear they have put in people's hearts, decent people who have done nothing to anyone.'

Simon Hoar, cabinet member for community safety at Croydon Council, said: 'It is an absolute disgrace. It has nothing to do with any issues these people have. These are pure common thieves more interested in getting a free telly.'

Mike Fisher, leader of Croydon Council, said: 'I am disgusted by the mindless hooliganism displayed by the criminal element that has come to Croydon.

'Businesses that have been around in Croydon for more than 100 years have been destroyed just because these morons think it is all right.

'The council will do all that it can to assist the police in bringing these people to book. It is simply not acceptable.'
