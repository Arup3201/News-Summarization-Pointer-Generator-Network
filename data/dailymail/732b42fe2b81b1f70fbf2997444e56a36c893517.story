A three-year-old boy caused thousands of pounds' worth of damage after setting fire to his family home.

Dontay Mosley crept downstairs in the family home, picked up a gas oven lighter and set fire to the carpet.

His mother's partner Joseph Perkins realised what had happened after smelling smoke.

He dashed downstairs, but was forced back by the flames.

Dontay's mother Milly managed to grab her son and escape from the house with Joseph and one of their pet cats.

But their other cat, Fluffy, and dog Boss, were both overcome by smoke inhalation.

Firefighters saved the dog by giving it oxygen but could not revive the cat.

The blaze destroyed all of the family's possessions - including Dontay's fourth birthday presents.

Milly, 24, said: 'We have lost everything but we are all very lucky to be alive.

'We were in bed asleep when my partner woke up and said he could smell smoke so we both ran downstairs - but the fire blew Joseph backwards.

'I got my son and got out. He was 
just sat in the kitchen eating his cereal as he didn't realise what he 
had done. He didn't mean to kill the cat - it was an accident.

The fire, which was started by the three-year-old, caused thousands of pounds of damage

'He has done things like this before so I put the lighter up high. He must have managed to get it.

'He doesn't understand. I took him back to the house to show him the damage and that upset him.

'Now he's having lessons at the fire station - we're very lucky that he shut the door.'

The blaze started at about 7.30am on Saturday at the house in Derby.

After evacuating the house, dog Boss amazingly went back into the house to look for Milly's daughter, Destiny Thomas, six.

Milly added: 'She wasn't there but Boss didn't know that - I think he was making sure she was safe.'

Boss then collapsed from smoke inhalation but firefighters revived him outside by giving him oxygen.

Crews managed to contain the blaze in the room but the rest of the house was severely damaged by smoke.

The family were last night staying with relatives but Milly said she had contacted the council about emergency accommodation.

She said their private rented home had not been fitted with smoke alarms.Milly's sister, Nicola, said the family had lost everything but were comforted by the kindness of strangers who had donated goods.

She said she posted a message on social networking website Facebook telling people about her sister's situation.

And that within hours people and supermarkets had turned up at her house to donate items.

She said: 'These are people we do not even know - they have been so kind. We just wanted to say thank you for everything.

'Dontay didn't know what he was doing. He is very quiet and just sneaked downstairs.'
