National Zoo giant panda cub Bao Bao (bow-bow) has ventured outside for the first time.

The zoo says Bao Bao spent about two hours outside Tuesday with mother Mei Xiang's.

The zoo says Bao Bao tried out her climbing skills on one of the smaller trees and sat on the grass with a piece of bamboo.

Bao Bao soon grabbed some bamboo for herself, sitting beside her mom in the sunny yard. Zoo officials say Bao Bao has started tasting bamboo, but she's still nursing from Mei Xiang

Cub love: Bao Bao, who was born last August and is pictured her in January, is only the second cub to survive at the zoo since the first giant panda was brought in the 70s

Zookeepers had said Monday that Bao Bao would have the option of going outside if the temperature was at least 35 degrees and it wasn't not raining or snowing.

Animal keepers 'cub-proofed' the panda yards before allowing Bao Bao outside.

They placed collars on trees to prevent the cub from climbing too high.

Some tree limbs have been trimmed, and the keepers spread out bales of hay to cushion any falls.

The Smithsonian's National Zoo is naming its female giant panda cub Bao Bao after receiving more than 123,000 votes from the public.

Bao Bao, which means 'treasure' or 'precious', is only the second surviving cub born at the National Zoo since the first pandas arrived in 1972 to commemorate President Richard Nixon's historic visit to China.

She was born August 23, 2013.

Mei Xiang's only other surviving cub, a male named Tai Shan, was born in 2005 and was returned to China in 2010 for breeding. Male panda Tian Tian is the father of both cubs.Â
