A prankster has brought smiles - and confusion - to the faces of unsuspecting New Yorkers by giving them high fives as they hail cabs.

Meir Kalmanson, who filmed himself undertaking the daring feat, said he had long seen people stretching out their hands in a bid to flag down taxis in the city - and often felt sorry for them.

'There's just tons of people raising their hands and there’s nothing going on around them,' the 24-year-old filmmaker told DNAinfo. 'They seemed so alone and I wanted to give them a high five.'

So he decided to brighten up their days by letting them know they were not alone - and two of his friends filmed him while he high fived strangers around Bryant Park.

Brightening their days: The woman whoops with delight after realizing she's been part of a prank

Going for it: He said he hoped the video would encourage New Yorkers to stop being so intense

The video, which was shared to YouTube, shows him prancing across sidewalks to reach commuters as they wait for cabs. After slapping their hands, he runs off.

'I wouldn't look back,' he said. 

Some see him coming and quickly yank their hands away, certain that he can't be trusted. One man looks over his shoulder to stare at him in shock as he flees.

But others appreciate the gesture, bursting into laughter as he jumps in the air to smack their hands. 

Undeterred: Kalmanson said some people were in a rush but no one was left annoyed by his plan

New heights: On the video, which has been viewed 240,000 times, he gets more and more ridiculous

Uncertain: One man gives the prankster a bemused look over his shoulder as Kalmanson runs away

He admitted to DNAinfo that he didn't get any abuse from anyone, but did get people laughing. 

After filming his escapades, he shared the video on his YouTube page, AMK Productions. By Wednesday afternoon it had been viewed more than 240,000 times.

He said that he hopes the video will encourage New Yorkers to 'stop being so intense'.  

Last year, he filmed 'Sleeping On Strangers On The Subway' in which he pretended to fall asleep on people sitting next to him on the train. That video has around 1.5 million views.
