Karaoke fans rejected the traditional sentiments of Auld Lang Syne this New Year and saw in 2013 Gangnam Style, according to a new poll.

The K-Pop rapper Psy's worldwide hit single topped a chart to find the most sung song in the UK on New Year's Eve.

It accounted for almost a quarter (23 per cent) of the 100,000 songs sung on Monday on Karaoke firm Lucky Voice's online service.

It pushed the traditional favourite, based on a poem by Scottish poet Robert Burns, off the top spot for the first time since 2005.

Other popular choices included Adele's Someone Like You and Call Me Maybe by Carly Rae Jepsen.

The firm's boss Nick Thistleton said: 'Auld Lang Syne has always, without fail, been the people's choice to celebrate the start of the New Year.

'Since we started recording the UK karaoke charts, no song has come close to taking the number one spot.

'Yet since we added Gangnam Style to our catalogue of over 8,000 songs at the end of last year we have seen it quickly become an established karaoke favourite.

'It would have been great to be a fly on the wall at the thousands of house parties across the UK to see so many people getting involved - singing and dancing along around their laptops.'
