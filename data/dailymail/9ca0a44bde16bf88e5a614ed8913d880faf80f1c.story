Paulie Malignaggi would relish a crack at Kell Brook’s world title as the former champion agonises over whether to make his ring return.

The New Yorker has been out of action since last April after losing his challenge for Shawn Porter’s IBF welterweight crown.

Porter then lost to Sheffield’s Brook in Los Angeles in August and Malignaggi would welcome a return to Britain.

Malignaggi has not fought since last April but would relish a shot at the current IBF welterweight champion 

The 34-year-old fought Lovemore N’dou in Manchester in 2008 and will be back in the city later this month as part of a Las Vegas-themed boxing night.

And he told Sportsmail: ‘I can’t figure out what I want to do, I think I’ll figure it out in the new year. I’m coming over to Manchester for this event and one of the things I’ve always wanted is to come back and fight in the UK.

‘The fans always made me feel appreciated. Being part of this event in Manchester will go a long way to making me search deep inside me and remind me of the appreciation in the UK.

‘I think it will be a great event and to be invited is humbling. If I see that kind of appreciation then who knows. I have been thinking some days that I want to fight in the UK.

‘Kell Brook has a world title so he interests any top welterweight. Who wouldn’t fancy a chance to win a world title?

‘Kell’s done a great job coming up the ranks and won the world title in magnificent fashion. It’s certainly his moment to shine but an opportunity to win a world title is one I don’t think anyone would turn down.’

Paulie Malignaggi will be attending the ‘Vegas Fight Night Comes To Manchester Event’ along with many other top names from the boxing, sport and entertainment world on January 31 at Event City. For more info on tickets please go to www.mcrsportsandentertainment.com
