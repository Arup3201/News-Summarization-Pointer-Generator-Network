An ancient tomb dubbed Cornwall’s answer to Stonehenge is to be rebuilt 5,000 years after it was first constructed by early man.

Carwynnen Quoit (a term for a giant tomb) - known as ‘The Giant's Quoit’ - marked a macabre mass burial site used between 4,000BC and 2,300BC.

The stone structure, set in five acres of farmland, was originally built on top of a huge tomb thought to contain the remains of Neolithic men.

The 'Giant's Quoit' before it collapsed in the 1960's. An ancient tomb dubbed Cornwall's answer to Stonehenge it is to be rebuilt.

Carwynnen is one of around 12 megalithic tombs, or quoits, that survive in Cornwall.

It is believed quoits were built as tombs for complete bodies and when the one at West Lanyon collapsed two centuries ago excavation revealed a number of skeletons.

Some archaeologists believe the structures were left partially open and  bones were removed and returned.

It was later used by the Victorians for picnics and was a meeting place for members of the traditional Celtic religion.

But the Stonehenge-like structure collapsed in 1834 and was rebuilt but then fell again in 1967 following an earth tremor.

Officials at The Sustainable Trust and English Heritage are now planning to rebuild the structure which lies in Troon, Cornwall.

Pip Richards, trust director, said they have begun a dig at the site and want to turn it into a tourist attraction like Stonehenge.

She said: 'It’s such a waste for these stones to just lie on the floor.

'English Heritage will need to be satisfied that the monument will stand for 100 years before permission to proceed is granted, but we are confident.

'The dig is helping show us where the stones would have originally stood

'So far we have found shards of pre-historic pottery and a green stone pestle or axe-head.'

The capstone is 3.3m long, 2.5m wide and 0.3m thick and would originally have had a covering of earth.
