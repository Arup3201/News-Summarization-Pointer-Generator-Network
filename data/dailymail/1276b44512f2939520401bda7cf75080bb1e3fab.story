Suki Waterhouse looks the epitome of laid-back chic in the new Superga campaign.

Following in the footsteps of fellow British stars Alexa Chung and Rita Ora, Suki shows off the Italian plimsoll in a variety of vintage-inspired shots.

Encapsulating the brand’s concept of 'Sprezzatura' - the Italian art of looking good without trying - Suki is seen leaning in an open doorway in one shot, wearing a cream shift dress and holding a pair of Superga trainers.

As the latest face of Superga, Suki certainly encapsulates the brand's concept of Sprezzatura, the Italian art of looking good without trying

Also modeled by Suki, as she sits aside a traditional Italian Vespa, are a pair of pink trainers which are the result of collaboration between Superga and the charity Fashion targets breast cancer

Another image sees Suki with the same pale lips and heavy eye make-up curled up in a deck chair by a pool.

Her fresh-faced doe-eyed look, coupled with lashings of sex appeal works perfectly against the retro Italian backdrop.

If you're feeling charitable, check out the cute pink trainers, which are the result of collaboration between Superga and the charity Fashion targets breast cancer.

At least 30 per cent of the sale of the stylish summery shoes will go to the charity's invaluable work.

Currently also the face of Burberry Brit Rhythm, the 22-year-old model-turned-actress has rocketed to fame, not least because of her high-profile romance with Hollywood star Bradley Cooper. The gorgeous couple whom started dating in February 2013 after meeting at the Elle Style Awards in London.

She has been seen out and about recently in LA and has been tweeting her excitement over upcoming work projects.

'Welcome to my salad bed': The  22-year-old model is consuming all things green and healthy at the moment, posting snaps of her ensconced in bed beside a tray brimming with salad and vegetables

No doubt part of her enviable glow in the Superga campaign can be put down in part to her having embraced the LA ‘green’ lifestyle’.

The model recently shared a picture of herself in bed surrounded in white cotton sheets and puffy pillows, the grainy image, entitled 'welcome to my salad bed,' shows her tucking into plates of green leafy vegetables, chopped carrots, cucumber and a cup of black coffee with her dog looking on.
