Waiting for decision: Some foster parents are cannot make a decision on whether their child goes on a school trip or stay at a friend's house

Children in foster care are being prevented from having haircuts and going on school trips because of excessive council red tape, a study has found.

Thousands of foster children suffer because carers have to check with social workers before making basic decisions about their lives.

Research by the Fostering Network found that one carer in five was not allowed to take a child to get their hair cut without seeking permission.

A third were not allowed to give permission for a child to stay over with a friend. And 17 per cent, or almost one in five, could not allow a child to go on a school trip.

Others described how they could not even get permision to take foster children on family holidays with them.

One parent was banned from allowing her foster daughter to go on a school trip because she could come into contact with animals.

She said: ‘My foster daughter Jane had to miss a school trip to a local farm because the local authority wouldn’t sign the consent form because there would be animals there.

'This meant that Jane had to stay at school on her own because all the other children in the class got permission.’

Another carer revealed how red tape had led to his child being bullied.

‘She came home from school crying because she didn’t know whether she would be able to go on a school trip when all of her friends could.

‘It is hard enough being in care without being made to feel different from your friends,’ he said.

Another foster carer described how her child had lost friends because the council asked for police vetting before they would allow a sleepover.

Missing out: Foster children often miss out and are bullied because of the delay for local authorities to make a decision on whether to give permission for them to attend outings, a study has found

Needs to change: Robert Tapsfield, chief executive at The Fostering Network says there 'needs to be a change in culture within the system'

She said: ‘The local authority wanted
to run police checks on the family of our foster daughter’s friend who 
she wanted to have a sleepover with.

‘This meant that her whole family 
found out that our foster child was  in care and they decided they 
didn’t want her to see their daughter any more.’

The Fostering Network quizzed more than 1,000 carers for its ‘Like Everyone Else’ report.

Despite government pledges to tear up
red tape, 59 per cent of foster carers said it had stayed the same or 
got worse since 2010.

Robert Tapsfield, chief executive at 
the Fostering Network, said: ‘We hear far too many examples of children 
missing out on the essential experiences of childhood because their 
foster carers are not allowed to make basic decisions.

‘One girl wanted to go on a school 
trip, but because it took 16 weeks for the local authority to give 
permission she couldn’t go. That is ridiculous and the system has to 
change.’

He added: ‘The system trusts foster 
carers to provide some very vulnerable children with a safe and stable 
home, but it doesn’t trust them to get their hair cut.

‘Foster carers make these types of 
decisions for their own children all the time and they feel undervalued 
and undermined when they can’t do the same for fostered children.’

A Department for Education spokesman 
said: ‘The Government is currently consulting on proposals that make it 
clear that foster carers should be given the power to take day-to-day 
decisions about the children in their care.’

There are more than 59,000 children 
living with 45,000 foster families across the UK. But a further 8,750 
children are in need of a foster home.
