As Nicola Cortese slalomed his way 
across the ski runs in the exclusive mountain resort of Lech over New Year, Southampton's executive chairman knew it would be all downhill.

In
 his path was Katharina Liebherr, the heiress to the £3billion 
fortune left to her on trust by her father Markus after his sudden death in August 2010.

The
 story has picked up speed since his return, gathering momentum as 
Liebherr's daughter continued with her bid for power behind the scenes 
at St Mary's.

Meet the boss: Katharina Liebherr leaving St Mary's Stadium after visiting the ground on Thursday

In the driving seat: The interference from Liebherr led to Nicola Cortese's resignation from the club

In charge: Katharina Lieberr, the new non-executive chairman of Southampton

End of an era: The club have accepted the resignation of Nicola Cortese

July 2009 Swiss businessman Markus Liebherr buys Southampton for a reported £14million.

August 2009 Liebherr appoints Italian Nicola Cortese, the man who brokered the deal, as new executive chairman.

March 2010 Manager Alan Pardew guides Southampton to the Johnstone’s Paint Trophy — their first silverware since the FA Cup in 1976.

May 2010 Club
 finish seventh in League One despite a  10-point deduction for going 
into administration, narrowly missing out on the play-offs.

August 2010 Liebherr dies of a heart attack. Daughter Katharina takes over ownership of  the club.

August 2010 Cortese controversially sacks Pardew two weeks into the season.

September 2010 Nigel Adkins is handed a three-year deal to replace Pardew as manager.

May 2011Southampton gain automatic promotion to the Championship.

May 2012 Club reach the Premier League after successive promotions.

January 2013 Cortese upsets fans by axeing Adkins and bringing in little known Mauricio Pochettino from Argentina.

May 2013 Southampton finish 14th in the league, with fans pleased by Pochettino’s progress.

August 2013 Club are tipped for a strong season after spending £30m in the summer.

January 2014 Cortese resigns and Katharina Liebherr takes over as chairman, putting Pochettino’s position at the club in the balance.

On Wednesday night, just after 7pm she won, but the fear is that Southampton will be the biggest losers.

Cortese had tolerated Katharina until she refused to allow him to continue in his executive role without interference.

The Italian, a banker by profession, established The Southampton Way when Markus Liebherr took the club out of administration in 2009. He lived and breathed Southampton.

Each day, when he walked up the main staircase at St Mary's and headed towards his office suite, he passed a mural on the wall which reminded his staff of their ambition.

Katharina, who has no experience of running a football club and until recently had little interest in the sport, will run the show from now on.

Katharina has been in London this week, spending much of her
time in the offices of her lawyers Allen & Overy.

She will be non-executive chairman of the
 club and intends to appoint a chief executive to handle Southampton's 
affairs. The transition will not be easy. 

Southampton are a 
thriving Premier League club, the good news story as a succession of 
homegrown players make their way into the first team.

One of Southampton’s academy recruits is Cortese’s son,
while his wife is also heavily involved in some of the club’s community
projects.

This week's 
events have been bubbling since last summer, when Katharina arrived 
unexpectedly at the club's pre-season training camp in the stunning 
Alpine setting of Velden, Austria.

It was on the banks of Lake 
Worthersee, on the decking of the Seespitz Restaurant on the evening of 
Wednesday July 24, that she made her first serious demands to be 
involved in the day-to-day running of the club.

Until that moment
 Cortese had held her at arm's length as he went about the business of 
establishing Southampton as a force again in the Barclays Premier 
League.

It was Cortese who decided to fire Alan Pardew in August 2010 and replace him with Nigel Adkins. 

Southampton
 won two successive promotions before Mauricio Pochettino, who was 
discovered by Cortese during a scouting mission to Espanyol for a player
 two years ago, was brought in on January 18 last year.

Between 
them they convinced raw academy graduates such as Luke Shaw, Calum 
Chambers and James Ward-Prowse to remain at Southampton, even when they 
had better offers elsewhere.

Home is where the heart is: Cortese's 'Southampton way' was epitomised by club captain Adam Lallana

Uncertain future: Manager Mauricio Pochettino is ready to leave Southampton

There is a commitment to developing 
homegrown talent, something Cortese believes is his responsibility to 
English football and the national team. All that is now in jeopardy.

At
 the club's Marchwood training centre, the elaborate plans for a world 
class facility for the game's top players is coming together at 
breathtaking speed.

Soon there will be a hotel for the players to
 stay in when they return from long away trips to avoid disturbing their
 families at 3am when they return home.

Before the
 team bus arrives at the appointed hotel for away games, Southampton 
staff have already been into the rooms to vacuum them to reduce the risk
 of infection. 

Each player has his own mattress, which is 
taken to the team hotel the night before the team arrives. It is this 
stunning attention to detail which separates Cortese and the team he has
 assembled at St Mary's. They are an ambitious bunch.

This is Cortese's vision, something he aspired to when he arrived at Southampton following the Liebherr takeover in 2009.

The
 Italian believed he owed it to Liebherr to restructure the club and 
fulfill his ambition to bring Champions League football to the south 
coast for the first time. 

The executive chairman knows that it 
is a highly ambitious target and yet the players who signed last summer -
 Victor Wanyama and Dejan Lovren - were convinced they could do it.

On Wednesday morning many of the players were openly threatening to walk away from 
the club when they realised Cortese was about to quit.

Many of them have close relationships with the Italian and they exchange regular text messages with the team.

On Wednesday night, Cortese got the message loud and clear.

James Coney, Money Mail editor and lifelong Southampton fan gives his
 view on his club after chairman Nicola Cortese resigned on Wednesday.

Many Saints fans will be thinking one thing: here we go again.

For
 years, fans endured boardroom rows as the chairmanship of the club 
swapped hands. The football was bad – and the management of the club 
even worse.

After years of teetering on the brink finally Southampton sunk in to  League One and administration.

Marcus
 Liebherr was the saviour of the Saints. He not only rescued the club 
financially, but built a plan, and put leadership in place to deliver 
the club back to the top flight.

It may have taken a while for fans to
 warm to Nicola Cortese (and many, including me, were outraged when he 
ousted former manager Nigel Adkins, pictured right). But every decision he has made has 
later proved to be right – he was a capable and much envied chairman. 
Fans have even started dreaming of trophies and European football.

And it’s not just on-field success that Saints fans have had to come to terms with – but a reputation of being a well-run club.

When
 Liebherr passed away suddenly in 2010 – just a few years in to his 
takeover – all Saints fans feared that the funding and plans he put in 
place would die with him.

After all, how much could the family of this Swiss billionaire really care about some small team on the south coast of England?

Typically,
 just as things were starting to look rosy for the Saints, a new 
boardroom row looks set to tear apart everything that has been built.

With
 Cortese gone, Mauricio Pochettino will surely follow. And after that, 
who next? Lallana, Shaw, Lovren, Osvaldo, Schneiderlin? All are envied 
by others in the top flight.

A club that seemed upwardly mobile, has sunk its fans in to the depths of despair again.
