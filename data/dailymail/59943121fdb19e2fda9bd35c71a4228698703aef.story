If someone says she's over the hill they must be referring to Edythe Kirchmaier's accelerating car, as the young-at-heart 105-year-old has just passed her driving test.

The great-grandmother of 17 from Santa Barbara, who also holds the record for being the oldest person on Facebook, is not slowing down despite her advancing years.

She has been officially declared the oldest driver in California after passing her test to renew her license on Wednesday - which she described as a 'snap'.

Putting her foot down: Determined Edythe Kirchmaier refuses to give up driving despite her age. The 105-year-old renewed her license the day after her birthday on Wednesday keeping it valid until 2017

A long journey: Edythe Kirchmaier started driving in a Model A Ford 
Coupe, pictured, and now drives a Dodge Caravan, below. The Santa Barbara 
great-grandmother said: 'I couldn't imagine myself without a car'

Modern woman: As well as being one of the country's oldest drivers Edythe Kirchmaier also holds the record as the oldest member of Facebook

Speaking on the Ellen DeGeneres show, to mark her 105th birthday on Tuesday, she said: 'I'm the oldest living driver in California and maybe the United States. I do have a secret - but if I tell it it won't be a secret.'

Mrs Kirchmaier has competition in the oldest driver stakes. Verna Traux from Parksberg, Iowa, was declared the world's oldest driver at 105 in 2010 and drove until her death the following year.

But national record or not, one thing that is for sure is that Mrs Kirchmaier must have one of the best safety records for operating a vehicle.

The charity volunteer, who started driving back in 1927 in a Model A Ford Coupe, has never been in an accident or so much as received a parking ticket in her 86 years behind the wheel. 

The roads, let alone petrol prices, may have changed a lot but there was no way she was going to give up her independence.

Keep positive: Edythe Kirchmaier, left, said the secret to her record breaking life was to remain upbeat, happy and laid back. She loves her 'wonderful family' right

Happy marriage: Edythe Kirchmaier was married to her husband Joseph for 70 years before he died in 2008 at the age of 1998. The couple has two children, 6 grandchildren and 17 great-grandchildren

'When I learned to drive, there were no rules of the road,' she told Fox News. 'The roads were narrow and there were no signs saying 55 mph or anything like that.'

'I think I’m a pretty good driver. I feel safe about getting my driver's license renewed because I’ve never had an accident.'

'I just couldn't imagine myself without a car. It just didn't feel very good.'

Mrs Kirchmaier moved to California with her husband Joseph. They were married for 70 years until he died in 2008 at the age of 98. She still volunteers for Direct Relief International, a charity she has given her time to for 40 years.

Mrs Kirchmaier now drives a 1997 Dodge Caravan and her license is valid until 2017. 

Coming close to revealing the reason for her healthy age she said she had always been positive. 

'I've always been very happy,' she told the Ellen show. 'I had a happy marriage and have a wonderful family. I stay positive. If something happens and I can't do anything about it - I don't worry about it.'
