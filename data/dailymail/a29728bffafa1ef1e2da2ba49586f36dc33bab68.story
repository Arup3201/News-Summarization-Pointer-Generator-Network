Run-down and left to the elements, these abandoned buildings offer a sometimes macabre, often poignant insight into their history - as a leper colony.

The centuries-old institution on the Greek island of Chios once housed dozens of outcasts who had contracted the disease, which is still often misunderstood today.

These evocative photos by Kelly Katsarou vividly reveal the environment in which the lepers were forced to live out their lives.

Welcoming? The gates to the leper colony situated on the Greek island of Chios

Cruel: But parts of the archaic colony can also be unexpectedly beautiful, as these pictures show

Isolated: The building is shut off from the rest of the island to prevent the infection spreading

Left to suffer: This woman shows the affects of 
leprosy to her hands and face. Greek leper colonies are the subject of

Leprosy, also known as Hansen's disease after physician Gerhard Armauer Hansen, is a chronic disease caused by the bacteria Mycobacterium leprae and Mycobacterium lepromatosis.

Left untreated, the disease can cause permanent damage to the skin, nerves, limbs and eyes.

A common myth is that body parts can fall off, but it can cause limbs to become numb or diseased from secondary infections.

Although the form of transmission remains uncertain, it is thought to be through respiratory droplets.

The World Health Organization estimated that in 1995 between two and three million people were permanently disabled because of leprosy.

In the past 20 years, 15 million people have been cured of leprosy worldwide.

The colony, called Lovokomeio, opened in 1378 as the first leper colony in Greece and one of the first in all of Europe.

It
was intended to isolate those suffering from leprosy and other 
contagious skin diseases from the rest of society in order to avoid 
infecting others.

The origins of leprosy, now known to be caused by a bacterium, were then unknown, adding to the stigma placed on its sufferers.

As the disease was so poorly understood, many of the 'lepers' sent to the colony did not even suffer from it - rather, they had other skin diseases or fungal infections.

Such was the fear and stigma, settlements were usually built in 
isolated locations such as islands.

Sometimes, however, they 
were deliberately set up to be accessible so that they were kept in the public eye, and thus received a steady flow of 
donations.

Lovokomeio was no such colony. Fitting with the commonly held belief of the time that the disease was a punishment from God, there was a church dedicated to St Lazarus, the patron saint of lepers.

Picturesque: Some of the photographs make you forget the sinister past of the buildings

Eerie: Other images bring home the horror of what used to happen at the institution

Outdated: Lepers were made to live with one another and forbidden from mixing with their families

It is just one of the run-down buildings on the colony photographed by Kelly Katsarou, where childrenâ€™s
notebooks and medicines lie scattered alongside open tombs.

Doors are smashed, stripped beds lie 
rusting, and rotting floorboards give an ominous creak whenever someone 
is foolhardy enough to put their weight on them.

While it would of course have been 
miserable to be separated from one's family and placed in a 
colony, these pictures show that there were positives to be found in life at the colony.

Ancient: The colony opened in 1378 as one of the first homes for lepers in the whole of Europe

Beautiful: Photographer Kelly Katsarou managed to transform the creepy colony into these stunning images

Decline: The 19th century brought warfare and natural disasters to Chios

Some areas of the complex are undeniably beautiful, and it could have been a consolation to spend time with fellow sufferers who could empathise with each others' plight.

The colony at Chios began to decline during the 19th century, when the island was the centre of fierce fighting in the Greek War of Independence.

By the middle of the century Chios was largely deserted, and the situation was worsened by an 1881 earthquake which killed nearly 8,000 people.

The colony was finally shut down for 
good in 1957, by which time a cure had been found for leprosy and much 
of the stigma had disappeared in the West.

However, there are still hundreds of leper colonies open around the world, particularly in India.

Storeroom: Old furniture from the colony stacked up in a room since it closed down

Mystery: The cause of leprosy was unknown until it was discovered to be a bacterium in the late 19th century

Stigma: Many believed that the illness was a curse from God due to references to it in the Bible

Relic: But hundreds of leper colonies are still operating around the world, particularly in India

Back in time: The building has been left just as it was and is now a valuable historical exhibit

Grim: But some leprosy sufferers may have been able to enjoy a reasonable quality of life
