Being 'shared' or 'liked' on social media is worth its weight in gold these days, with plenty of companies looking to reward users and gain publicity for their brands.

It's a good time to be a popular person on Facebook, Instagram or Twitter, as travel companies and hotels have started to offer  'freebies' in exchange for recognition on social media.

Hotels and airlines are opening up to the commercial  opportunities of  tourists posting rave reviews or impressive holiday snaps through social media channels to their thousands of followers.

A little thing such as taking a selfie and sharing it on social networks can get you freebies on holiday

Many are more than willing to offer  healthy perks and discounts, so long as payment is offered in the form of positive reviews online.

Here, MailOnline Travel takes a look at some of the best deals on offer. 

A Nordic delight 

A hotel in Sweden offers discounted accommodation to those with a high number of Facebook friends and Instagram followers.

The Nordic Light Hotel in Stockholm launched a 'Social Network as Currency' promotion giving travellers anywhere from 10 per cent off the price of a room to a free one-night stay that usually costs  £230.

The promotion gives travellers from up to 100 per cent off the price off a room - usually costing around £230

The only caveat? Visitors must share a post when making the reservation, checking in and checking out

Anyone with  100,000 followers on Instagram, 2,000 private Facebook friends or 100,000 on a fan page, will be gifted seven nights per year at the hotel free.

The catch is that, in return, the hotel expects social media publicity.

As a visitor, you must share a post when making the reservation, then again at check-in and one at check-out.

The post must mention the hotel's website and Facebook page. 

The 'Instagram hotel' 

The unique boutique 1888 Hotel in Sydney, Australia has been designed with Instagram users in mind, meaning that every angle, every detail and every element of the hotel has been curated to be worthy of an Instagram photograph.
