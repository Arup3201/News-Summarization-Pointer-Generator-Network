More than 15million viewers stayed up to watch England kick off their World Cup campaign at 11pm on Saturday night.

But when all was said and done, our boys had slumped to another defeat ... and the nation needed a scapegoat.

Yet for once the national team had given fans a performance to be proud of – and so it was the BBC’s hapless pundit Phil Neville who bore the brunt of their frustrations.

Former England player Phil Neville has been criticised for his co-commentary by fans and celebrities on Twitter

Saturday was Neville’s first appearance as the Corporation’s new star pundit, and could prove to be his last after a brisk Twitter backlash.

While England’s players ran Italy close on the pitch, Neville appeared to be out of his depth in the commentary box.

Fans made fun of his robotic voice and dull insights, with some asking if he could be hauled off at half-time.  

He will be absent from England’s next two group games, which will be broadcast on ITV.

However, the BBC has refused to say whether Neville would return if the team makes the knock-out rounds.

The former England player, providing co-commentary alongside BBC regular Guy Mowbray, was compared by one viewer to the computer HAL from 2001: A Space Odyssey. Another suggested he would be better off presenting the Shipping Forecast.

He was even mocked by the police, with
 the South Warwickshire force’s official Twitter feed providing a string
 of safety advice based on his disastrous performance.

‘At
 least we know Phil Neville won’t stir the crowds in the pubs into a 
frenzy. Drink sensibly,’ read one message, while another claimed 
officers ‘will be playing recordings of Phil Neville all night to keep 
the streets all calm and sleepy’.

Some
 fans asked whether it was possible to fire a commentator at half-time, 
while former Liverpool midfielder Didier Hamann wrote: ‘If Phil Neville 
reads his Twitter feed he may not come out for the second half.’

More than 13million viewers stayed up until the final whistle, just before 1am yesterday morning.

The
 Corporation could not yet say how many viewers complained about 
Neville’s commentary, as weekend figures only become available on 
Mondays.

It stressed that Neville had received training before being allowed on-air but, when asked whether he would return for the BBC’s next live England game, a spokesman said: ‘Everything for the final 16 will be decided much closer to the time.’

Critics suggested Neville’s appointment showed the folly of the BBC favouring ‘big names’ over seasoned professionals for its punditry team.

Luckily, Neville – the brother of England assistant coach Gary – seems to have taken the comments in good spirits.

He tweeted last night: ‘Sometimes you have to take the criticism – it will only make me better. Thanks for the feedback (ahhahaha)!’

The BBC gave England’s fans false hope after just a few minutes, when its on-screen graphic incorrectly put England 1-0 up.

The blunder came after Raheem Sterling thumped a shot at goal from 30 yards that appeared to fly into the top corner.

‘Goal’ flashed up on the BBC’s coverage, and the score in the corner of the screen was changed to ‘ENG 1-0 ITA’ – but viewers were bemused to see Sterling fail to celebrate after such an excellent strike.

In truth, Sterling’s shot was off-target, with the net only bulging because the ball had hit the side netting. The BBC swiftly rectified their error.
