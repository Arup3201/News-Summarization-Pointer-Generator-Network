Alatan Hsia needs £17,000 to have the pins and needles, pictured here in a doctor's x-ray, removed from her body

A Chinese woman ended up with a real case of pins and needles - after doctors found nine of them embedded in her body.

Medics x-rayed Alatan Hsia, from Jarud Banner in north China’s Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, in a bid to get to the bottom of incredible pains she had suffered from for more than a decade.

But after identifying that pins and needles had been inserted into her body, she now needs to come up with £17,000 to pay for them to be removed.

She said: ‘I have suffered from the pain for years. I guess a little while longer before I finally get free of it is something I can bear.’

Some of the needles were easy to remove but others need a complicated medical procedure.

One needle is embedded in a lung, one in a kidney and one in the liver.

Pins were also found in a leg joint and one was located just three centimetres from her heart.

Alatan, a herdswoman on the Mongolian steppe, added: ‘I used to have a terrible marriage.

'My ex-husband Chung Hsiao frequently beat me. Finally, at the end of 2002, I went to my parents’ home to avoid him.

‘One day when I was there and my folks were out he came around and gave me a beating.  He shouted: “If you won't return to me I will kill you.” I was beaten into a coma.

'When I woke up five days later my parents said that there had been no sign of him, and they had put me in bed until I recovered.

‘None of us thought much of it but they also said that they had found nine needles on the ground lying alongside my body.

‘I believe that after putting some of them inside me he had then fled leaving others on the floor.’

In 2002, after the attack, Alatan and her husband divorced and she married another man, Long Han.

However, she always felt incredible pain in her body in the following years but it was only when she had an x-ray that she finally discovered the cause.
