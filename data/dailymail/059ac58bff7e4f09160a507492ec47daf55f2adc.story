In his press conference yesterday, President Barack Obama said that there was 'overwhelming evidence' Syrian President Bashar al-Assad carried out a chemical weapons attack against rebels in the suburbs of Damascus on August 21.

What he didn't mention was that his administration knew about the alleged nerve-gas attack three days before it happened.

At a U.S. intelligence briefing Friday afternoon, senior administration officials disclosed that there were indications three days prior that an attack was coming.

Advanced notice: According to a report released Friday, the U.S. received signals that the Syrian military was about to carry out a chemical weapons attack on August 21, three days before it happened

Ready: President Obama announced in a press conference yesterday that he had enough evidence to justify a military strike against Syria. What he didn't mention is how intelligence officials knew about the attack before it happened

'In the three days prior to the attack, we collected streams of human, signals and geospatial intelligence that reveal regime activities that we assess were association with preparations for a chemical weapons attack,' the U.S. intelligence report released by the Obama administration said.

At the briefing, officials would not answer of whether or not they warned rebel forced before the attack.

But at least two opposition members told Foreign Policy magazine that they had no idea the attack was coming. 

Dishad Othman is a Syrian activist and secure-communications expert living in the U.S. He says his opposition contacts in Syria had no warning before the chemical weapons attack.

'If you knew, why did you take no action?' Othman asked.

Razan Zaitouneh, another opposition member who lives in one of the towns affected, said she too knew nothing about the oncoming attack.

'It's unbelievable that they did nothing to warn people to stop the regime before the crime,' she said.

Questions: Members of the Syrian opposition questioned why the U.S. didn't warn them an attack was coming if they knew about it three days before it happened

The U.S. intelligence report concluding that the Assad regime had used chemical weapons against it's own people on August 21 was based on 'a substantial body of information' including satellite imagery, intercepted communications and social media reports around the time of the attack .

'Our high confidence assessment is the strongest position that the U.S. Intelligence Community can take short of confirmation,' the report said. 'We will continue to seek additional information to close gaps in our understanding of what took place.'

One of those gaps seems to be whether the order was executed at a high level within the Syrian military, or if it was carried out by a rogue military officer.

One of the reports confirming the attack happened came from a phone call intercepted by the U.S. between a panicked Syrian Minister of Defense and the leader of a chemical weapons unit.

The minster was demanding answers for the strike which could be evidence that it wasn't directly orderd by President Assad.

Nevertheless, in his speech yesterday, President Obama said he is holding President Assad responsible.

The U.S. has determined that 1,429 people were killed in the chemical weapons attack on a suburb of Damascus on August 21.

The chemicals weapons used a nerve-gas agent which caused it's victims to asphyxiate.

Intel says that 426 children were among the attack's victims.

Innocents: According to U.S. estimates, of the 1,429 killed in the attack, 426 were children

An assessment conducted by British intelligence estimates a much lower death toll of 350 people.

But President Obama and Secretary of State John Kerry are confident that the attack happened and that any military action in the country won't be like the 2003 invasion of Iraq for so-called 'weapons of mass destruction.'

'We will not repeat that moment,' Secretary Kerry said.

Which is why President Obama announced yesterday that the U.S. 'should take military action' even before U.N. inspectors have finished their investigation.

Weapons inspectors left Syria yesterday and now need at least 10 to 14 days to analyze samples they took from the attack site to verify if nerve gas was used.

'Redundant': The UN high representative for disarmament affairs negotiated with President Assad to let weapons inspectors into the country last week. They now need 10 to 14 days to analyze the samples they collected

The White House has called this investigation 'redundant' so President Obama has set up the military strike, pending approval from Congress.

It's still uncertain whether or not Congress will support the strikes and there is a chance that they will vote against the strikes as the UK's Parliament did last week.

Whether or not Congress approves the strikes, they will no longer come as a surprise to President Assad who has been given time to build up his defenses.

'This is one worry that we have. Sice the international community has begun talking about a response to the chemical massacre, what we have noticed is that the Assad regime has started moving different military units into different areas,' Khaled Saleh, media director of the Syrian National Coalition told Foreign Policy magazine. 'So they're using that time to hide their more well-armed units. And you know, when they move them to schools, the U.S. and the international community can't do a whole lot about that.'

Pending approval: President Obama said he would wait to get authorization from Congress before carrying out any strike. He was pictured speaking on the phone to Speaker of the House John Boehner yesterday
