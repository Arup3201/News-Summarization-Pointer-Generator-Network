She's already managed to make an enemy of the usually friendly Holly Willoughby and now it would appear that Katie Hopkins has managed to offend Ultimo boss Michelle Mone too.

A bitter Twitter war has broken out between Mone and former Apprentice contestant Hopkins, with Mone questioning Hopkins fame and telling her to keep her 'vile opinions' to herself.

Hopkins, who has caused controversy with her forthright opinions on children's names, retaliated by goading Mone about her weight.

'More wisdom from the large lady of the 
bra factory in the North? As the tortoise said to the snail. Has anyone 
seen me shell?' she wrote.

Furious: Mone described Hopkins' views on baby names and ginger people as 'vile'

Most recently, Hopkins provoked outrage when she said ginger babies were 'harder to love' - much to the fury of Mone and many others.

Last night Mone tweeted: 'She won't 
employ fat people, judges kids by their names [and] says ginger babies are
hard to love, keep your vile opinions to yourself, Katie Hopkins.'

Hopkins, who has stood by her comments about wanting her children to avoid 'the Tylers, the Charmaines, the Chantelles, the Chardonnays,' retorted with a number of vicious tweets of her own.

'Less tweeting, more concentrating 'shell. You just missed that important stitching on the under wire there now.'

Furious Mone then replied: 'Leave my multi-million £ business out 
of it.. my Tweets are for all the Tyler's, gingers and larger, highly 
employable people out there who you've put down.'

Responding to the jibe about her weight, Mone tweeted a photo of a healthy salad and shellfish meal and added: '1 week till I take kids
sailing round Spain.Few pounds to shift, thanks for reminding me Miss 
Katie Hopkins.'

Cashing in: Hopkins has chosen to cash in on the controversy by launching a book named The Class Book Of Baby Names

Members of the public who followed the row on Twitter overwhelmingly took the side of Mone and Hopkins was subjected to a barrage of insulting tweets from her followers.

'Your a vile human being... I actually 
feel sorry for your kids,' said one, while another added: 'Michelle: 
successful, sexy entrepreneur! Katie: fame-hungry hoor! #nocontest'

One follower simply asked: 'and what is you do again Kate ??????'

Both Mone and Hopkins have struggled with controversy in recent weeks with Hopkins hitting TV studios to justify her controversial views.

Last week, she appeared on This Morning, where she told presenters Holly Willoughby and Phillip Schofield: 'It isn't just 
about class, it's probably about the fact they haven't done their 
homework - there's a whole set of things that go with children like that
that is quite a disruptive influence in school.'

However Willoughby 
struggled to keep calm during the debate, at one point telling her: 'Oh 
stop. Stop right there' much to Hopkins' surprise.

Hopkins has now cashed in on the controversy caused by her views on baby names and has written an e-book entitled The Class Book Of Baby Names.

In the tome, which is already on sale via Amazon, she outlines why some names work and others do not.

Highlights include: 'Take Ashley. Shut your eyes and picture mum: legging clad, slightly overweight and clutching Primark bags twice the size of her latest baby. There may be another one on the way, but you can never be sure.

'There only so many times you can hear 'TYLER' yelled aggressively across a playground before you work out Tyler means trouble.'

Meanwhile, mother-of-three Mone recently agreed a multi-million pound deal with ex-husband Michael for the control of her company.

She revealed she drank up to a bottle of wine a day during her marriage break-up which eventually cost her £24million.

The 41-year-old was speaking out for the
first time since her bitter divorce from Michael, who left her for 
former employee Samantha Bunn.

She was forced to buy Mr Mone out of the
family's Ultimo underwear business in a £24m deal when their marriage 
ended in December 2011.

Soon after, he announced he was setting up a rival firm with Ms Bunn as chief lingerie designer.
