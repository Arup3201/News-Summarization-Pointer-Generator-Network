Taking part in a Q&A session with the club, Everton boss Martinez revealed that Stones, who earned his first England cap in May, will travel to Spain to see the Catalan giants in action.

With each training exercise seen as a 
competition in which Blues players accumulated points, Everton's first-teamers battled it out to be named the 'best trainer'.

Gareth Barry, who spent last season on loan at Goodison Park and is still wanted by the Merseysiders having been released by Manchester City, was the overall winner.

The 33-year-old received a watch with his inscription on it having come out on top above the likes of Ross Barkley, Leighton Baines and Romelu Lukaku.

Stones and Barry both impressed for the Blues last season as Martinez guided Everton to fifth place in the Barclays Premier League during his first season with the club.

While hoping Stones enjoys the experience, there is no doubt Martinez will be advising the youngster take note and examine just how one of the best teams in the world set-up and play in a bid to improve the defender's own game.

Already a confident player who likes to bring the ball out from the back, it will do Stones no harm at all seeing the likes of Gerard Pique, Lionel Messi and Andres Iniesta up close.
