The influenza season is a thorn in the side of both employees and employers alike.

But a first-of-its-kind oral antiseptic spray promises to end the annual misery endured by millions of flu sufferers, and thousands of lives, around the world. Or so its manufacturer claims.

The Halo Oral Antiseptic has been found to be 99.9 per cent effective in killing infectious airborne germs.

Breakthrough? An oral antiseptic spray promises to end the annual misery endured by millions of flu sufferers, and thousands of lives, around the world

Lead author Dr Frank Esper, from the 
University Hospitals Case Medical Center in Cleveland, Ohio, said: 
'Respiratory tract disease is a major cause of morbidity and mortality 
throughout the world. Yet there has been limited progress in the 
prevention of respiratory virus infections.

'Halo is unique in that it offers protection from airborne germs such as influenza and rhinovirus.'

The
scientists used glycerine and xanthan gum as a microbial barrier 
combined with cetylpyridinium chloride (CPC) as a broad-spectrum 
anti-infective agent to fight respiratory illnesses.Â 

To
test this, clinical strains of 2009 pandemic H1N1 were used as a 
prototype virus to demonstrate Halo's anti-infective activity in cell 
culture assays.

Dr 
Esper said: 'The glycerine and xanthan gum prevent the germs from 
entering a person's system and the CPC kills the germs once they're 
trapped there.'

He said
Halo will have clear benefit to aid against infection and reduce 
disease from epidemic, sporadic or pandemic respiratory viral 
infections, particularly helping people at risk for severe respiratory 
illness including immune-compromised individuals with chronic lung 
disease, and military personnel.

The study findings were presented 
yesterday at the Interscience Conference on Antimicrobial Agents and 
Chemotherapy in San Francisco.

Easy-to-use: The Halo Oral Antiseptic has been found to be 99.9 per cent effective in killing infectious airborne germs

Regular application: The spray needs to be used three times each day to prove effective

Another study on Halo will be presented by Dr Mahmoud Ghannoum of UH Case Medical Center, also in Cleveland, showing Halo's effectiveness against disease-causing pathogenic germs.

That study asserts that respiratory and/or systemic infections through airborne and manually transmitted pathogenic microbes often enter the system through the mouth, making Halo, an oral spray that targets these pathogens, an effective way to prevent infections.

Additionally, preliminary data from the researchers found that Halo completely kills all 11 clinical strains of whooping cough against which the spray was tested.

The results showed that when a person used three sprays of Halo, it destroyed airborne germs breathed in for up to six hours, even when people were eating and drinking.

The concept of coating the back of the oral cavity to prevent germs from entering and then providing sustained antiseptic action to kill airborne germs was developed by a Cleveland company, Oasis Consumer Healthcare.

Dr Ghannoum said: 'Exposure to airborne germs is inevitable - especially in crowded environments and when travelling. Unlike other products that support the immune system or protect from germs on surfaces or hands, Halo is the first and only product of its kind to offer protection from airborne germs.'

The Halo Oral Antiseptic is on sale in the U.S. now.
