Richard Holloway, 29, a Captain in the Royal Engineers, was shot and killed two days before Christmas

A soldier from the Royal Engineers who was killed in action in Afghanistan two days before Christmas Day was 'an exceptional young man' who 'embraced life to the full', his family has said.

Captain Richard Holloway, 29, from County Durham, was named by the Ministry of Defence today after he was killed as a result of enemy fire while on operations east of Kabul on December 23.

According to defence sources, Captain  Holloway was serving with the Special Boat Service on a secret mission.

His commanding officer, who cannot be named for security reasons, said Capt Holloway died as a result of direct enemy fire while leading from the front, adding: ‘He was one of the best; a natural leader.’

He leaves behind parents Jaquie and Neil, brother Luke and girlfriend Sandy.

In a statement, his family said: 'Our son Richard was an exceptional young man, a perfectionist in everything he did and a loyal brother and friend, who embraced life to the full.'

They added: 'He was a dedicated and totally committed member of the armed forces, relishing the excitement and challenge but always serious and reflective about his duties and responsibilities to those with whom he served.

'The sense of adventure he experienced with the Royal Engineers was echoed in his love of travel to faraway places and physical activity including surfing, kayaking, canoeing, mountain-biking and climbing.

'Wherever the action was, he wanted to be part of it - and that is where our beloved son, of whom we are so very proud, lost his life.'

Captain Ed Martin, from the Royal Engineers, said Capt Holloway, who was best man at his wedding earlier this year, was an 'inspiration to others'.

'There was never a second wasted with Rich, he always had a plan and made the most of every day,' he said.

'He lived life to the full and was an inspiration to others to do the same.

'I have never met a more trustworthy, loyal or dedicated friend, he had humility in spades and I would have followed him anywhere.

Captain Holloway's commanding officer said he was 'revered' by the Afghans who he trained (file picture)

'I am very lucky to have known him and
 feel exceptionally fortunate to have had him as the best man at my 
wedding earlier this year, he will be dearly missed.

'But
 my loss is only minor compared to that of his parents Jaquie and Neil, 
his brother Luke and girlfriend Sandy. My thoughts are with them all at 
this incredibly difficult time. Rest in peace.'

Capt
 Holloway's commanding officer, who has not been named, said the soldier
 was 'a natural leader' who was 'revered by the Afghans whom he mentored
 tirelessly'.

'His tactical ability commanded wide respect; his judgment was un-erring, his enthusiasm was infectious and his standards never dropped,' he said.

'He had a humble self-confidence that instinctively drew people to him. His own brand of selflessness and professionalism marked him out as a soldier, but it was the warmth of his personality that set him out as a popular and effective leader.

'It is hard to track, but at some point in the process Rich established himself not just as a highly respected troop commander, but one of the principal characters within the unit.

The drawdown of British and US troops is underway and due to be complete by the end of 2014

'In doing a difficult job in 
Afghanistan, he displayed a rare empathy and cultural understanding that
 ensured he was highly valued and revered by the Afghans whom he 
mentored tirelessly, as well as his colleagues.

'He
 will be sorely missed by all those who had the privilege to work 
alongside him, but his memory will never be allowed to fade.'

Captain
 Andy Brett, from Royal Engineers, said: 'It was a privilege to know 
Rich. He set the highest standards and achieved professional excellence.
 He always inspired me to do better. He taught me to enjoy life and make
 the most of every adventure. He will be remembered.'

Capt Holloway's death took the number 
of UK service members who have lost their lives since operations in 
Afghanistan began in October 2001 to 447 and was the ninth this year.

The
 majority of British forces are in Helmand Province, in the south of the
 country, but some also operate elsewhere, including in and around the 
capital, Kabul.

The drawdown of British troops is under way, and all combat troops are due to have left by the end of 2014.

There
 are just four bases remaining outside Camp Bastion, due to be closed 
down one by one in the new year, and the number of personnel has been 
reduced from 9,000 at the start of the year to around 5,200.

Defence Secretary Philip Hammond said: "It was with great sadness that I learnt of the death of Captain Richard Holloway.

'It is clear from the tributes that have been paid to him that he was an officer who set the highest of standards and was liked and respected in equal measure by his colleagues and commanders.

'His great contribution and, indeed, his sacrifice will not be forgotten. My thoughts and deepest sympathies are with Captain Holloway's family, friends and colleagues at this most difficult time.'
