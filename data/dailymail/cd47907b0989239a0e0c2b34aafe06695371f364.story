A semi-professional rugby player punched his model girlfriend in the face after she caught him flirting on Facebook, a court heard.

Swansea RFC hooker Paul John, 26, is accused of leaving his partner Amy John scarred for life after he 'hit her in the face' during the row at his parents' home in Porthcawl, South Wales.

The captain of the Welsh club denied a charge of unlawful wounding when he appeared on trial at Cardiff Crown Court yesterday.

The jury heard how the pair, who are not married and coincidentally share a surname, started arguing after a night spent drinking and socialising with friends.

They had returned to the house in Porthcawl when Miss John, a pathology graduate, found flirty messages on her boyfriend's Facebook account, the jury heard.

She had checked his account while he was in the bathroom getting ready for bed.

She told the jury: 'When I found he'd been chatting to other girls - and there were quite a few messages - I was really upset and just wanted to leave.

'But he said I wasn't leaving and hit me with his fist.

'I was genuinely shocked, I thought he was a nice boy and that's why I chose to be with him.

'I turned to the mirror behind me and there was blood dripping out of my lip.'

After the row Miss John, a model, was taken  to Princess of Wales Hospital, Bridgend, where she had stitches

The pathology graduate told the jury at Cardiff Crown Court: 'I will have the scar for the rest of my life'

Miss John was taken by her father to Princess of Wales Hospital in Bridgend where she received stitches for her injury.

She was later transferred on to Morriston Hospital in Swansea to see a plastic surgeon.

She told the court: 'I will have the scar for the rest of my life. I can cover it with make-up but that doesn't mean it is not there.'

John, of Porthcawl, denies a charge of unlawful wounding, and when interviewed police, he told them: 'I would never punch her.'

Following the alleged incident, he told officers that Miss John had kicked him twice in the groin as he tried to stop her leaving his parents' home, and he had caught her accidentally in the face.

However, Miss John told the court she believed it had been deliberate and denied making contact with John.

She said: 'There was no shouting because his parents were asleep but I went down to the porch where we had taken off our shoes and tried to put mine on to go.

'But he said I wasn't leaving, wouldn't give me my keys, and was pulling at my shoes and legs and making me feel trapped. 

'The front door was locked.

'He was crouching in front of me and I kicked out, aiming for his groin, but I know I didn't make contact because he stared at me, stood up, leaned over, glared and hit me with his fist.'

During the hearing, defence counsel Elwen Evans QC told her: 'You kicked him in his private parts and all he did was push you away.'

However, she responded: 'Pushing me away would not have caused me to need surgery.'

She accepted in answer to Ms Evans that she was using the experience in her application to study for a doctorate, having already completed her master's degree.

'There are consequences to actions,' she said.

'If I punched someone I would have to face up to it. 

'He is dragging me through this [the court] by pleading not guilty.'

Ms John, a volunteer with the NHS and the police, said she had decided not to call the police at first but later changed her mind.

'He told me on Facebook that he would lose his job and I felt under pressure,' she said. 'I felt like I was the one in the wrong.'

John denies a charge of unlawful wounding.

The trial continues.
