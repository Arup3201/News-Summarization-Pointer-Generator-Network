Three years after the devastating tsunami that killed more than 15,000 people, Japan is still in mourning of the event that ravaged coastal communities and triggered a nuclear crisis.

In the anniversary ceremony, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe pledged to boost rebuilding efforts, after they have struggled to rebuild towns and villages, and clean up the radiation from the subsequent meltdown at the Fukushima Dai-ichi nuclear power plant. 

Thanks to shortages of skilled workers and materials, reconstruction efforts, which have finally started getting on their way, are already somewhat delayed.

The disaster, which took place in 2011, killed 15,884 and left 2,636 missing on the northeastern coast of Japan, and the country has set aside 25 trillion yen (£150 billion) for reconstruction efforts.

Even after three years, nearly 270,000 people are displaced, with many coming from the Fukushima areas, where there is still heavy radioactive contamination, and many areas are still off limits.

The plant, which is being decommissioned, a process expected to take 40 years, has stabilised significantly, but there are still often leaks of radioactive water, among other problems, which have delayed the plant's decommissioning.

The Prime Minister has spent time visiting several of the areas hit by the disaster since he started the job in 2012, and said he noticed that farming and fishing was up, and that people had been moved to shelters from public housing, but he still pledged to do more.

He said: 'We must further speed up the reconstruction so that everyone affected by
 the disasters can return to ordinary life as soon as possible.'

During a ceremony in Tokyo, officials and representatives of the survivors observed a minute's silence to mark the moment, at 2:46 p.m., when the magnitude 9.0 earthquake struck off the Tohoku coast, the strongest quake recorded in Japan's history.

On March 11 Japan commemorated the third anniversary of the magnitude 9.0 earthquake and tsunami that claimed more than 15,000 lives

Abe promised to move communities along the coast to higher ground to avoid future tsunamis, and build thousands more public housing units within a year in the Iwate and Miyagi areas of Japan.

Emperor Akihito, who attended the ceremony, said that his heart breaks when he thinks of the Fukushima residents who have no idea if they can ever return home.

He said: 'Many disaster survivors are still experiencing difficulties.

'It is important that all people of Japan unite their hearts and stand by each other for a long period so that they can live without losing their hopes and in good health.'

In northern Japan, tsunami survivors held their own memorial events for their loved ones.

In the once-bustling fishing town of Minamisanriku, local residents gathered at what used to be the town's disaster prevention center, where dozens of citizens died in the tsunami.

The residents prayed in front of a small table filled with flowers, a Buddha statue and incense.

Much of the town's coastal area remains deserted, except for a few structures that survived.

Thanks to the trillions of yen earmarked for the restoration, rebuilding, and search efforts, recovery is beginning. But it is also slow, and held back by numerous delays that are, in part, due to radioactive contamination

Katsuo Izumi, who lost his wife in the tsunami, said his disaster-hit town of Higashi-Matsushima has seen some rebuilding of public housing, schools and other facilities. Altogether, the city lost 1,000 residents.

He said: 'We survivors have a responsibility to live a full life on behalf of those who perished in the tsunami.

'I hope to see the reconstruction achieved as soon as possible.'
