After suffering a few black eyes in the press over the last several years, the U.S. Secret Service currently is the subject of some positive headlines.

Earlier this week, a woman collapsed in front of the White House and went into full cardiac arrest.

Luckily, Secret Service agents were nearby - and thanks to their swift response, the woman is still alive.

Emergency: The unidentified woman collapsed in front of the White House about 1 p.m. Thursday

Response: Agents start giving the woman CPR as another agents rushes to get a defibrillator from his vehicle

Zap: The agents used the defibrillator on the woman several times before the ambulance arrived to take her to the hospital

About 1 p.m. Thursday, the 59-year-old woman collapsed near 17th St and Pennsylvania Avenue in Washington D.C. In the area was an officer from the agency's Uniformed Division who saw that the woman was in trouble and acted immediately.

'He assessed the situation, she was unconscious and unresponsive, and so
 he radioed in another uniformed division officer,' Secret Service 
spokesman George Ogilvie told ABC News.

'She was not breathing and was turning blue,' Ogilvie told the network.

The second agent to arrive on the scene also is a trained EMT.

In the nick of time: After several minutes of trying to revive the woman, the ambulance arrives to take her to the hospital

Recovering: The unidentified woman was rushed to George Washington Hospital, where she is recovering

Over the next 16 minutes, the agents performed CPR on the woman and retrieved an automated external defibrillator from their vehicle - and a camera was rolling to record the entire ordeal

'They actually delivered a shock, and continued with compression until 
DC Fire [Department] responded,' Ogilvie said of Officer William 
Grimmer, who first saw the woman collapse, and Officer Thomas Hammond, 
the trained EMT.

The unidentified woman was taken to George Washington Hospital, where she currently is recovering.
