A milk and yoghurt company has lost a $50,000 deal with Middle Eastern airline Emirates after scrapping its halal certification due to increasing social media backlash. 

The Fleurieu Milk and Yoghurt Company dropped its accreditation on Friday after being targeted by anti-Halal groups on social media who made claims the $1,000 fee it paid to become Halal certified could be used to fund terrorism, the ABC reports.

The South Australian company were halal-certified for two years before the aggressive social media campaign last week urging a boycott on Halal products throughout the country.

Sales and marketing manager Nick Hutchinson said they pulled the pin due to negative publicity, but hoped the ditched deal wouldn't effect redundancies or lost hours for employees. 

'The publicity we were getting was quite negative and something we probably didn't need and we decided we would pull the pin and stop supplying Emirates Airlines,' Mr Hutchinson said. 

'When our small customer base in South Australia are reading this and starting to question us we thought, yeah maybe the negatives outweigh the positive.'

Facebook pages like Halal Choices and Boycott Halal in Australia suggested the halal certification was a religious tax, that it was cruel to slaughter animals and that the $1,000 fee could be used to fund Islamic extremists abroad. 

Halal certified foods have been specially prepared or slaughtered in accordance with Islamic law.  

'We thought this was a great coup for the company, it would bring great publicity, great advertising and we decided to go ahead with it,' Mr Hutchinson said. 

'It's been quite successful for the company, but unfortunately over the last few days, a lot of negative publicity has come in about this Halal certification and where this money, where we are paying fees is being spent.' 

The South Australian company started supplying Emirates with its halal-certified yoghurt two years ago

The company took to Facebook to announce the news last Friday, but has since deactivated its account

The eight-year-old company hopes to save the deal with Emirates, but maintains the prospect remains unlikely. 

'Milk as a dairy product does not have to be Halal certified by law, and neither does yoghurt, which we were supplying, unless it contains gelatine,' he said. 

'Now our yoghurt doesn't contain gelatine so we can definitely argue the fact that it doesn't need to be certified for Emirates [but] they play it safe. Anything that goes on their planes needs to be certified, so if they're asked, they can automatically answer 'yes'.

'What we are going to try and do is get our products tested, get some certificates that prove that our products don't contain gelatine and try to continue to supply Emirates, if they'll give us permission without the certification, but I mean that is unlikely.'

The eight-year-old yoghurt company hopes to save the deal with Emirates, but maintains the prospect remains unlikely because of its strict halal certification policies 

Australian pie company Vili's has also been the target of anti-halal campaigns, but said it refuses to bend to social media pressure, The Advertiser reports. 

'From a purely economic viewpoint, halal certification brings a lot of money into Australia,' a Vili spokesman said.

'When you look at these sites you get the impression that a lot of the comments are written in the same voice and probably come from the same source.'

He said he hoped Fleurieu Milk Company wasn't 'being influenced unnecessarily'.
