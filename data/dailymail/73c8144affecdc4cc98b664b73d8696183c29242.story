A teacher who had a major meltdown and suffered chronic depression, due to 'feral' and 'unruly' students, has been awarded almost $770,000 in damages.

Peter Doulis, 48, sued the Victorian education department after he claimed he was left unable to work because he was forced to teach some of worst behaved students at Werribee secondary college between 1998 and 2004. 

The Supreme court ruling which was handed down Friday, could also set a precedent, and pave the way for more action against the Victorian Education department. 

Teacher Peter Doulis was awarded almost $770,000 in damages after he claimed he suffered major depression and a meltdown from being forced to teach some of the worst behaved students at Werribee Secondary college (pictured) between 1998 and 2004

The Supreme court ruled in favour of a Melbourne teacher who claimed he was left unable to work after being subject to 'feral' and 'unruly' students at Werribee Secondary College between 1998 and 2004. Peter Doulis says some students would be 'virtually crawling up the wall' before his classes

The court was told, Mr Doulis was threatened while teaching at the school.

ABC News reported he described how 'feral' students would be 'virtually crawling up the wall' before his classes and in one instance a student, armed with a makeshift flame thrower, singed another student's jumper.  

The supreme court voted in favour of the teachers claims, finding the school had breached it's duty of care to Mr Doulis.

'I find that that breach of duty was a cause of the chronic severe major depressive condition that he now has,' ABC News reported the judge saying.

'I also consider that, had Mr Doulis's workload of low classes and foundation classes been reduced, and if he had been supported in his teaching duties, then it is probable that his psychiatric condition would not have deteriorated.' 

Principal Kevin O'Neil commented on behalf of the school and the education department releasing a statement.

'Our school has a learning model that allocates students to classes based on their different academic achievement levels, allowing them to move up and down the levels each semester as their achievements change,' he said.

'this allows our teachers to target their teaching to the appropriate level and spend more time teaching level-appropriate content and less time addressing the varied needs of students in mixed classes.' 

Mr O'Neil also added that the results of the model are clearly demonstrated by the school's VCE performance, which is consistently higher than similar schools.

'Our teachers also benefit from this model. It allows them to become well rounded and dynamic.'

'All of our teachers are given classes across levels and we do not disproportionately allocate any teachers to any one level. We no longer allow teachers to request to teach at only one level.'

The statement also added, quoting directly from the judgment –'The evidence at trial established that the College is now one of the finest schools in the western suburbs of Melbourne.'

The Victorian Workcover Authority also commented on the ruling saying it will consider the judgement handed down in the Supreme Court.

'A decision as to whether or not the matter will be appealed will be made in due course,' said a Victorian Workcover Authority spokesperson.

A separate hearing to determine compensation for future losses will be held later this month.
