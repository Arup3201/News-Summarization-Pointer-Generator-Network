He’s a bit early for Christmas … but perhaps someone told this robin that the early bird catches the worm. 

And in this case, he’s catching mealworms, breadcrumbs and even bowls of hot porridge.

The redbreast has started visiting Pat Lowe as many as 15 times a day, cheekily tapping on her window every morning until she lets him into her kitchen.

Bob the Robin visits Pat Lowe's kitchen up to 15 times a day to peck on breadcrumbs, worms and porridge

While Bob snacks on most things laid out by Mrs Lowe, his favourite is cooked porridge, she said 

Mrs Lowe, who has eight grandchildren, cooks porridge for the animal to keep him warm in the winter 

Mrs Lowe has tried to shoo the animal away to 'find his friends' but he returns day after day for more food 

Once inside, he breakfasts on the array of food that she buys to feed to the birds in her garden – as well as the treats his ‘surrogate mother’ whips up just for him. 

And then he makes himself at home, fluttering to and fro through the back door all day as he picks up more snacks.

Grandmother-of-eight Mrs Lowe, 77, said the bird, who she calls Bob, first appeared over the summer in the garden of the home she shares with husband Richard, 82, near Lydney, Gloucestershire.

She added: ‘I didn’t go out into the garden one day and then he started coming into the house – he thinks I’m his mummy. 

The 77-year-old said Bob has begun following her into the house after she didn't go into the garden one day

Favourite things: Mrs Lowe leaves out a tray with a variety of snacks on it for the little bird to enjoy 

Making himself at home: Bob is not frightened off by either Mrs Lowe or her husband but isn't quite comfortable enough to start eating out of the 77-year-old's hand 

While the pensioner enjoys having the bird in her home, she said she will be forced to make him wear a nappy

The animal appeared at Pat Lowe's window one day when the pensioner failed to go out into the garden 

Puffing his red and grey belly out, the bird rests on the edge of a chair and on Mrs Lowe's kitchen counter 

Taking off: Once he has had enough to eat Bob goes out back into the garden before returning later 

The bird is not frightened by humans and once flew over the postman's head to get into the house 

Bob taps on the window with his beak when he wants to be let back into the house in Gloucestershire 

'Umpteen times I’ve let him out the window and said “Go and find your friends”.

‘But he goes away for a little while and then the next day, he’s back. 

'He’s not scared of anybody. The other day, I opened the door for the postman and Bob flew over the postman’s head and came in.

‘He loves porridge – I cook it for him to keep him nice and warm for the winter. He’s not eating out of my hand yet, but I’m working on it.’
