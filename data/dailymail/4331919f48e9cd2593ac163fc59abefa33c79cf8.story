A man has been accused of luring a six-year-old girl into his motel room with snacks, throttling her, and then stuffing her body under his bed.

John P Roberts, 55, was charged with the murder of schoolgirl Jasmine Miller this weekend, after she went missing in Branson, Missouri.

A probable cause statement said her lifeless body was found under the bed in Roberts's room, in the same long-stay motel where Jasmine's family were living.

'Sweet girl': Neighbors described how Jasmine was compassionate and comforted an ill neighbor after he was too weak to push his children on a swing set

Jasmine's family reported her missing Saturday night, and officers searching the roadside lodgings at the Windsor Inn found her soon after.

Police said in a news release that they believe he acted alone.

Roberts was already on bail after being charged with a burglary - which he has claimed he committed so he could afford to eat.

Roberts remained jailed without bond Monday in Taney County after making his first court appearance on a first-degree murder charge in Jasmine's death. 

Roberts met with his public defender and was scheduled to appear in court next on March 10, online court records show. They do not identify the public defender.

Neighbors described Jasmine as a sweet girl who was eager to help other people.

Paul Dubois, a cancer sufferer whose daughter was friends with Jasmine, described how she consoled him in a park after his illness left him too weak to push his kids on the swings.

He said: 'She hugged me and said it doesn't matter the fact that I can't do what other parents can do.'

At the same time, other residents at the motel were shocked that Roberts could be a murderer.

Kristen Patteron, who said she spoke to Roberts every day, told local TV station KSPR:  'He would help out with anything anybody asked him to.' 

She told the television station: 'I couldn't believe that he would do something like that - I would have never imagined him to even have that kind of a thought in his head to do something like that.

Windsor Inn resident Tammy Meyer said her children played with Jasmine, and she and her 17-year-old daughter helped search for the girl before she was found. 

Judson Wall, who is representing Roberts in the burglary case, was not available for comment.
