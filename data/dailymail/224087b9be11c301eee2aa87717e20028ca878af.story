A photographer has captured the moment a man diced with death after he climbed onto a rocky outpost cut off by huge waves.

The man scaled the 50ft ancient rock stack on the Isle of Portland near Weymouth in Dorset and stood at the top for 10 minutes as huge storms battered the coastline yesterday.

He has been branded ‘a lunatic’ for the daredevil stunt on Pulpit Rock, which has prompted coastguards to issue a warning.

The man was pictured standing on top of 50ft Pulpit Rock on the Isle of Portland for 10 minutes during severe storms yesterday

Photographer Sean Hepburn, 50, was documenting yesterday’s storms, which saw gale-force winds of more than 60mph, when he spotted the man.

Mr Hepburn said: ‘I live on Portland and spend a lot of time on the headland taking photos of the weather.

‘I went up there yesterday and set up at a safe place I use a lot to get some pictures of the huge waves that were crashing over the rocks.

‘It was a lot rougher than I had expected it to be.

‘Then, along came a lunatic and his girlfriend who tried to climb to the top of Pulpit Rock, an exposed rock stack right on the tip of the headland.

‘It's a real scramble to get up onto it at the best of times let alone when there are monster waves crashing all around it.’

He added that the woman that was with the man was ‘obviously disgusted’ with his behaviour and left.

‘He stayed on top of the rock for 10 minutes then got back down.

‘He was incredibly lucky a big wave didn't break over the rock during that time.

He is seen attempting to scramble back down the rock as waves crash violently against it. Coastguards have since issued a warning

‘The ones that were breaking onto the shore were just colossal.

‘If he had ended up in the sea he would without a doubt have been a goner. It’s just ridiculous – it’s not worth the risk.’

He added: ‘Freak waves do break over Pulpit Rock in big seas and it would only take one to come in and it would be game over for anyone on top of the rock.’

Coastguards said apart from risking their own lives, these stunts also endangered teams going to their rescue as it draws away resources which could be needed to help people in ‘genuine distress’.

Mike Douglas, from the Maritime and Coastguard Agency, said: ‘Our advice is to stay away from cliff edges or rocks as they can be crumbly or slippery when wet, which is certainly the case with the recent bad weather.

Pulpit Rock at Portland Bill in Dorset during calmer conditions. The artificial stack of rock was left in the 1870s after a natural arch was cut away by quarrymen at the Bill Quarry on the famous headland and is a popular tourist attraction

‘Do not attempt to climb up or down rocks or cliffs unless you are trained and equipped to do so. If you get into difficulty, or spot someone else in trouble, call 999 and ask for the coastguard.’

Flood alerts were again issued for the Dorset coast from Lyme Regis to Portland this morning with residents urged to be aware of the risk at high tide.

Householders are still mopping up after Commercial Road next to Weymouth’s inner harbour was flooded on Wednesday night.

Condor Ferries cancelled sailings between Weymouth and the Channel Islands and the storms also left some communities, including Osmington, without power.

And the Met Office is predicting more storms for today with the possibility of hail overnight.

Dorset weatherman Bob Poots said Weymouth has already had a third of the rain that is expected to fall over the month of October.
