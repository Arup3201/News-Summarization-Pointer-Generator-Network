A huge blaze 'irreversibly' damaged a Parisian 17th century palace yesterday that once hosted to the likes of Voltaire and Chopin.

A large portion of Hotel Lambert's roof was burned away in the blaze just as a costly renovation was near completion.

The Qatari-owned mansion, which once belonged to the Rothschild dynasty, on the Ile Saint-Louis island on the River Seine was one of the most well-preserved private mansions in Paris.

France's culture minister said the 'fire caused very grave damage to an essential part of Paris's heritage'

It took more than six hours to control the blaze at the 17th century Hotel Lambert in Paris on Wednesday

Most of the historic Hotel Lambert's roof was destroyed in the blaze on Wednesday

The Qatari owned mansion was undergoing a controversial renovation when the fire started, which Paris politicians say is 'irreversible'

Its architect Louis Le Vau also designed the Palace of Versailles.

Paris Mayor Bernard Delanoe said: 'This is a setback for our historical heritage.'

Culture minister Aurelie Filippetti said: 'The fire has caused very grave damage to an essential part of Paris's heritage, some of which is irreversible', according to The Daily Telegraph.

More than 170 firefighters were called to the Unesco-listed building at around 1am and struggled to contain the blaze for six hours.

Televised images showed billowing grey 
smoke pouring out of the building's roof while helmeted firemen 
clambered across balconies trying to extinguish the blaze.

It is not yet known whether the mansion's precious murals by Charles Le Brun, who also designed the Hall of Mirrors at Versailles, were damaged.

The fire broke out in a hard-to-access area below the rooftop and 650 square metres of the roof was burned away.

More than 170 firefighters tackled the blaze that started at about 1am and took six hours to extinguish

It quickly spread through the empty house. Part of a central staircase and some façade masonry had also collapsed and rooms were damaged by water and smoke, fire brigade spokesman Pascal Le Testu said.

Art historians were evaluating the damage to works of art, which firefighters had tried to protect, Le Testu said.

They managed to prevent the blaze from spreading to surrounding buildings, which were evacuated as a precaution.

The damage came as workers were putting final touches to a renovation agreed between Paris authorities and the owner, a brother of Hamad bin Khalifa al-Thani, the former emir of Qatar.

The Hotel Lambert on Ile de Saint Louis was bought for about 80million euros in 2007

Plans to renovate the mansion were only finalised after a lengthy legal battle between al-Thani, who bought it in 2007 for a price that media estimated was up to €80million, and groups defending Paris monuments.

Opponents to the original renovation scheme objected to plans to build an underground garage, install an elevator and new bathrooms as well as redesigning its garden.

Built in the 1640s, the mansion was used 100 years later by writer and philosopher Voltaire.

The mansion was occupied for 150 years by the Polish Czartoryski family, who hosted the likes of Chopin, before it was sold it the French branch of the Rothschild family in 1975.
