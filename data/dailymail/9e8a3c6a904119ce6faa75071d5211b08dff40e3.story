When opening a village fair, Labour MP Helen Goodman thought she’d name drop a few local attractions to show how in-touch she is with her constituency.

But the politican was left embarrassed when she confused Ingleton, County Durham, for another village with the same name some 70 miles away.

Labour MP Helen Goodman described the village on the edge of her constituency as being famous for its beautiful waterfalls and deep caves during a speech at the Village Fayre and Classic Vehicle Show.

Red-faced: Labour MP for Bishop Auckland Helen Goodman confused Ingleton, County Durham, with its North Yorkshire namesake some 70 miles away. She made the mistake during a speech at a village fayre

Mistake: The Labour MP said Ingleton, County Durham, was famed for its beautiful waterfalls and caves. But she meant the North Yorkshire village  known for such landscapes as the Thornton Force, pictured

Beauty: The yorkshire village is partially located in the Yorkshire Dales National Park and is famed for its landscapes

But the Bishop Auckland MP had confused the tiny village with a population of just 400 with another on the edge of the Yorkshire Dales National Park.

Organisers from the Ingleton Village Fayre and Classic Vehicle Show were angered by Saturday's incident - and furiously said it was unlikely she would ever be invited back.

Today, Ms Goodman - who is accused of 
basing her speech from the Wikipedia entry for the other Ingleton - 
laughed off the mistake by calling it 'a simple accident'.

Nick Biggin, a local resident who works at The Black Horse pub in Ingleton said: 'I think it’s definitely arrogance.

'I only moved here in February and I have seen a lot of customers get mixed up with the villages.

'But as an MP for this constituency she should know better, you should know the area that you are serving.'

Neil Flowers, a member of the show’s organising committee said: 'She obviously does not know the place and whoever had done the research for the speech had not got it right.

'A lot of what she said is mentioned in the first part of the Wikipedia entry for that Ingleton.

'She spoke about our links with Sir Arthur Conan Doyle who was a regular visitor and got married at the other Ingleton, but doesn't mean much in this one.

'It didn’t make her look very good. I spoke to one or two people who had realised what she’d done.

'I think that if it had being pointed out to her it would have made it more embarrassing.

Attractions: St John's Church in County Durham, pictured, is one of the few attractions in the village - which is a short distance from Darlington and is on the edge of the MP's constituency

Impressive: St Marys Parish Church in the North Yorkshire village - which was visited regularly by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle as his mother lived in the region

'I don’t think that we’ll be asking Helen Goodman back to open the fair.'

Labour MP Ms Goodman said: 'I am sorry that I made the mistake. It was an honest accident on my behalf and some people pointed it out to me on the day.'

Ingleton in North Yorkshire is famous for its caves and people from all over the country flock there to go pot-holing.

Then other Ingleton is a small village just outside of Darlington in County Durham.
