Tony and Cherie Blair have come under fire after it emerged that their charities have been given nearly £1m from the American government’s foreign aid budget.

A US taxpayer watchdog has demanded an investigation because the grant was awarded whilst Mrs Blair’s good friend Hillary Clinton was Secretary of State and would have been responsible for the cash.

In December Mrs Blair’s woman’s charity was given a total of £405,000 from the US Agency for International Development (USAID).

Details have emerged that Tony and Cherie Blair have received nearly £1million from the American Government's foreign aid budget

The Clintons and Blairs are old friends. Concerns have been raised that their relationship could have had an impact on the grants

The money is on top of the £550,000 that the African Governance Initiative, one of Tony Blair’s charities, was given in 2011.

Both Mr and Mrs Blair have denied that their relationship with Mrs Clinton - forged when he was Prime Minister - had anything to do with the awards.

But around a month after the money was given to Mrs Blair’s charity Mrs Clinton stepped down from her post ahead of an expected Presidential run in the 2016 US election.

A spokesman for the National Taxpayers Union, a US campaign group, said: ‘More oversight and transparency is needed, if not a re-examination of the existence of these programmes.

‘USAID is under the Department of State’s direction and is vulnerable to shifting with the political winds, and has been loose with taxpayer dollars in the past.’ 

The £405,000 for the Cherie Blair Foundation for Women will go to help women in the African countries of Tanzania, Ghana and Rwanda, according to its latest accounts, which were published last week.

The money will supposedly be used for an ‘innovative project’ to launch businesses related to mobile telephones.

The grant has swelled the coffers at Mrs Blair’s charity which has an income of £1.8m a year and has £1.5m in the bank.

The good fortune marks a turnaround from when she launched it in 2008 and had to put in £250,000 of her own money as a loan.

Both Mr and Mrs Blair have denied that their relationship with Mrs Clinton - forged when he was Prime Minister - had anything to do with the awards.

A spokesman for the charity said: ‘The Cherie Blair Foundation for Women followed exactly the same application process as any other organisation applying for a grant from USAID.' 

Dr Maura O'Neill, USAID chief innovation officer, added: ‘USAID knew that if the world is to lift more people out of poverty so they could have a prosperous, healthy and just life, women are key.

‘We partnered with the foundation to close this gender-access gap and spur the growth of female entrepreneurs using mobile technologies.’ 

The development comes as Mrs Clinton has come under fire in recent weeks over her handling of the Benghazi scandal.

The row is over the death of US Ambassador to Libya Christopher Stevens, who died along with three other Americans when the Libyan embassy was stormed by militants.

The Obama administration initially claimed the attack was spontaneous and as a result of a protest but Republicans claim this was a cover-up because of inadequate security and that they knew all along it was terrorism.
