The women's world champion, Reanne Evans, has been given a place in the qualifying round's of this year's World Championship, World Snooker has announced.

The 29-year-old - the dominant player of the women's game with 10 successive world titles to her name - will head to Sheffield's Ponds Forge in April in a bid to qualify for the main event at the Crucible.

Evans will be one of 128 players to bid to join the game's top 16 in the tournament and she will need to win three matches in order to do so.

She would become the first women to compete in the World Championship if successful, having become the first woman to qualify for any ranking event last season when she got through to the main stage of the Wuxi Classic in China.

A new infrastructure introduced by the sport's governing body means that all players seeded outside the top 16 will join the 128, while invitations have been extended to former world champions no longer on the tour and amateur players.

As such, Evans has been invited to qualify, as have former champions Stephen Hendry and Steve Davis, while James Wattana has also been invited.

'So please (sic) to finally be able to say I've been given a place in this years world championship!!! 3 wins and I'll be at the crucible!!! Thanks to all my fans and sponsors,' Evans, a long-time campaigner for the women's game to be given greater prominence, wrote on her Facebook page.

Commenting on the news, Jason Ferguson, the chairman of the World Professional Billiards and Snooker Association, said: 'Reanne's achievements in the ladies game are incredible - to win 10 world titles in a row in any sport is a phenomenal record.

'She is a true sporting great and proved her ability to compete on the open professional tour when she reached the final stages of the Wuxi Classic in China.

'She deserves the chance to play in the World Championship and she will be aiming to become the first woman ever to play in the main event at the Crucible. Reanne is a trail-blazer for female players around the world.'

Were Evans to win even one of her qualifying matches it would carry prize money of £6,000 - a fee comfortably in excess of the tariff on offer for winning the women's World Championship.
