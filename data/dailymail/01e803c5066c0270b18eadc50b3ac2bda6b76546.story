In
complete contrast to his a/w 13 offering, which saw an effervescently red catwalk play host to a Sixties-inspired collection, Jasper Conran proved that this season is full of all things fresh, bold and white.

Sending his models down a graphic monochrome catwalk in clean-lined suits complete with Peter Pan collars, Jasper's s/s14 vision was one of perfect simplicity.

Speaking ahead of his show at the Saatchi Gallery, which saw Darcey Bussell and Katherine Kelly hold up the front row, Jasper described the collection as 'very fresh, clean, sort of pulled together and youthful.'

With its fresh palette of crisp whites set off by injections of navy and solid statements of lemon, Jasper's latest offering was streamlined in form, colour and pattern.

There was trompe l'oeil beadwork over sheer layers, whilst skirts were full and featured hand-blocked prints.

Jasper dressed-up his simple designs of pristine linen with dahlia lace, applique blooms and wirework leaves in textural white.

He told MailOnline: 'There's lots of colour, pretty colour! It's a - I use the word carefully - it's quite pretty, but not simpering, you know?'. He was right.

Holiday tones of pink grapefruit, sunny yellow, grass green and sea blue brightened up tailored shorts and simple sundresses, whilst graphic African prints were set against cooling whites.

Writing on Twitter, Darcey Bussell said of the collection: 'Stunning fresh Grecian silhouettes. Love the sundresses.'

Liz Jones was equally impressed, writing: 'Was it the rain, the fact it was Friday night, or disinterest that meant the Jasper Conran show was so poorly attended?

'No matter, it was a return to form with sugary linen shorts and dresses, lots of sheer white gauze over knife or box pleated skirts, graphic zig zag prints and sundresses that were very Grace Kelly circa To Catch A Thief.

'Less successful were the floaty kaftans, and the culottes.'

Jasper also had input into the beauty look.

'Beauty? Yes I do that, it's very very natural. It's very "beach", clean, very natural beauty. No heavy make-up, very soft,' he explained.

Speaking about the build-up to London Fashion Week, he said: 'It's been long hours, the week leading up to it is hell, I won't beat around the bush,

'I don't believe that anybody, any 
designer, will tell you that they look forward to this week.

'You wait 
with baited breathe, not with any sense of pleasure.

'It's jolly hard work and my favourite thing is when it's over. But I won't be going to bed, I will be celebrating by going out to dinner,' he said.

And it seemed like Jasper's hard work paid off, his pretty and ladlike s/s14 collection was met by deafening cheers.
