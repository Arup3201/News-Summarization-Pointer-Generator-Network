Where most parents would be embarrassed about knocking their child to the ground, this mother is more than happy to share her booty-grinding blunder with the world.

Summer Knowlden, from Utah, managed to film her derriere shaking to a beat of its own - and knocking her young daughter to the ground in the process.

While gyrating and booty grinding to T.I.â€™s Bring Em Out, Ms Knowlden's daughter runs towards her and is knocked backwards by Ms Knowlden's gyrating rear-end.

With this happening during Ms Knowlden's warm-up for an online dance-off for mothers, it would be interesting to see what happened during the dance-off itself.

After receiving positive feedback from friends and family, Ms Knowlden decided to upload the video to YouTube on Monday.

In a Facebook status update on Tuesday, she said: â€˜It sure makes me feel warm and fuzzy knowing I've made so many people literally laugh out loud!â€™

Despite not winning the competition, she has definitely achieved her goal of making people laugh out loud.
