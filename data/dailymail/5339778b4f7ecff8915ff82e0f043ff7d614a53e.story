Intervention: Ed Miliband has said he is prepared to get involved across British industry if he becomes Prime Minister

Ed Miliband has revealed he is prepared to launch state intervention across British industry if he becomes prime minister.

The Labour leader said he would intervene in markets across the economy if he thinks it is justified following his pledge to freeze energy bills if he wins the 2015 election.

Mr Miliband, who has boasted that he is ushering in a return of Socialism, said he wants to ‘make markets work in the public interest’.

Asked whether he is prepared to take more action in other markets, he told Radio 5 Live: ‘Yes, we will be doing more to show the difference a Labour government would make.

‘We will tackle the cost of living crisis and one of the ways we’ll do it is by making markets work in the public interest.’

The centrepiece of Mr Miliband’s speech at the Labour Party conference was to freeze energy prices for 20 months if he wins power.

But critics say the energy companies will simply ramp up prices as soon as the freeze is over, passing on even higher bills to customers.

The Labour leader is understood to be considering moves to force water companies to introduce ‘social tarrifs’ to help poorer families pay their bills. Mr Miliband said: ‘Labour was right in the 1990s to say we want dynamic markets but when competition fails, you’ve got to make sure that the rules are right.

‘What’s happening in energy is the rules aren’t working; the rules of the market aren’t working and that’s why we’ve said we’ll have the price freeze if we win the election until 2017. We’re willing to take on the strong, the powerful interests in our society, if it’s required to ensure that we tackle the cost of living crisis.’

The Tories will seek to recast themselves as the friend of cash strapped voters this week when Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin announces plans on Wednesday to help hard-pressed train commuters.

His department has already announced plans to ensure that ticket pricing is fairer, with a single costing half of a double ticket and plans for new flexible season tickets for part-time workers. The Tories are also examining plans to do more to tackle soaring water bills in a bid to win the initiative back from Labour.

The latest research shows that water bills with four of the biggest companies have risen by a third since 2007-08, while investment to stop leaks has fallen, according to the report by Tory MP Charlie Elphicke which has been sent to Chancellor George Osborne.

Energy firms are hoarding £1.2billion of customers’ money every year, allowing them to rake in millions in interest. More than half of British households pay bills by direct debit, meaning that charges are often overestimated in summer when usage use is lower, said regulator Ofgem.
