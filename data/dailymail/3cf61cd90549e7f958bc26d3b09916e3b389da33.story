This is the hilarious moment a gorilla had fun fooling around with a barrel at a zoo in Devon - before sticking his head inside it.

Kivu, 12, was photographed with the  tub - which used to hold slip for the pottery industry - at Paignton Zoo by mammals curator Neil Bemment.

He said: ‘I’m not sure if he was being Father Christmas coming down the chimney, but he certainly seemed to be enjoying himself.’

Entertainment: The zoo gives animals ‘environmental enrichment’ - scientifically designed to keep them mentally and physically stimulated

The zoo gives animals ‘environmental enrichment’ - things which are scientifically designed to keep them mentally and physically stimulated.

This can range from novel scents and hidden foods to plastic barrels. 

Kivu was born in November 2002 and came to Paignton Zoo in 2006.

Mr Bemment, 54, added: ‘Kivu is a very smart gorilla, he loves playing with the public through the window.

‘His favourite food is lettuce - he always eats his lettuce first.’

The charity’s bachelor group of Western lowland gorillas - a critically-endangered species - plays a role in international gorilla conservation.

It provides somewhere for young males to grow up in a social environment before moving on to form breeding groups in collections across Europe.

Paignton Zoo is currently home to five gorillas - silverback Pertinax, Kivu, Matadi, N’Dowe and Kiondo.
