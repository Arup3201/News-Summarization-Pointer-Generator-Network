Mark Sandell, 53, who was a senior BBC editor, is appealing against the BBC decision after a disciplinary panel recommended he be dismissed

A senior BBC editor and partner of radio presenter Victoria Derbyshire has been sacked following claims of bullying and sexual harassment and an investigation into his expenses.

Mark Sandell, editor of BBC radio’s World Have Your Say (WHYS), becomes the first executive to be dismissed in the wake of damaging bullying allegations revealed by The Mail on Sunday that have dogged the broadcaster for the past two years.

Mr Sandell left his wife of two years Fi Glover, a top BBC radio presenter, for Miss Derbyshire, also one of the Corporation’s stars, in 2002. The couple have two children.

He is appealing against the BBC decision, after a disciplinary panel recommended he be dismissed.

Bosses began an investigation into 53-year-old Mr Sandell, who has worked at the Corporation for 25 years, more than a year ago after claims he bullied and sexually harassed a member of staff. Separately, he was investigated over expenses.

It is understood he was told he was being dismissed earlier this month, days before the BBC announced it was axeing WHYS, one of its flagship shows abroad. 

Later the BBC announced she was to present a new daily news and current affairs programme on the BBC News Channel.

A friend of Mr Sandell said he was appealing. The senior BBC manager said: ‘Everyone has been shocked at the outcome. 

'The process is still ongoing and Mark is appealing on the grounds it is disproportionate and continues to have full support of his team.’ 

The source added that some at the Corporation felt that Mr Sandell was a ‘scapegoat’. 

Earlier this year, the BBC faced criticism after two high-profile bullying cases saw managers keep their jobs, despite multiple allegations being upheld against them. 

The decisions appeared to contradict the BBC’s supposed tough new stance on bullying, the result of a damning report into culture at the broadcaster by Dinah Rose QC.

Rod McKenzie was removed as head of Newsbeat, Radio 1’s news programme for youngsters, after being investigated for more than 30 complaints. 

He denied the claims, some of which were not upheld, but was given a final written warning and moved to head of development for local radio.

Jim Buchanan, a news manager, received a written warning after an investigation upheld claims that he bullied and intimidated staff. 

He was given the role of head of outside broadcasts for the First World War project on the same pay, leading some to believe he was in fact ‘promoted’.

WHYS, which airs on radio on the World Service and television on BBC World News, will end in 2015.

A BBC spokesman said: ‘We do not comment on staff matters.’

The BBC has been accused of ‘burying’ the cost of a £380,000 inquiry into sexual harassment and bullying, writes Miles Goslett. 

The Respect At Work Review was established in October 2012 in the wake of the Jimmy Savile scandal.

It was chaired by Dinah Rose QC, and more than 550 interviews were held with BBC employees by an external communications agency, Change Associates.

Results were published in a 60-page report in May 2013, but the BBC repeatedly refused to say how much the review cost until last week. On Monday, the Corporation slipped the figure out by inserting a sentence on to an existing BBC web page, without alerting anybody it had done so.

The inquiry came to ‘about £318,500’, according to the BBC. Adding VAT makes it £382,200.

There has been no breakdown of how much each party was paid, but the £382,200 was split between Ms Rose and Change Associates. 

Labour MP Margaret Hodge, chair of the Public Accounts Committee, said she was ‘surprised that the BBC appears to have learned no lessons from past mistakes about lack of transparency’.

Andy Silvester of the TaxPayers’ Alliance, which campaigns for lower taxes, said: ‘The BBC can’t be allowed to bury these costs.’

A BBC spokesman said: ‘Work to implement the review’s findings will continue but no further costs will be incurred.’
