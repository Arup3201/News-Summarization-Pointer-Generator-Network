How do you forget to be a chimp?

Well one ape at Twycross Zoo in Leicestershire seemed to have completely forgotten her animal ancestry after she was raised by humans.

Choppers, a 42-year-old ape, became one of the stars of the PG Tipps tea adverts in the 1970s.

The 'family' were dressed up in human clothes and made to perform sketches which were dubbed to create everyday, human scenarios.

In the series of adverts, the group would undertake furniture removals, DIY and even do housework all while enjoying a cup of tea.

Famous actors and comedians of the day, including Peter Sellers, Bruce Forsyth, Kenneth Williams and Bob Monkhouse, did the voiceovers.

But there could be hope yet for Choppers, the last surviving member of the Tipps clan, as she appeared to join a grooming circle in the chimpanzee circle at the zoo.

The Express reports she has found interacting with other apes hard but this incident appears to be a breakthrough.

The popular ads were loved by the public but the unnatural upbringing for the chimps changed their behaviour.

Zoologist Desmond Morris said he noticed the animal's lack of natural instinct when he saw them out in London with their handler Molly Badham.

The author of The Naked Ape said he did his best 'chimpanzee greeting' but the apes were baffled and shook his hand like a human.

He told the paper: 'I thought it was hilarious and Molly thought it was funny too – but it showed how far those chimps had gone to becoming humanised.'

As the closest living relatives to humans, chimps share 98 per cent of our DNA.

After her TV fame, Choppers retired to the Leicestershire zoo and ended up sharing a cage with co-star Louis until he died aged 37 last July.

Sharon Redrobe, chief executive of Twycross Zoo, said she tried to get Choppers to mix with other apes again after his death.

Over three years, the zoo carefully retrained her to be more chimp-like than human-like which was not an easy task, says Ms Redrobe.

Problems they had to overcome included Choppers' smiling which is a friendly human response but to a chimpanzee it shows agression.

She said it makes her 'cringe' to think of chimps being made to act as humans but people 'didn't know better'.
