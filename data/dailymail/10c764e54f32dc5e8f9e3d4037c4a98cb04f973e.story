A 36-year-old man has been treated in hospital for gastroenteritis - or 'stomach flu' - after apparently finding a rat's head in his bowl of chili at a Golden Corral restaurant.

Billy Wilson, a roofer, had reportedly just taken the first bite of his meal at the restaurant in Cape Corral, Florida, when he discovered the rodent.

He immediately spat it out of his mouth, before running to the bathroom and vomiting. After inspecting the object more closely, he found it had curly ears, gray fur and a protruding tooth.

A sickening find: Billy Wilson, 36, has been treated in hospital for gastroenteritis - or 'stomach flu' - after finding this apparent rat's head in his bowl of chili at a Golden Corral restaurant in Cape Corral, Florida

Disgusted: 'When I saw it, I just went into the bathroom and threw up. I was like "ugh". I just couldn't get the taste out of my mouth,' said Mr Wilson (pictured), who has rejected claims he could have made up the story

'The first bite I took out of [the chili] was a crunch, and at the time I was like, maybe you know sometimes you get a hard bean inside of chili,' he told MS News Now. 

'When I saw it, I just went into the bathroom and threw up. I was like "ugh". I just couldn't get the taste out of my mouth.'

Following his unwelcome discovery, Mr Wilson, who is 'scared of rats', said his friends called over the waitress, who then contacted the restaurant's stunned manager.

'He inspected and was like, "Wow that is a rat",' he said. 'So he took pictures of it, moved it around a little bit, took pictures in different angles. He was like me, he was horrified.'

Horrific: After inspecting the object closely, Mr Wilson found it had curly ears,  fur and a protruding tooth

Although the restaurant comped Mr Wilson and his party's meals, the diner was forced to attend Cape Coral Hospital the next day after feeling queasy.

There, he was treated for gastroenteritis and prescribed medications for nausea and muscle spasms, discharge documents show. 

Mr Wilson, who has now fully recovered, and his attorney Ray Racila dismissed claims that he could have made the story up, saying the restaurant's cameras had captured the entire incident.

Bad memories: Mr Wilson, pictured grimacing at his memory of the alleged incident, said he is now wondering whether other parts of the rat may have been in the chili. He has hired an attorney, Ray Racila

Mr Wilson added that he is now wondering whether other parts of the rat may have been in his chili.

And despite having been a regular at Golden Corral, he has vowed to never go back.  

The restaurant, which has neither confirmed nor denied the alleged incident, is investigating.
