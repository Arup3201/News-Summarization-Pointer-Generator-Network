Colleagues of a British teacher who was one of 118 people killed in the Air Algerie crash in Mali have told how they will miss their ‘caring’ friend.

Dave Morgan, 56, known affectionately as ‘Masher’, was on the flight when it came down in a remote area on Thursday.

Originally from Liverpool, he was a maths teacher at international schools.

His wife Evy is from Burkina Faso. She was not on the flight with him.

Hanri de Swardt, a fellow teacher from South Africa, said Mr Morgan and Evy were his ‘best friends’ when he worked with them for two years in Lusaka, Zambia.

Mr Swardt told The Mail on Sunday: ‘I’m still in so much shock – I can’t believe what happened. 

'He cared a lot about people close to him. He was really passionate about life and always available whenever someone was in need for help.’

118 people were killed when the plane crashed in Mali, while en route to the Algerian capital of Algiers 

David Cameron also paid tribute to Mr Morgan, saying he was 'deeply saddened' by his death 

Mr Swardt said that Mr Morgan had been due to start a new job in Singapore.

He earlier posted a picture of himself and Mr Morgan together on Facebook with the message: ‘Rest in peace Captain Dave Masher Morgan.’

David Cameron also paid tribute to Mr Morgan, saying he was ‘deeply saddened’ by his death.
