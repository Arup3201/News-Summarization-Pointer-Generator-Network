Ukrainian president Petro Poroshenko today said he is ready for 'total war' with Russia

Ukrainian president Petro Poroshenko today said he is ready for 'total war' against Russia as he claimed the crisis in eastern Europe is more serious than the threat from Islamic State. 

Kiev is convinced that Moscow is strengthening its troop presence on its borders and inside rebel-held areas, which the Kremlin has repeatedly denied.

As Putin returned from the G20 in Brisbane where he was under siege from Western leaders, Poroshenko claimed his army is now better prepared to fight to defend its territory than when the conflict began. 

'I am not afraid of a war with Russian troops,' he said.

'We are prepared for a scenario of total war.

'We don't want war, we want peace and we are fighting for European values.' 

He told Germany's Bild newspaper the unfolding drama on the edge of the EU was more critical than the Islamic State defiance.

'There are thousands of Russian soldiers, hundreds of tanks and heavy artillery in my country,' he insisted.

'This is one of the largest armies in the world, which threatens not only us, but also the whole of Europe.'

He added: 'More than anything we want peace, but we must at the moment face up to the worst-case scenario.'

The G20 had shown that Russia is 'completely isolated', he said, adding that Putin 'promises one thing and does the opposite the next day'.

In the latest fighting six Ukrainian soldiers and three police officers were killed in the past 24 hours, said security officials in Kiev.

A spokesman for the pro-Ukrainian side in occupied Lugansk region today claimed that the latest 'humanitarian convoy' from Russia contained no food or winter clothing but only ammunition.

'People are coming to Stanitsa from the other side (in rebel held areas), via the bridge over Sevetny Donets River and they are saying the last humanitarian convoy brought just bullets and shells,' said Yaroslav Galas.

'They loaded boxes with bullets, mines and shells. No medicine, food or warm clothes there. Just bullets and shells - they unloaded them and left.'

It was the latest convoy supposedly carrying food and winter clothing but the trucks were not open to Ukrainian or international inspection.

The disturbing claim could not be verified.

Despite his isolation at the G20, Putin was hailed for his diplomatic skills by the Russian media today.

The pro-Kremlin Izvestia daily praised Putin for his early exit claiming he behaved with 'sang-froid.'

As Putin, pictured, returned from the G20 in Brisbane where he was under siege from Western leaders, Poroshenko claimed his army is now better prepared 

He was 'met badly, put in a terrible hotel, assailed from every side with numerous reproaches about our country's behaviour in southeastern Ukraine... and finally put right on the edge of the joint photograph.'

Kommersant newspaper - owned by Arsenal FC shareholder Alisher Usmanov - claimed he 'managed to avoid the main thing: major scandals and continuing dialogue with its most implacable opponents.'  

Another prominent paper Vedomosti claimed that 'by leaving early, the Russian president avoided the need to react to the harsh statements of Western leaders at the end of the meeting' following his 'demonstratively cold reception'.

Putin claimed today that the West overreacted to his annexation of Crimea, claiming it was no different 'from what was done in Kosovo', which the US and Europe supported.

'I am deeply convinced that Russia did not commit any violations of international law,' he said.

'In Crimea, people did not just make a parliamentary decision, they held a referendum, and its results were simply stunning.'

Angela Merkel insisted that Putin would 'not prevail'.
