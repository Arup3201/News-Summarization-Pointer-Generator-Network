A remote Alaskan volcano continues to erupt, spewing lava and ash clouds - highlighting concerns over the closure of geological observation centers in the area.

The Alaska Volcano Observatory said a continuous cloud of ash, steam and gas from Pavlof Volcano has been seen 20,000 feet above sea level.

John Power, the U.S. Geological Survey scientist in charge at the observatory, estimates the lava fountain rose several hundred feet into the air.

Spewing lava: Fiery red molten rock can be seen erupting from Pavlof volcano, observed here from Cold Bay

Seismic instruments are picking up constant tremors from the eruption at Pavlof, located about 625 miles (1,000 kilometers) southwest of Anchorage. 

Residents of Cold Bay, 37 miles (60 kilometers) away, have reported seeing a glow from the summit.

Pavlof is among the most active volcanoes in the Aleutian arc, with nearly 40 known eruptions, according to the observatory.

It comes as scientists monitoring Alaska's volcanoes are forced to shut down stations that provide real-time tracking 
of eruptions and forgo repairs of seismic equipment amid ongoing federal
budget cuts - moves that could mean delays in getting vital information
to airline pilots and emergency planners.

The Alaska Volcano Observatory can 
no longer seismically monitor five volcanoes with real-time equipment to
detect imminent eruptions.

Such
equipment is especially important in helping pilots receive 
up-to-the-minute warnings about spewing ash that can cause engine 
failures and other problems.

Alaska has 52 active volcanoes, with many of them located on the Aleutians Islands along international air routes between Europe, North America and Asia.

Pavlof Volcano is one of several dozen volcanoes that make up the Aleutian Arc.

The arc stretches across the Alaskan Peninsula in the south-west of Alaska to north-eastern Siberia, 3,000km away.

It follows the line where the pacific tectonic plate meets the North American plate.

Alaska Airlines officials said the observatory, funded by the U.S. Geological Survey, provides a crucial service, including early warnings of seismic changes that may portend an impending eruption.

Monitors need to be operating all the time, not just during major eruptions, said Betty Bollert, an Alaska Airlines dispatcher. 

'I think the public gets kind of 
complacent when nothing exciting is happening and think, "Oh, why should
we throw money at that?"' said Bollert, who was on duty in 1989 when 
the Redoubt Volcano blew 115 miles from Anchorage. 

Following
that eruption, several aircraft experienced damage from ash - including
a Boeing 747-400 carrying 231 passengers that lost all four engines 
after flying into an ash cloud.

The
plane dropped more than two miles in five minutes before the crew was 
able to restart the engines and land safely in Anchorage.

Worldwide,
hundreds of flights are diverted each year because of volcanic 
activity. In 2010, an eruption in Iceland spread debris over Northern 
Europe, threatening most flight routes from the East Coast to Europe, 
and within Europe itself.

Early warning: The steam and the fresh lava flow could be seen on the north side of the volcano on Monday

The Alaska volcano monitoring system, first created in 1988, is intended to help pilots avoid such problems.

But it has regressed over the past few years because of shrinking finances, and now the across-the-board spending cuts known as sequestration are further squeezing operations.

For example, gone is a plan to install seismic monitors at Cleveland Volcano, a remote mountain on an uninhabited island in the Aleutians.

The volcano experienced a low-level eruption earlier this month that continues to discharge steam, gas and heat, although no ash clouds have been detected in the past week. 

'Because our budget has been declining for so long, we have no hope of actually addressing the Cleveland eruption in the way that it really should be,' said geophysicist John Power, the USGS scientist in charge at the Alaska Volcano Observatory.

Pavlof Volcano, 625 miles from Anchorage, does have seismic instruments, which picked up tremors signaling a possible eruption. Satellite imagery also showed a lot of heat in the mountain.

In Alaska, 32 volcanoes once had 200 working seismic instruments. Now 80 of those instruments have fallen into disrepair and can't be fixed due to the USGS budget cuts.

That means five of those volcanoes aren't monitored electronically at all, and the number could rise if more instruments go without maintenance. 

Cuts also have reduced the number of days helicopter crews can fly to repair equipment in remote locations, from 140 days in 2008 to 36. 

The observatory still uses satellite data, infrasound and reports from pilots and others to detect eruptions. But none of those offer real-time information.

Sound waves were picked up the Cleveland eruption, but it took 40 minutes for the data to reach scientists in Anchorage, 940 miles northeast of the volcano. 

These days, the observatory is operating on $4million annually, roughly half of its heyday budget.

Four other observatories in the U.S. - in Wyoming, California, Washington and Hawaii - also have faced cuts, leading to a reduction in lab research, studies of eruption histories and lava survey flights.

In Hawaii, lava flyovers of the Big Island's Kilauea volcano were reduced from once a week to once every two weeks.

It's still early in the federal downsizing process, and resources already are spread thin, said Tom Murray, chief of the five USGS observatories.

And while these types of cuts may not be immediately felt by the public - unlike the furloughs of air traffic controllers that caused flight delays nationwide - they are just as damaging, he said.

'The challenges with what we do is that it doesn't happen all the time,' he said. 'But when it does happen, then the ramifications can be very large.'
