A couple who were happily married for 63 years have been laid to rest together after they both passed away on the same day.

Bob, 85, and 82-year-old Barbara Pettis of Holdenville, Oklahoma, had both been battling health problems for several years when they died mere hours apart on June 30.

Their oldest son Clay, 59, told NewsOK that they were so close in life, it was no surprise that they ended up leaving the earth together.

'I don't believe in coincidences, and I 
didn't sit down and tell Dad that Mama was gone. But I'm sure he knew,' he said. 'Just knowing them, you wouldn't be surprised that Dad
 decided to check out, too.'

Per Barbara's wishes, she was cremated. Clay and his two siblings, Leslie and Jim, laid their parents to rest on July 2nd, placing their mother's urn in Bob's casket so they could be eternally together.

Clay - who, with his wife Jana, had been his parents' primary caretakers for two years - said it took him a while to fully realize just how special they were.

'We had something growing up that a lot of kids don't get. The thought of them divorcing was inconceivable to me,' he said. 'We had that kind of security with them that it never crossed our minds growing up.'

He added that even though they weren't 'all smoochy-woochy, touchy-wouchy,' the couple, who were both schoolteachers at the end of their careers, shared a unique bond

'In their voices and the way they looked at each other, you could see their love,' said Clay. 'Just in the little things.'

Prior to their passing, Bob had been recovering from a quadruple bypass, a stroke, pneumonia and a biking accident that shattered his pelvis. Barbara was bed-ridden.

Remembrance: The couple (pictured in the spring of 1951, before they got married) are survived by their three children, 11 grandchildren five great-grandchildren

At 6am on June 30, Clay got a call from his mother's nurse that she had passed away. He went to the hospital to be with his father, and at 8pm, Bob passed away, too.

Their lives were celebrated at a joint memorial service at Calvary Baptist Church in Holdenville, where they were both active members - Bob a deacon and song leader, and Barbara a pianist and organist.

The couple are survived by their three children, 11 grandchildren five great-grandchildren, with another great-grandkid due to be born this month.
