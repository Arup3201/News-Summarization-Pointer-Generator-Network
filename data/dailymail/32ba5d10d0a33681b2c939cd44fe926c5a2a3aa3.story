Mario Balotelli was the man Liverpool signed for European nights just like this against Basle.

However, the £16million man endured a torrid evening in Switzerland as the Reds sunk to a 1-0 defeat in their Champions League Group B encounter. 

Throughout the entire match the Italian international failed to touch the ball once inside the Basle penalty area - a bleak stat that sums up his dire performance.

Sportsmail covered the 24-year-old's movements inside St. Jakob-Park on Wednesday night.

3 mins: Good turn and pass to release Lazar Markovic down the right who crosses towards the far post. Raheem Sterling's shot hits the upright but finishes the rebound, to then be correctly flagged for offside.

18 mins: Italian international wins a free-kick spinning Fabian Schar before being clipped on the heels by the centre-back out on the right touchline.

24 mins: Forward wins his second free-kick in the corner, holding the ball up well before being fouled by Geoffroy Serey Die.

28 mins: The good and bad of Balotelli is summed up in this brief passage of play. The good?  He intercepts a loose pass on the half-way line. The bad? Instead of keeping possession he tries to go past two players and is tackled instead. Basel break and create an opportunity to score.

29 mins: Italian international is caught offside when played in by Steven Gerrard, showing little attempt to bend his run to try and stay onside.

40 mins: Balotelli's high-profile temperament is in full force when he moans at Sterling for shooting, instead of passing to him, when he was perfectly entitled too just outside the Basle box.

43 mins: The 24-year-old wins another free-kick for his team, this time beautifully nutmegging  Schar in the corner before being fouled.

H/T verdict: Balotelli has been fairly anonymous for Brendan Rodgers' side despite winning a number of fouls. His performance can be summed up by the fact he failed to touch the ball once inside the Basle penalty area.

48 mins: First real public display of frustration from Balotelli is shown when he unceremoniously fouls Serey Die and is penalised by referee Jonas Eriksson.

60 mins - He's scored a few a scorching free-kicks in his time and Balotelli sees his blistering 35-yard strike saved by goalkeeper Tomas Vaclik only for Markovic to miss the rebound.

63 mins: Balotelli tries his luck again from distance, with his confidence increasing after his earlier free-kick it seems, this time ballooning an audacious effort miles over that is more of a danger to the crowd than it ever was to Vaclik.

70 mins: Balotelli is booked for a light off-the-ball 'slap' on Taulant Xhaka - a needless caution but the frustrations of the maverick forward continue to grow.

75 mins: The big striker is involved in a neat move that almost sees Liverpool equalise. Adam Lallana plays a clever one-two with the forward before releasing Sterling who's first touch lets him down when through on goal.

83 mins: Liverpool paid £16million for Balotelli from AC Milan this summer and a snippet of his skill is demonstrated as he deliciously controls the ball before entailing in a few kick-ups while shielding himself from surrounding defenders. His dribbling prowess is then followed up by winning a free-kick for his side moments later, 25-yards out after being fouled.

88 mins: Balotelli finds the back of the net for Liverpool but is flagged offside by the linesman, after failing to time his run when played through by Gerrard. 

F/T verdict: An overall poor performance from the Italy international. The fact he registered ZERO touches inside the Basle penalty box says it all. For Liverpool to go far in this competition they need their £16million striker to vastly improve - especially as their next two games in Group B are against defending champions Real Madrid.
