Shocking: Nearly a quarter of girls in care become teenage mothers, a report reveals today

Nearly a quarter of girls in care become teenage mothers, a shocking report reveals today.

Around 1,000 girls - some 22 per cent of the total - have children when they themselves are teenagers, three times the national average.

The Centre for Social Justice, the think tank set up by Iain Duncan Smith, paints a disturbing picture of a struggling care system shamefully betraying many of its vulnerable charges.

Freedom of information requests show that more than 4,000 children go missing from care each year - and that 36 per cent of care leavers are not in education, employment or training by the age of 19.

The CSJ warns of an inter-generational cycle of disadvantage it says is running through England’s care system. It has found that at least one in ten care leavers aged 16 to 21 who are parents have gone on to have a child of their own taken into care in the last year.

'When you take children into care you have a unique opportunity to break the cycle of disadvantage. Too often this isn’t happening,' said Alex Burghart, the CSJ's policy director.

'Many parts of the care system are in tatters and we desperately need to rescue it to protect our most vulnerable children.'

The report calls on the Government to create 'scorecards' to name and shame councils failing children in care.

It also says care leavers should be given a step up in life by funding £2,000 apprenticeship bursaries.

Local authorities spend £2.5 billion a year supporting children in foster and residential care - a real terms increase of three per cent since the coalition came to power.

The number of children in care has risen to almost 70,000 - its highest level for nearly 20 years, partly as a result of a rise in the number being removed from their parents following the 'Baby P' scandal in 2007. The state spends more each year per child - on average around £36,500 - than it costs to send a child to Eton.

But following a major investigation into the care system, the CSJ concludes many local authorities are failing in their duty to support young people or give them any understanding of healthy and positive relationships.

The figures on teenage parenting represent just one example of a system struggling to look after those in care, the report says.

Those leaving care are now twice as likely not to be in education, employment or training (NEET) at the age of 19 than the rest of the population.

Other symptoms of a system at breaking point include new figures showing that thousands of vulnerable children go missing from England’s care system on a regular basis.

Local authorities in England reported 252 cases where children have gone missing from care for more than 28 days in the last year. There were 4,452 cases of children missing for more than a day and 707 for more than a week. Only two-thirds of local authorities responded to requests for details under freedom of information law, so the real number will be higher still.

Mr Burghart added: 'If this many children were going missing from their families it would spark national outrage.

'Children in the care system need proper support and protection. We need to learn the lessons of what can happen to children who are not cared for - as we saw in Rotherham.'

Almost one-third of children in care leave school with no GCSEs and just six per cent do well enough to go to university. Almost four in every ten prisoners under the age of 21 has been in care while growing up.

A series of scandals involving children being abused while supposedly in the care of the state - notably in north Wales - has heightened concerns about the failings of the system.

Teams supporting young people leaving care are often overstretched, the report finds, with an average caseload of a personal adviser in some areas of 49 young people.

The CSJ recommends introducing league tables to highlight which local authorities are failing children and young people from care.

It suggests overhauling the system and introducing new support networks for care leavers, based on more successful schemes in the US.

Researchers also say there is a financial imbalance between care leavers who take up apprenticeships and those who go to university. The CSJ says apprenticies should get the same state-funded bursary of £2,000 as those who study for a degree.
