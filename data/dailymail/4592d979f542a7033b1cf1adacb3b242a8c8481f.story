A man, who was brutally bashed on a train after stepping in to defend two women, speaks out about how his actions were intended to prevent any violence from erupting.

'Paul', as he has been identified, was on the train from Sydney Olympic Park to Central after the Penrith-Canterbury semi-final when he saw an argument between two women and two men.

Deciding to go over and calm things down before the situation got out of control, he came away from trying to keep the peace with a broken nose, two black eyes and 24 stitches to a gash on his head and lip.

The 48-year-old was covered in blood after a vicious attack from two men. The culprits fled at Sydney's Central Station.

'I thought I'd just ask the fellas to leave it alone and walk away, to just quieten everything down,' Paul told 9NEWS.

'There were innocent people on the train and these people were getting quite overheated. 

'I didn't want it to escalate to the stage where there was any violence.' 

One of the men moved to sit down in a different part of the train, but his friend starting throwing punches.

'Loads of punches were being thrown, one of the guys pinned my arms to my side while the other one threw punches,' Paul said.

He managed to headbutt the attacker - the 48-year-old's only option without the use of his arms. 

Emergency services were called to the scene and paramedics took Paul to St Vincent's Hospital

The culprits fled from Central railway station, where paramedics came to Paul's aid. 

Police confirm that at 11.50pm, the victim was travelling on a city-bound train from Olympic Park with a man and two women after the Bulldogs-Panthers clash. 

Two men boarded the train at Strathfield Station and struck up a conversation with the group.

'By the time the train reached Redfern, the 48-year-old man was concerned the conversation had become offensive,' said a NSW Police spokesperson. 

'He approached the other two men in an attempt to de-escalate matters.' 

Witnesses say Paul was assaulted between Redfern Station and Central Station, at which point all parties left the train.

Police are yet to identify the perpetrators and are continuing inquiries into the alleged assault.

They have released descriptions of the two men to the public. 

'The first is described as being of Caucasian appearance and aged 25 to 30 years. When he was last seen, the male was wearing a black shirt.

'The second man is described as being of Caucasian appearance, with a ginger beard, of a medium build, and aged in his thirties. 

'He was last seen wearing a black shirt with coloured bands around the midsection.'

Police did not confirm reports that the two men were Penrith Panthers supporters. 

Anyone with information is encouraged to contact Crimestoppers.
