See inside one of Australia’s finest residential properties, a mansion in Toorak, south-east Melbourne, with a $25 million asking price but was sold at a massive discount.

The Mining speculator Socrates Vasiliades, an international commodities trader, took six years to build the compelling three level mansion, which is set upon 2100 square metres at 3 Towers Road.

With 22 rooms, a lift, home theatre, gym, pool, and basement parking, it came with a record-setting $30 million hopes back in 2011, according to Property Observer.

The luxurious property had tradespeople from around the world who flown in to work on the mansion during its six-year construction.

But the Melbourne-born businessman who waited for his home to build, famously lived there for six days before moving out.

Shortly after the seventh day, Mr Vasiliades moved his family to Europe and listed it on the market for three years from April 2011. 

The property  features six bedrooms, two studies, Roman columns and a variety of living and dining zones off a spectacular entrance hall and corridor.

The north-facing backyard offers a swimming pool built into a manicured garden with park-like surrounds in one Melbourne's most revered residential locations.

Featuring a suite of amenities associated with the most discerning of lifestyles, the magnificent estate presents a rare opportunity to secure what is destined to become one of Australia's most significant generational holdings.

The mining speculator's home was up for sale for $30 million back in May 2011 and refused an offer of $25 million that year. 

Property Observer reports the mansion was quietly sold to Sarah Lew for an undisclosed price but Domain claims sources suggest that the sale figure could have been as low as $18.7 million.
