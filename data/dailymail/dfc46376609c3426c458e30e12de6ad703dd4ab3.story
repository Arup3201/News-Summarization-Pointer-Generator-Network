A Meijer store employee in Gaylord, Michigan was recently fired for helping put out a fire in the store's parking lot.

David Bowers was greeting customers at the front of the store last month when a shopper came up to him, saying his car was on fire

So Mr Bowers grabbed a fire extinguisher and left his post to put out the flames. Soon after he returned to his positions and continued his work.

Good Samaritan sacked: David Bowers was fired as a greeter from a Meijer store in Michigan when he left his post at the front of the store to help a customer put out a fire in the parking lot

Breaking the rules? Store management let Mr Bowers go for not adhering to company policy. Above, a picture of the torched car Mr Bowers helped save

But it wasn't long before he was called into the store director's office where he was told he was being put on suspension.

'The one supervisor  told me that my heart was in the right place, but my brain wasn't' Mr Bowers told UpNorthLive.

Mr Bowers was officially fired later that week for 'not following company policy'.

'I thought that was what we were supposed to do. You know, you have somebody that is in need, don't you help them? But I guess not,' Mr Bowers said. 

Mr Bowers admits that he was put on suspension once before - for chasing a shoplifter out of the store. Since he was let go, Mr Bowers has been unable to find another job.

Responding to criticism that Mr Bowers shouldn't have been fired, the company issued a statement to MLive.com, saying it 'was not a random decision'.

'We have well-established safety procedures for emergency situations and we train all team members on those procedures. These procedures help ensure the safety of everyone – both customers and team members, and our team members know there are consequences when they don’t follow them.'

One customer especially peeved about Mr Bower's termination is the shopper he helped that day, Ken Kuzon.

He says his car would have completely burned out if Mr Bowers didn't come to his aid.

'I just think it's ridiculous. Why should you be penalized for being a Good Samaritan?' Kuzon asked.

And now the situation is turning into a PR nightmare for the company, as patrons have been posting on the store's Facebook page in protest and calling for Mr Bowers to get his job back.

'Last night I pulled into your Gaylord Meijer's parking lot to do my weekly shopping. I thought about how David Bowers was always there to greet me and my 4-year-old and cheer her on while she played the claw game at your entrance,' wrote Pamela LaGuttata. 'Although I shop there almost exclusively, I reconsidered my decision to support your store and drove to Wal-Mart. I hope that you will reconsider your decision in the firing of a Good Samaritan.'

Patron Randy Klepper said he read about the story in the local paper and questions how the store's founder, the late Frederik Meijer, would have dealt with the same situation.

'It tells me not to ever get hit by a car or have a heart attack in their parking lot. It would evidently be against company policy to get any help from a employee. Meijer should be ashamed for not wanting to have their staff help out in those type of situation...HE SHOULD GET HIS JOB BACK,' Mr Klepper wrote.
