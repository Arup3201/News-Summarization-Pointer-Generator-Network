Roberto Martinez insists Everton’s integrity should not be questioned as he promised Liverpool they will be going all out to torpedo Manchester City’s title hopes.

There has been an unusual atmosphere around Merseyside building up to tomorrow’s showdown at Goodison Park, as Liverpool supporters are praying for the home win that would re-hand them the initiative in the race for the Barclays Premier League.

Many Evertonians, however, have indicated they would be able to stomach a first home defeat to City in five years as it would prove detrimental to Liverpool’s hopes of becoming domestic champions for the first time since 1990.

Focus: Roberto Martinez insists his Everton side will be fully committed to beating Manchester City on Saturday

Martinez, who is surrounded by a 
backroom staff full of devout Evertonians, has described the idea of 
fans wanting their own team to lose as “banter” but has given an 
assurance to their neighbours that his side will not lie down.

Everton,
 after all, still have an outside chance of finishing in the top four 
and he believes two victories over Manuel Pellegrini's side and Hull 
City would put pressure on Arsenal, which is why Martinez can say with 
certainty that he will be sending his players out to win.

'There
 is not even a question mark about us,' said Martinez. 'For us it means 
everything to win this game in terms of the overall season. I can 
understand the banter between the fans but Liverpool can be assured that
 Goodison will be the toughest place for Manchester City to travel this 
season, that is for sure.

'We
 need to get the six points, that's vital for us. I don't see it as a 
serious accusation. I think it is more football rivalry, a bit of 
banter, which I can understand. I would be hurt or insulted if we had 
nothing to play for and even then our professionalism was in doubt but 
that is not even in question now.

'We
 have got so much to play for. I still think it would be a major ending 
to the season if we were to finish with 75 points. Whatever people might
 say on the outside, I don't take it seriously. We have got too much to 
fight for.'

Each place in 
the Barclays Premier League is worth £1.25million in prize money, which 
is revenue Everton do not want to lose by falling down the table. There 
would also be the side effect of having to start next season in late 
July if they finished sixth, as they would go into the Europa League 
qualifiers.

'The money you 
get for each position is important but it's not just that,' said 
Martinez. 'As a professional group and a team we represent Everton. That
 means we represent every single player that has played for Everton in 
the past and our work for the last ten months.

'You wouldn't come in now and not give your all to finish as good as you can.'

Controversial: Roberto Martinez has been criticised for his use of the loan system in shaping his team

This might be new territory as a manager but, during his playing career, he experienced how unusual cross-city enmity can be.

'My
 debut with Real Zaragoza was against Atletico Madrid in 1993,' he 
recalled. 'It was the last game of the season. Real Madrid were playing 
away at Tenerife and Real Madrid had to win to win the league and in 
order for Atletico Madrid to get into Europe automatically.

'Real
 Madrid were losing and the Atletico crowd was going crazy, even though 
that meant they were out of Europe.The line they used after the game was
 “We would rather lose one eye as long as the neighbours lose two" - I 
couldn't understand it.'
