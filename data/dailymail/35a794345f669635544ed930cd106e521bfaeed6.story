General Sir Richard Shirreff is the country's third highest ranking officer

One of Britain's top generals has branded the planned cuts to the armed forces as 'one hell of a risk'.

By 2020, the Army will have been slashed by a fifth - from 102,000 to 82,000 troops - and will be far more reliant on reserves.

General Sir Richard Shirreff, the Army's third most senior officer, has warned that the shifts will make the country far weaker on the world stage.

In an interview with the Sunday Times, the general said defence cuts had 
'hollowed out' the armed forces, particularly the Royal Navy, which has
 been 'cut to the bone' and left unable to take part in Nato maritime 
operations.

Sir Richard, who is leaving the Army is August, said the 'jury is out still' on plans to make up for smaller standing forces by expanding the Army Reserve - formerly the Territorial Army - from 19,000 to 30,000 troops.

He said it would need a 'complete 
shift in culture' and support from the wider public and employers if it 
is to succeed, saying: 'The nation needs to get behind this. It's not
 just the armed forces - this is everybody's business.'

The general stepped down as Nato's deputy supreme commander on Friday, a role in which he was coordinating the organisation's response to Russia's takeover of the Crimea.

He said Russian aggression made it more important for the UK to protect its defence budget, even if that meant other departments suffered.

The general claimed countries must protect defence budgets to deter Vladimir Putin from further aggression

He
 said: 'We all support the efforts to get the deficit down but it is all
 about priorities. What really matters? Well, the first duty of 
government is to protect the nation. Defence is really, really 
important.

Sir Richard with David Cameron in 2006. The general has warned that cuts are undermining the country's armed forces

'And the 
electorate need to understand there is no point in having hospitals and 
schools and welfare unless the country is safe.'

Sir
 Richard admitted that those implementing the changes had 'made a pretty
 good fist of a very difficult hand of cards', but said: 'I wouldn't 
want to let anybody think that I think that Army 2020 is good news, it's
 not.

'The sort of defence cuts we have seen... have really hollowed out the British armed forces and I think that people need to sit up and recognise that.'

The general claimed the changes to the Navy were the most pressing concern, as they has left the UK without an operational aircraft carrier until 2020 and a fleet of just 19 frigates and destroyers.

He said: 'A hollowed-out navy means you can't project power. I've heard this said in the Ministry of Defence: "The yardstick by which we measure ourselves is our ability to punch above our weight". You can't do that now. By that yardstick, therefore, we're failing.'

The Commons Defence Committee this week said the crisis in Ukraine underlined the continuing threat of state-on-state conflict, warning that Britain's national security depended upon its ability to maintain a 'credible deterrent' against a full range threats from cyber attack to a nuclear strike.

Further reductions in the size of the UK's conventional forces could ultimately call into question the effectiveness of the Trident nuclear deterrent, it said.
