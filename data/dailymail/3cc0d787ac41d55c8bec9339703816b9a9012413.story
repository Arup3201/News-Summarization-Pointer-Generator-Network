Hurt up: Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel has revealed how he cut his face

Cabinet incident: It turns out Sec. Hagel cut himself on the side of a cabinet door

'I had an incident with a cabinet door in the kitchen,' he revealed during a press briefing. 

'I know that’s not an exciting story.'

He did not elaborate much beyond that, adding, 'I engaged the corner of a cabinet in my kitchen, and it didn’t turn out well for me.' 

Brief and to the point: 'I know that’s not an exciting story,' he said when telling reporters

Sec. Hagel had more important matters to discuss Friday, as he admitted that three U.S. nuclear missile bases in North Dakota, Wyoming and Montana were so badly managed that they had to share a wrench used to tighten warheads to the business end of Minuteman 3 missile.

He is now ordering changes in how this country's nuclear arsenal is managed.

And possibly waging a silent war at home with one pesky cabinet.
