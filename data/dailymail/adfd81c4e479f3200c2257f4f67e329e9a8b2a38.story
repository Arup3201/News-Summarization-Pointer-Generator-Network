Resignation: A4e hit the headlines last year when it emerged that firm's founder Emma Harrison paid herself an £8.6million dividend in 2011

Nine former staff at controversial welfare-to-work firm A4e were charged with fraud last night over offences relating to taxpayer-funded employment schemes.

The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) said six women and three men had been charged with a total of 60 offences, including conspiracy to defraud, multiple counts of forgery, and making and possessing articles for use in fraud.

All nine worked for A4e, which is paid more than £200million a year by the Government, mostly to deliver welfare-to-work and training programmes.

The firm is a prime contractor on the Government's flagship £5billion Work Programme employment scheme.

The nine people charged include one contract manager, seven recruiters and an administrator.

They are alleged to have wrongly claimed payments for people who were not their clients and for finding jobs for people who were in fact still unemployed. They will appear before Slough magistrates’ court next month.

The charges follow a high-profile investigation by Thames Valley Police’s economic crime unit. Those charged worked at three A4e offices across the south east of England.

The charges relate to the ‘Inspire to Aspire’ scheme which is designed to deliver ‘motivation and training’ and help people find a job.

Sue Patten, head of fraud at the CPS, said: ‘It is alleged that they forged documentation to support fraudulent claims to the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) for reward payments which, under the terms of the contract, were paid out when the scheme successfully placed individuals in employment.

‘It is alleged that many of the reward payments related either to people who never attended A4e or to clients whom A4e had not successfully placed in employment.

‘The contract was to deliver motivation and training and to assist people to find employment.’

The charges cover the four-year period February 2009 to February this year.

When the police investigation first became public in March last year, both A4e and the DWP insisted that all the allegations related to historic welfare-to-work programmes.

A4e hit the headlines last year when it emerged that firm’s founder Emma Harrison paid herself an £8.6million dividend in 2011.

Following a public outcry, Mrs Harrison resigned as the Prime Minister’s ‘back-to-work’ tsar and also quit as chairman of A4e, in which she retains an 85 per cent shareholding.

In a separate development yesterday the DWP said A4e would receive 5 per cent fewer clients on the Work Programme in the East Midlands, South Yorkshire and Merseyside as a penalty for poor performance.

In a statement last night A4e said it would not tolerate fraud and was co-operating fully with the police investigation.

The company said: ‘The incidents all relate to old paper-based contracts which used systems that have since been replaced.’

A4e’s chief executive Andrew Dutton said: ‘There is no place for dishonesty or wrongdoing at A4e, which is the most rigorously audited company in its sector.’

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
