If you thought the recent bad weather was just a storm in a teacup, think again - it could dump some nasty news on your plate, too.

The cost of a fish supper could jump by as much as 10 per cent after trawlers were unable to go out to sea in the storms, a report has claimed.

The shortage has pushed up wholesale prices of popular white fish such as haddock, plaice and whiting to one and a half times what they were this time last year.

Any bites? A fisherman braves storms in Cleveleys, Lancashire, earlier this month. A report by trade magazine The Grocer has said prices of popular white fish are up by more than 50 per cent on this time last year

Research by trade magazine The Grocer showed haddock has leaped in price to £1,474 a tonne (up 54 per cent), plaice has risen to £1,246 (51 per cent) and whiting is now £1,675 (44 per cent).

The cost of whiting has risen 37 per cent over the last month alone, according to the report, with plaice up 11 per cent.

The government body Seafish, set up to ensure quality of the fish that ends up on our plates, said most of the rise will be absorbed by business owners until the price drops back to normal levels.

But the National Federation of Fishmongers told the Mirror customers could expect to see a rise of about 10 per cent.

The federation's president Jonathan Adams told the newspaper: 'The price of fish is always affected by the weather, but when it goes up, consumers must expect to pay as much as 10 per cent more.'

British staple: Once a cheap and cheerful Friday night supper, a trip to the chippy can hit you in the pocket

Once a cheap and cheerful Friday night
 takeaway, the cost of cod and chips for a family of four has risen to 
well over £25 in some areas.

Haddock is particularly affected because of reduced quotas, according to The Grocer.

Bad weather in Norway has also taken its toll, with farmed salmon up 46 per cent since this time last year.

The problem was caused by cold weather disrupting supply and an increased demand over Christmas.
