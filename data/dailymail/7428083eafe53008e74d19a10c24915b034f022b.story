The Queen and Prince Philip looked relaxed as they attended a church service at St Mary Magdalene Church on the royal Sandringham estate in Norfolk today.

Her Majesty wore a sky blue wool coat with a royal blue collar and matching pockets and trim,  topping off the look with a blue hat.

Prince Philip, wearing a dark grey suit and long brown overcoat, strolled to church with friends.

The Queen, 88, wore a diamond brooch on her coat and pearl earrings and was driven away from the church after the ceremony.

Members of the royal family traditionally gather at Sandringham for Christmas and attend St Mary Magdalene, which dates back to the 16th century.

Last year the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge attended the formal Christmas Eve celebrations on the house that has been a private home to the royal family since Queen Victoria bought it in 1862. 

Prince William and Kate also attended the traditional Christmas morning service at St Mary Magdalene.  

Sophie Wessex cut an elegant figure when she joined Prince Philip, 93, and Prince Charles and greeted well-wishes at the church on 28 December.

The coming year is set to be a busy one for the monarch as she and Prince Philip are set to tour Germany in the summer.  

Last week Buckingham Palace said in a short statement: 'The Queen, accompanied by the Duke of Edinburgh, will make a state visit to the Federal Republic of Germany from 24 to 26 June.

'Her Majesty and His Royal Highness are visiting at the invitation of the President of the Federal Republic of Germany, Joachim Gauck.' 

The tour will be the first international visit undertaken by the monarch since the state visit to France for the 70th anniversary of the D-Day Landings last year.

Kate Middleton and Prince William quietly celebrated her 33rd birthday on Friday at home with their son Prince George.
