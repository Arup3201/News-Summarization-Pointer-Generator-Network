England's World Cup flops have not only upset their millions of fans, they have left sponsors and advertisers red-faced.

Companies have poured  millions into advertising with England and their players only to see Roy Hodgson’s side exit within eight days.

It has left some with the embarrassment of having  positive adverts still running on television, completely at odds with the national mood.

VIDEO: Scroll down to see some of England's World Cup adverts

Costly advert: Mars paid big money to get Steven Gerrard, Danny Welbeck and Daniel Sturridge for their campaign

Just a dream: Gerrard scores a volley after a clever free-kick in the ad - something he couldn't repeat in Brazil

Not so fresh: Adverts which were popular before the World Cup may now be attracting negative attention

Steve Martin, chief executive of advertising and PR agency M&C Saatchi Sport & Entertainment, said: ‘What is quite startling is those brands still running ads and not reacting to what’s happened on the pitch.

'That can be detrimental to the brand. It’s a bit like people still driving around with England flags on their car as if they’re still in the tournament.

‘You want people having positive conversations about your brand, not people saying, “Why is that ad still running?”

‘It’s hard to put a value on how much England going out has cost them. The advertisers would have paid for the space and creating the advert. That could potentially be devalued.

‘England going out so early will cut in half potential advertising time. Sponsors and advertisers were expecting them to get to the quarter-finals.’

Shaving but not saving: Joe Hart featured in several adverts but couldn't prevent England going out

The end: Luis Suarez's second strike pushed England to the brink before Costa Rica sealed their fate

The humiliated England squad leave Brazil tonight after their woeful World Cup with no bonus payments for their abject failure.

The players’ financial reward for the tournament was heavily linked to progress and they would have pocketed £350,000 each if they had lifted the World Cup.

The team, as they do for all internationals, will donate their match fees to charity.

The cost for official England team sponsors runs into millions. Vauxhall — who have featured captain Steven  Gerrard, Wayne Rooney and Joe Hart — pay £5million per year and Mars — with Gerrard, Danny Welbeck and Daniel Sturridge — £4m per year to be official sponsors.

Neither is extending World Cup advertising beyond the group stage. Vauxhall’s even ended after England’s defeat to Uruguay on Thursday when they chose not to continue.

One industry source said: ‘It is the official England team sponsors who are losing out the most.’

For unofficial sponsors, who have struck individual deals with players, the cost can still be up to £150,000 for their time.

Sturridge likes doing things his way, we’re told by Subway. Hart is ready to make it count, according to Head and Shoulders, while he has rarely been off our screens in adverts for Doritos and Gillette as well. Wayne Rooney is representing Samsung and Jack Wilshere Pepsi.

Meanwhile, Sainsbury’s have reduced their Three Lions World Cup merchandise by 70 per cent. Three Lions mugs are now available at £1.19. England flags are now selling at half price for just 49p.

Even World Cup teddy bears have had their price slashed in half to £4.99 and wrist bands are going for just 50p.
