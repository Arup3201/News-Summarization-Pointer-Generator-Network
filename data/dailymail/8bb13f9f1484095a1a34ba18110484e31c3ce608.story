A year after the dance became a global phenomenon, a group of competitors have taken part in the second UK National Twerking Championships.

Thirteen dancers wowed crowds with their eye-popping moves at the competition held in north London last night. 

The women bounced and jiggled their way through five rounds in a bid to win first place and a chance to dance on stage with twerking sensation Nicki Minaj.

The National Twerking Championships were held in London last night and attracted a crowd of almost 500

The first round, Freestyle, allows dancers to move around the stage in a solo performance or with a partner.

The 45-second segment to a song of their choice is where dancers can show off their 'tricks' said the event's organiser, Harry Anthony of Jump Off TV. 

'They can do whatever they want, they can put choreography together or demonstrate tricks,' he said. 

Next is the 'jiggle and pop round' - formerly known as the jelly round - during which competitors have to shake their behinds without moving their feet. 

'There are ways when you just kind of curl your knees in and your bum will shake, some girls can pop each cheek to the rhythm.'

'It's very technical,' Mr Anthony added. 

Thirteen dancers took part in the competition, twerking their way through five different themed rounds

Place your hands on your hips, with your feet turned out and your knees over your toes.

To go forward, press your thumbs into your butt bone and move forward.

To go back, the fingers pull back on the hip bone.

Squat so that the only part of your body you can move is the hip section.

For a more pronounced twerk, rest the hands on the knees, with the wrists facing out.

Then up the tempo and shake the butt.

The upside down round follows and is one of the most popular parts of the competition with dancers propping themselves up against the wall in a handstand to twerk.

The fourth round, domination, sees the girls 'dominate' a partner with their twerking abilities. 

After tallying up scores, the best six girls went on to compete in the final round, the Nicki Minaj Anaconda round. 

To the background of the singer's new hit, the dancers have a 30 seconds to come up with their own choreography. 

Jemini, a 21-year-old  dance hall performer, was crowned the winner and took home £1,000 in cash.

She will perform with the singer when she next visits the UK. 

Mr Anthony, who organised last year's sold out event, said he'd noticed a spike in interest in the dance over the past 12 months.  

'We had much more interest from people sending videos. I like to compare it to planking.

The event's organiser said more people were comfortable with the style of dance than ever before 

Nicki Minaj is known for her twerking skills 

'People don't do it anymore because it was an internet fad and people thought twerking was going to be that too because of Miley Cyrus. 

'But because it is actually a dance and requires skill  people have embraced it. 

'I don't think it'll ever go away. It's acceptable in mainstream culture. 

'What we saw last year was the fad of twerking celebrities who just did it for publicity but this year with twerking fitness classes and competitions you're seeing more people who are comfortable with it.' 

Winner Jemini, who has been twerking since she was 15 said: 'I didn't think I was going to win at all. 

'I'm really excited about performing with Nicki Minaj, just over the moon. 

'Words can't explain it, it's amazing.'  

'I started out doing hip hop and R&B when I was about 12 and then got into twerking when I was 15 in the dance hall scene because it's a big part of that. 

'I didn't really practise too much I just thought about what songs I wanted to dance to and went with it that way.' 

Jemima came second in last year's championship. 

Mizz Versatile and Jelly Melly won joint second place at this year's competition and shared £200 in prize money. 

Nicki Minaj's record label increased the first place prize from £300 to £1,000 after last year's competition. 

The singer is known for her twerking skills. Her new song, Anaconda, is very much based around the dance.
