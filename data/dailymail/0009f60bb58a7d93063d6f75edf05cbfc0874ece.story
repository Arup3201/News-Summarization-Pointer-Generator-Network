All week criticism has been raining down on them. From being likened to the Dog and Duck, to being told they are rudderless, to warnings about the manager’s job.

Tumbling out of the Champions League at such an early stage causes a maelstrom at Anfield and plenty — from Gary Neville to a raft of former Liverpool players — have had something to say about how poorly Brendan Rodgers and his side have performed this season.

So when the topic of criticism is raised with Jordan Henderson, there is a wry smile. Liverpool’s vice-captain has not shut himself away from the disparaging comments but he didn’t need to hear them. That is why he does not shirk the issue as this particular conversation unfolds at Melwood.

‘You’ve got to take (the Dog and Duck comment) as a bit tongue in cheek,’ said Henderson, gearing up for Sunday’s trip to Old Trafford. ‘(Neville) has said it as a joke. He doesn’t think either team is playing really well at the minute but that doesn’t bother us.

‘We know we are not playing well. We know we need to be doing better and I’m sure Manchester United feel the same.’

Henderson has developed a strong relationship with Rodgers. The England midfielder refers to his manager as being ‘one of the best in the world’ and has made no secret of how big an influence he had in reviving a Liverpool career that, at one stage, never looked like coming into bloom.

It is significant, then, to hear Henderson’s appraisal of Rodgers’ mood and methods following Tuesday’s disappointment against Basle.

‘He’s still confident in the way he wants to play football and is doing everything he can for us to start getting results,’ he said. ‘The outside world might accept that (it’s all down to the manager) but as players we certainly don’t accept it. We’ve got full confidence in the manager.’

Aware that victory at Old Trafford would dramatically alter the mood around Anfield, Henderson is quick to think back to how it was in March when Liverpool made the short trip down the M62 and terrorised David Moyes’ team.

The score that day was 3-0 but it could have been doubled such was Liverpool’s superiority; nine months on, Henderson does not accept United are now the better team, nor does he entertain the idea that Sunday will see Louis van Gaal’s side exact revenge.

‘We’ve got enough quality and character in this group to win on Sunday and the next game as well and then build from that,’ said Henderson, who has put contract talks to the back of his mind until Liverpool’s results improve.

‘Although United have been picking up some good results of late and showing some great resilience, I don’t think they’ve played fantastically well. Are they a better team than us? No. I see the quality and character that we’ve got at this club every day in training.

‘But it’s all well and good me sitting here and saying that but it’s up to us to go and do the business.

‘I’m not saying Man U aren’t a good team because they are and they’ve got fantastic players but so have we. So we’ve got to go there and do it. Hopefully we will.’
