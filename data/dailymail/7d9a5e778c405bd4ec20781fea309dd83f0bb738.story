A Spanish firm is courting controversy with its professional course in prostitution which it says 'guarantees a job offer on graduation'.

For just €100, students will be taught the history of the world's oldest profession, how to use erotic toys and the most popular positions contained within the Kama Sutra.

What they learn in the series of theory and practical classes will enable them to 'earn a lot of money, very easily and quickly', according to the ABC newspaper.

The venture has attracted much criticism in the predominantly Catholic country, with many saying it is the wrong way to tempt cash-strapped Spaniads back into work.

But the Valencian firm, which has flooded the city's university campus with promotional flyers, says it will make the trade safer.

It will also ensure budding sex-workers will not fall foul of the law, with in depth descriptions of the industry's laws and how to work around them.

Brandon, who has run the one-week course for eight years, said: 'They will know what they are getting in to.

'Prostitution is a career that many people live off from day to day, whether they are single or have a partner.'

He added that 95 people, from the age of 19 to 45, had signed up to the diploma - which takes up two hours each day.

And, once they graduate, they receive their first job offer - to become a teacher in the 'school' where they can help in practical classes.
