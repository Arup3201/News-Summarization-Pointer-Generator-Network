The first Test at Lord’s provided plenty of material for both sides of the Great Divide. If you think the new era is a land of milk and honey, you’ll have gone home cuddling your positives. And if you regard the ECB and Alastair Cook as devils incarnate, you’ll be smugly shaking your head.

The truth is somewhere in the middle. For while there were moments when Cook’s captaincy reverted to the type we winced at in Australia, the fact remains that England almost took seven wickets after tea on one of the flattest surfaces in the world game.

Oh, and it turned into an amazing game of cricket – a nine-down special which England, as if attempting to keep Test cricket alive all by themselves, seem to produce about once a year.

Of course, some perceptions refuse to be altered by the facts. England’s first innings rattled along at 4.4 runs an over, their fastest run-rate in a Test innings of 40 overs or more since India’s bowlers kept laying out buffets in 2011. Yet still some called it boring.

Then there was England’s second innings, condemned in some quarters as the period of the game which cost them the chance of victory. Arriving at the ground that day, Kevin Pietersen tweeted his wish: a lead of 380 by stumps. He got 389.

Despite this, others argued that England should have declared earlier, and that Cook’s desire to allow Gary Ballance to complete a maiden Test hundred obscured the team goal.

It is an argument that ignores a couple of important points. The first is that England spent much of the fourth afternoon trying to prevent their collapse of 6 for 75 from turning into something terminal. Shaminda Eranga’s probing spell earned Sri Lanka the right to scupper an early declaration.

It wasn’t until the final few overs of the day that Ballance felt comfortably about hitting out. If Cook had given himself half an hour to bowl at Sri Lanka on the fourth evening, the target would have closer to 330 – not inconceivable on a surface that remained flat and with Kumar Sangakkara batting like Superman.

The chances are that Sri Lanka would have been only three down at tea on the final day in any case. And it was a minor miracle that England came so close to forcing a win.

But, yes, there were issues too. Cook’s field placings on the fourth morning, when England needed three quick wickets to cement their huge first-innings advantage, smacked of a team that had not yet got the Ashes whitewash out of their systems.

Cook began with four men on the fence for Angelo Mathews, and later increased that to five. As Nasser Hussain pointed out, boundary fielders are not necessarily a problem – so long as attacking fielders are in place too. Yet Mathews twice nibbled Anderson between keeper and a floating slip for four. The field was not so much in-out as shake-it-all-about.

The last hour also included a couple of curious calls. Why give an over to Joe Root, which for a minute or two took the sting out of the situation? And why bring on Liam Plunkett for the ante-penultimate over when this was precisely the kind of scenario beloved of Stuart Broad?

We shouldn’t be shocked by these quibbles (though the over-rate from both sides was appalling): Cook will never wake up to discover he is Mike Brearley. And at least he showed willing while setting an 8-1 off-side field on Monday afternoon – even if he later admitted the idea was Jimmy Anderson’s.

Besides which, there was plenty at Lord’s to enthuse about. Ballance conveyed a rare kind of calm for a 24-year-old in only his second Test, and Moeen Ali batted with assured elegance in the first innings. Joe Root’s double-hundred, meanwhile, has glossed over his winter travails.

Yes, the attack lacks a proper spinner - England must hope Monty Panesar gets his act together for the arrival of India - but Chris Jordan took five wickets in his first Test, and Plunkett’s impression of a battering ram ought to receive its due on a more conducive pitch.

England began the Test ready to be written off as a rabble, and came within an inside edge of pulling off one of their most memorable wins for years. It’s not a bad start.

That's better: Alastair Cook tried to think up some more imaginative fields as the hosts searched for wickets

THAT WAS THE WEEK THAT WAS

Everyone knew what he meant, but that didn’t stop Moeen Ali’s assessment of Sam Robson, his fellow Test debutant, making an early bid for Freudian slip of the year. ‘I don’t think of Sam as an Australian,’ said Moeen of the Sydney-born opening batsman ahead of the Lord’s Test against Sri Lanka. ‘I just think of him as a normal person.’ It’s the kind of accommodating approach England’s new era is crying out for.

He's a... person! Moeen Ali (right) claimed he doesn't see Australian debutant Sam Robson as an Australian

Alex Hales should be careful. Not only is he in danger of getting picked for the one-day series against India later this summer on account of being one of the cleanest hitters in the land, but he has also been shredding his reputation as a white-ball specialist.

Sent to Coventry (and, briefly, Worcestershire) after averaging under 14 in the 2013 County Championship, Hales has been causing a stir back in Nottinghamshire’s first-class colours, smashing 167 off 133 balls against Sussex, then 96 off 110 against Middlesex. Much more of this and the selectors may be left with no choice but to accept he is indeed capable of batting in innings that last more than 20 overs.

Blasting: Alex Hales has been in sensational form for Nottinghamshire in all formats of the county game

A fortnight at the World Twenty20 not so long ago provided a reminder that no cricket nation lives in hope so eternally as Bangladesh. The expectations are so very real – and the inevitable disappointment is so utterly crushing. Many would give up.

But captain Mushfiqur Rahim is made of sterner stuff, subjecting his troops to classes from a ‘life success coach’ and calling for more eloquent ‘body language’. And what have his team learned? ‘We have learned that in ODIs, you have to play good cricket for 100 overs. You can't win by just playing well for two hours.’ There should be no stopping them now.

Cricketers, heal thyselves

Do the players know the laws? Sri Lanka’s captain Angelo Mathews felt Rangana Herath didn’t realise he was not out after the ball cannoned off a glove unattached to the bat handle and was caught down the leg side by Matt Prior in the final over of last night’s thriller at Lord’s.

This is amazing on two counts. One, it’s hardly one of cricket’s more obscure laws. Two, it suggests he doesn’t own the DVD of the 2005 Ashes, in which Michael Kasprowicz is given out by Billy Bowden at the end of the Edgbaston nail-biter in the same circumstances.

A couple of winters ago, Jonny Bairstow trudged off in a Test in Mumbai after he was caught by Gautam Gambhir at silly point. But the ball had nestled in Gambhir’s grasp only after ricocheting off the helmet – not out, in other words. Yet neither men knew the law. Is it time Test cricketers were given a crash course?
