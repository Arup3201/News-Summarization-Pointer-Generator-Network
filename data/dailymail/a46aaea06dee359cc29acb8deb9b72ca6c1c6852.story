A group of teenage skaters were the unsuspecting witnesses and first on the scene to Friday's commuter train crash that hurt more than 70 people in Connecticut.

The boys were enjoying their evening in Bridgeport, trying out new stunts, jumps and skating over ramps when they heard the tremendous sound of the two Metro North commuter trains slamming into one another.

The friends happened to be recording as the collision occurred. It is clear from the video they were not prepared to deal with the things they saw.

Scroll down for video...

Skater boys: The guys were in a nearby skatepark when the drama unfolded

Crash: Dust and debris can be seen in the distance as the boys see the collision happen right before them

Decisions: The boys hesitate if they should proceed further down the tracks as they see the carnage that lays before them

Upon climbing up the embankment to the railroad tracks, the four boys saw a scene of complete chaos in the aftermath of the collision.

They were on the scene for a good ten minutes before the emergency services arrived and saw passenger scrambling to get out of the derailed train cars.

Debris including glass from broken windows, twisted rails and other bits of sharp metal lay all about them.

Through the lens of the skaters camera, commuters could be seen helping one another off the train cars that were no longer sitting on the tracks.

Heroism: The video captures acts of bravery as shaken passengers help one another from the stricken train

Snapped: Broken rails and twisted metal can be seen all around

The boys can be heard asking shaken passengers if they're okay, but none of them decide to call 911.

Another of the teenagers suggests climbing aboard the train although it is not clear what his intentions might have been.

His friend, sensibly, tells him to keep off the train and away from the tracks that might still be electrified.

Viewers may be surprised to note that despite the shock clearly intimated by the boys, no real panic or screaming can be heard from people aboard or climbing off the doomed train.

Drama: Passengers evacuate the train that is now several feet off the tracks

Disruption: The line between New York and Boston is expected to be subject to delays for several weeks

Eerie: The boys arrive on scene moments after the crash occurred but before the emergency services arrive

One passenger speaks to the lads telling her that the train ride was 'worse than being on a rollercoaster', while another gentleman says the thought he was 'going to die'.

The skaters decided to leave once the police showed up but there is no doubt the video captures the eerie scene just moments after the train crashed.

'We were at a skateshop called Rampage across from where the incident happened, and well what we saw is what you'll see,' they commented on their YouTube film.on the YouTube description.

Officials investigating the cause of the crash ruled out foul play, and sent a damaged section of railway track for analysis.

Confusion: Shocked passengers try and understand what has happened by the side of the tracks

Overwhelmed: The boys are caught up in the drama of everything they're seeing and are clearly in shock too

Evidence: The first footage of the crash could provide some useful clues to NTSB investigators who are attempting to work out what went wrong

It is not clear if the accident was caused by the broken piece of track, or if it was damaged before the crash, said Earl Weener, of the National Transportation Safety Board.

He added that the investigation was in its early stages, and refused to speculate on why the train derailed near Bridgeport, at 6.10pm.

The National Transportation Safety Board began its investigation on Saturday, which is expected to last for seven to 10 days.

The board will examine the trains' brakes and condition, signal information and the performance of the crew.

Data recorders from the trains are expected to provide details on the speed of the trains and other information.

The railway tracks were damaged in the crash, and trains are suspended between New York and New Haven, Connecticut and with limited service Boston and New Haven.
