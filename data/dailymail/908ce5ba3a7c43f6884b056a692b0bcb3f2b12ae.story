Users of Google Plus, the search giant's much-hyped social network, visit the service for a mere three minutes a month, according to figures from Comscore.

The same figures show that Facebook users log in for an average of six to seven hours per month.

The figures add to the growing evidence that Google's social network is a dud, despite official figures from Google showing 90 million subscribers.

New figures from Comscore claim that PC users of Google's Plus social network spend a mere three minutes per month on the site, in contrast to seven hours for Facebook users

Google's Plus social network has 90 million registered users, according to the search giant's official figures

Britney Spears has two million followers on Google Plus - but others report that the site is less useful for reaching out to the public

Google claims that 60 per cent of Plus users engage with the site daily.

But critics claim that Google's figures are misleading, as Plus works within other Google services such as YouTube and Search, as well as various apps on Android phones.

The new Comscore statistics, reported by the Wall Street Journal, paint a very different picture - although they apply only to PC users, rather than mobile users.

'Nobody wants another social network right now,' Brian Solis, an analyst at social-media advisory firm Altimeter Group told the Wall Street journal. 'Google hasn't communicated what the value of Google+ is.'

Some public figures have found the network useful - Britney Spears, for instance, has two million followers on Google Plus.

But chip maker Intel said that its Google Plus page has a mere 360,000 followers, while nine million people follow Intel on Facebook.

The search giant was widely criticised for the 'Search Plus Your World' feature which added 'personalised' Google Plus results into Google searches.

Google is under investigation by the Federal Trade Commission for using its dominance in search to promote other, less successful services.

Google new 'Search plus your world' feature has come under fire from Twitter's general counsel for prioritising results from Google's Plus social network

The Next Web says, 'For all its features, Google+ may simply have come into the picture too late. While it has a buzzing and active photography community engaging with one another, if comScore’s figures are to be believed – there might not be much beyond that.'

But the blog said it was too early to judge Google Plus's eventual fate - many of the services that make Facebook successful, such as apps and games, have yet to launch or take off on Google Plus.
