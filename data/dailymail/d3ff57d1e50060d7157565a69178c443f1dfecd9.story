British troops are still involved in intense fighting in southern Afghanistan against a resurgent Taliban, just four months before the Armed Forces completely withdraw from the region.

Officially, ‘offensive operations have ended’ for British troops but an officer has revealed that they are still locked in firefights with the Taliban.

He called it a ‘snake pit’ of insurgents targeting strategic towns in Helmand, the scene of ferocious fighting since 2006 and where dozens of British soldiers have been killed.

'Offensive operations' have officially ended for British troops but they are still involved in intense fighting with the Taliban in southern Afghanistan, four months before the Armed Forces are due to leave

Paratroopers from 1st Battalion The Parachute Regiment have been deployed in support of the Afghan National Army but have found themselves fighting in what one Helmand veteran has called a ‘secret rear guard battle unknown to the British public’.

The Taliban are said to be just ‘days away’ from recapturing three Helmand towns. 

Senior British officers have spoken of their fears of the Taliban pouring back in but say there is little they can do as the withdrawal date approaches. 

Tory MP John Baron said yesterday he was ‘not surprised’ British troops are still in firefights and warned the area will eventually be effectively ‘handed back’ to the Taliban.
