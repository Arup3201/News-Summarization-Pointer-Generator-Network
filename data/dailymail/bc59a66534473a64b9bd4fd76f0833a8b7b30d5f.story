A wheelchair-bound Canadian got in touch with this wild side this weekend when he bungee jumped from a bridge in Whistler, British Columbia.

Riley Martin, 21, posted pictures of his harrowing experience on the social media site Reddit with the title 'I did something that truly scared me this weekend.'

Under the username, itakethecake, Mr Martin - who was paralyzed in a car crash - answered questions about his experience.

Mr Martin’s eye-catching posting received a whopping 816
comments today in only 5 hours.

Neonimous asked, ‘Curious, why did you have to be in the
chair? Couldn't you have done it without the chair?’

Mr Martin answered, ‘They said it was
easier to do it that way... I think it would have been less comfortable for me
as well to have my legs flailing everywhere instead of strapped to my chair so
they wouldn't move haha.’ 

Even though Martin is bound to his wheelchair that doesn’t
stop him from playing sports like basketball, tennis, and rugby, just to name a
few.

According to a publication written by Okanagan College where
Riley was a student, he won the wheelchair half marathon division, finishing
the 21.1 km course in 3:00:14.

Riley also drives a '66 Mustang and has quite a few secret admirers.
‘He’s crazy amounts of handsome!,’ said Reddit user CariniGambarini. ‘That man is a sexybeast,’ said user bendvis.
