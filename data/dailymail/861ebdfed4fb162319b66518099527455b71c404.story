How much would you spend on a pair of jeans? The received wisdom is that, as you get older, you should pay more for your denims to get clever cuts that disguise saggy or wobbly bits. But is this really true? Femail challenged me to blind test a selection of jeans costing from £5 to £500, and guess the prices. The results astonished me — and may change the way you shop.

£90, levi.com

Nothing special, no wow factor.  The high waist failed to add any oomph and they looked too traditional and  felt a little outdated and basic. The petrol blue colour was a bit flat. I’d have liked more zing.

My guess: £5. I thought these were definitely the cheapest!

For £90 I’d want something far classier.

£495, J Brand, selfridges.com

Black jeans are almost as essential as a good bra. But these emphasised my thigh bulges, which I could do without . . .

My guess: £90.

Oops! I’ve boobed this time. They felt good quality, but don’t justify that price tag.

£45, oasis-stores.com

The colour is  pretty and original, while the fit is a bit  loose, but soft  and easy. I’d say they’re for slobbing around in at weekends rather than sharpening up  with a natty  little jacket.

My guess: £35.

Phew! Not so  far out this time!

£245, trilogystores.com

These did it for me; I loved them. They made me feel years younger and were easy to wear, I couldn’t ask for more.

My guess: £500.

Well, they’re halfway there! And worth it — I’ll start saving up. 

£5, everything5pounds.com

I liked these. They had just the right amount of stretch, giving me room to breathe.

My guess: £100.

Wow! I’d never have guessed! I can see now the finish isn’t perfect, but they’re incredible value.

£12.99,  newlook.com

Not
 a kind cut. These jeans widened my hips, which need minimising on a 
good day. Sassy heels improved the look, but still no good for pear 
shapes.

My guess: £15.

Close — it’s obvious that these are from the lower end of the spectrum.

We all believe that the more you pay for your jeans the better quality you get - but is it true?
