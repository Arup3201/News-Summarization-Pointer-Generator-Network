Budget: Sally Shephard, pictured, bought a week's worth of fresh food for just £5.60, or 80p-a-day

A 29-year-old woman proved you don't need to break the bank to eat healthily - buying a week's worth of fresh food for just £5.60.

Sally Shephard carefully planned her 80p-a-day menu and raided markets and supermarkets for the best deals on fresh ingredients. 

And she even had change spare for a pork pie at the end of the week.

Miss Shephard, from Newcastle, said her aim was to live on the same budget as those who live below the international poverty line and raise money for impoverished communities in Kenya.

Her three meals-a-day diet consisted of core ingredients such as carrots, onions and rice that were bought at the beginning of the week.

And rather than indulging in costly alcohol or fizzy drinks, Miss Shephard washed her meals down with glasses of hot water.

She said the meals, which included omelettes, potato cakes and soups, weren't that different to what she would usually eat, and said it proved it was always possible to eat healthily - even on a shoestring budget. 

Miss Shephard, who is due to become a special needs worker next month, said:  'I bulk bought bags of potatoes and rice and bought fresh fruit and vegetables from my local market.

'I was never hungry and I had loads of money left even after I'd bought myself the ingredients.

'My diet during those seven days wasn't that different to what I would have normally and I had good, big healthy meals.' 

On day four of the challenge, Miss Shephard used the £2.24 she had in change from her main buy at the beginning of the week to pick up spinach, a cabbage and six eggs from the market. 

And on day seven, Miss Shephard even had enough money to buy a pork pie that had been reduced to 45p. 

She finished the week with five potatoes, five onions, more than half a kilo of rice, a slice of bread, two thirds of the cabbage and some butter - and  still had 9p in her purse.

Treat: At the end of the week Miss Shephard even had enough money to buy a pork pie that had been reduced to 45p, pictured, and still had 9p in her purse leftover

Miss Shephard said the challenge showed it is possible to live comfortably on low-cost ingredients, adding that there was 'no excuse' to eat unhealthy food as it is 'often so expensive in comparison'.

While she admitted the menu did become slightly repetitive, she said the meals were also surprisingly tasty. 

5kg potatoes: £1

10kg onions: £1

Bag of carrots: 49p

Wholemeal bread: 49p

1kg rice: 40p

Five bruised bananas: 5p

Butter: £1

Spinach: 50p

Cabbage: 50p

Eggs: 70p

Pork Pie: 45p 

She said: 'The potato cakes are a winner. I will be making them much more in the future.

'It has been a little repetitive but easily manageable and enjoyable. I have also surprised myself with how many tasty meals can be made with so few ingredients.

'I didn't have any fatty foods or anything processed at all. If anything my diet is much healthier as I have not been able to afford crisps, chocolate and alcohol.' 

The challenge, which lasted a week, has already helped Miss Shephard raise more than £1,000 for Mattumaini, a charity she set up. 

The project is dedicated to the development of the community in the slums of Nakuru, the fourth largest town in Kenya.

Miss Shephard said: 'All you read about in the news is the Government giving money to people who are obese to help them lose weight.

'I don't think that's right and I've got a friend who lives below the poverty line so I thought I would try and prove you don't need a lot of money to live healthily. I found it surprisingly easy.' 

Chopped: Miss Shephard said the challenge showed it is possible to live comfortably on low-cost ingredients, adding that there was 'no excuse' to eat unhealthy food as it is 'often so expensive in comparison'

Weekend boost: This hearty meal of two slices of wholemeal toast, two poached eggs and two potato cakes was just one of the clever meal that Miss Shephard came up with

Back to basics: Lunch on day four was just a plain jacket potato. Miss Shephard admitted that the menu did become slightly repetitive, but said the meals were also surprisingly tasty
