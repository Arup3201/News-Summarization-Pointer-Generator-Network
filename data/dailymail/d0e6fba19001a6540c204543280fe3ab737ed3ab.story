The body of former major league pitcher Frank Castillo has been recovered from a lake after he drowned while going for a swim.

Maricopa County sheriff's officials say divers pulled the 44-year-old out of Bartlett Lake yesterday afternoon.

Family members and friends say the father-of-two wasn't a good swimmer, but he jumped off a pontoon boat Sunday afternoon for a swim and didn't resurface.

Divers searched for several hours before suspending the search until Monday.

Castillo's family released a
statement to KVIA, saying: 'Frank Castillo died on Sunday in a drowning 
accident while with his family at a lake near his home.

'Frank was a wonderful son, terrific brother, and an extraordinary father to his two beautiful girls.

'Everyone who knew Frank loved Frank. We are devastated by this loss.'

Castillo had an 82-104 record in 13 major league seasons.

He pitched for the Chicago Cubs, Colorado, Detroit, Toronto, Boston and Florida from 1991 to 2005 before retiring and lived in the Phoenix suburb of Scottsdale.

Ruly Medrano, a former high school teammate of Castillo, told KVIA: 'He spent over a decade in the big leagues but you wouldn't know it if you met him.

'He was just a real humble guy, very friendly to everybody, very mild mannered.'

The Red Sox held a moment of silence for Castillo before last night's game against Tampa Bay.
