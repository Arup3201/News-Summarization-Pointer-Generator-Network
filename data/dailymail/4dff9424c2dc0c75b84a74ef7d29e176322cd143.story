Bashir offered an alternative version of the Lord's Prayer

Down the street from the George R.Brown Convention Center in Houston Texas, National Rifle Association members fumed at reports that MSNBC host Martin Bashir mocked their plans to attend a Sunday morning prayer breakfast after the group's annual convention wraps up.

On his cable network show Thursday, British import mocked gun-owning churchgoers and the Second Amendment organizers who have successfully blended a gun-rights social platform with evangelical Christianity.

'There is also a prayer breakfast at this weekend's conference,' Bashir said, 'presumably to include the NRA's version of the Lord’s Prayer: "Thy kingdom come, help me keep my military-style gun"; "Give us this day our daily dead"; and other various phrases like that.'

Bashir, who identifies himself as a committed Christian and once worked for the BBC on its popular Songs of Praise hymn-sing show - Great Britain's most popular religious television program - lamented that other Christians don't see a threat in the gun-rights movement.

'This is not a freak organization,' he explained. 'You describe Ted Nugent in the way you do, and some of these speakers, and yet they are paid to attend.'

'There are large numbers who will be hearing this [prayer breakfast]. Yet they spew this kind of venom about an issue that is as saddening and shockingly disturbing for us all, after what happened in Newtown and all the other massacres that we reflect on.'

Dr. Bob Reccord, a family-values political leader who once oversaw more than 5,000 evangelical missionaries for the Southern Baptist Convention, will be the prayer breakfast's keynote speaker on Sunday morning

Wayne LaPierre (R) is the NRA's long-time executive vice president. Together with president David Keene (L), a former top dog at the influential American Conservative Union, he has marshaled gun owners into a powerful political force that stands against Congressional Democrats and President Obama on gun control issues

At the Lobby Bar in the Hilton Americas-Houston hotel, NRA members flipped their lids when MailOnline played a brief video of Bashir's comments shortly after the Twitter-tracking website Twitchy distributed it Thursday night.

'I wish someone would slap some sense into that idiot,' said a Dallas native named Bob who said he was attending the NRA convention for the first time.

'Nothing gets me more worked up than self-righteous religious people who think they have all the answers,' he said, 'I go to church every Sunday, and I'll be at the prayer breakfast.'

Then, with sudden, beer-infused bravado, Bob stood and intoned, 'He can have my prayer breakfast ticket when he pries it from my cold, dead hands!' 

Conservative broadcaster Glenn Beck, a former Fox News personality who now has his own online pay-per-view shows, will headline a 'Stand and Fight Rally' at the NRA convention Saturday night

Convention-goer Janet Bero waited in line to have her German Luger pistol appraised by hosts of the NRA's Antiques Guns and Gold Showcase, an Antiques Roadshow-like television program focuses largely on firearms

Tickets for the event cost $35 each. The 'cold, dead hands' line is a hat-tip to the late actor Charlton Heston, who uttered the memorable quip at the NRA convention in 2000 when he was the organization's president.

Referring to then-presidential candidate Al Gore as a gun-control advocate, Heston closed his keynote speech that year by saying, 'As we set out this year to defeat the divisive forces that would take freedom away, I want to say those fighting words for everyone within the sound of my voice to hear and to heed - and especially for you, Mr. Gore - "From my cold, dead hands!"'

Charlotte, a middle-aged mother of two who flew to Houston from Nebraska, told MailOnline that Bashir 'is the kind of Brit we should deport before [President Barack] Obama pushes his immigration legislation through.'

'It'll be too late by then, won't it?' she chuckled.

And Jim from Oklahoma City predicted that the MSNBC host's 'rants will fall on deaf ears anyway. I bet no one here for the convention has ever watched MSNBC. Have you? I sure haven't.'

'He's preaching to the choir,' he said, before adding, 'D'ya think his church has a choir?' 

All three NRA members asked MailOnline not to publish their last names.

Dr. Rick Rigsby (R) is a former Texas A&M University professor who also served as character coach and chaplain for the college's football team, the Aggies

The biggest buzz at the 2013 convention surrounds gun control legislation that Second Amendment activists say threatens their freedoms under the U.S. Constitution. This attendee's gun-decorated shirt reads 'I don't dial 911'

The NRA convention kicked off Thursday night with a sold-out fundraising dinner and auction to benefit the NRA Foundation, a charitable organization allied with the NRA that provides grants to support education programs about shooting sports.

Saturday night's headliner, conservative broadcaster Glenn Beck is a Mormon who has been outspoken in his support for gun rights.

The prayer breakfast will include remarks from Dr. Bob Reccord, a former president of the Southern Baptist Convention's offshoot that oversees the work of more than 5,000 Christian missionaries.

He now leads the Council for National Policy, a conservative group founded by preacher Tim LaHaye, who authored the controversial yet popular Left Behind series of novels whose subject was a post-Rapture world after the second coming of Jesus Christ.

Liberal activists have described the Council as a right-wing version of the Council on Foreign Relations, an influence-building amalgamation of prominent family-values conservatives who serve as kingmakers in U.S. politics and build support for far-right policy.

The far-left blog Daily Kos once dubbed the group 'Sith Lords of the Ultra-Right.'

Other speakers at the prayer breakfast will include Buck Knives CEO Chuck Buck and Dr. Rick Rigsby, whose claim to fame is a 14-year stint at Texas A&M University as a 'character coach' and chaplain for the school's football team.
