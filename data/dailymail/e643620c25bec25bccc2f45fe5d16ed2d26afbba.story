Recycling your waste has been taken to a new level by one London designer who has made a whole collection from waste food.

Hoyan Ip reuses leftovers, dubbed 'bio-trimmings' everything from handbags to belt buckles.

The collection is made by drying the food and coating it with a clear substance.

A handbag made from waste foods. Its designer has worked on a whole range of products from buttons to belt buckles.

Hoyan tried dozens of different foods, and found those high in carbohydrates worked best.

Food was dried, the crushed.

It was then recombined with a binder, and placed into moulds of the required shape, where is was dried for a second time.

The designer is now developing a waterproof coating for the material.

'They are made out of wasted food, anything from leftover dinners to junk food,' 26 year old Ip told MailOnline.

'There was a lot of experimentation of foods to find out what worst best - but I'm keeping the exact recipes to myself.'

The food was selected and dried.

It was then crushed, and moulded into the required shape as it dried.

'There is no smell, but at the moment the products aren't machine washable,' said Ip.

She is currently developing a coating to protect them from the wet.

'I'm hoping to develop backing to sell them, but the main thing is to promote starvation and other global issues.

'Sustainability is a key theme for the fashion.'

Buttons created by the designer can be used in existing designs such as jeans

'I propose to identify the relationship between food waste and waste 
produced from the fashion industry,' she wrote on her web site.

'It can be argued that nothing is new anymore in terms of fashion 
clothing as similar trends are re-interpreted season by season and it is
worthwhile to preserve what we already have in our wardrobe ready for 
it to be a current trend again.'

'As there are more and more designers emerging, there is very little we 
can do to dispose of the unwanted clothes ethically especially when you 
realize such sensitivity and though has gone into making a garment.

'The solution is to re-use the clothes, de-brand them, repair them and wear them.‚Äù

Ip tested dozens of different foods, but has kept the exact recipe secret.

The designer has also created clothing, including shirts, trousers and even a bow tie using the 'bio-trimmings' material.
