Father Robert Cormier, of Jersey City, died after falling about 1,000ft from the top of Oregon's tallest peak, it has been reported

A Catholic priest from New Jersey died after falling about 1,000ft from the top of Oregon's tallest peak.

Father Robert Cormier, 57, of Jersey City, ascended Mount Hood's south side with two others but continued alone when one of his companions suffered a leg cramp, Hood River County sheriff's spokesman Pete Hughes said.

Father Cormier appeared to reach the summit before he fell near Eliot Glacier at the volcanic peak 50 miles east of Portland.

A helicopter photographed the climber and his position but saw 'no signs of life,' Hughes said. The office later confirmed his death.

Father Cormier, a published author of books on religion and faith, was ordained as a Catholic priest in 1982.

Jim Goodness, spokesman for the Archdiocese of Newark, told MailOnline: 'He was a very dedicated priest, very passionate and compassionate.

'Most of his life as a priest, we are talking about 32 years really, he was ordained in 1982, he was involved in urban ministry settings, so he was very familiar working with people who are city residents - different ethnic groups, those on a lower economic level and immigrant populations. He was fluent in five languages.'

Father Cormier's biography on his publisher's website also describes him as a pilot, mountain climber, sailor, cave explorer and scuba diver.

Hughes says rescuers will wait until next
 week to recover Cormier, when colder temperatures would afford them 
more stability on the rocks and ice.

Spring is the prime season for climbing Mount Hood because the weather is better but not so warm that the ice melts and rocks fall more readily. The peak is notorious for loose rocks in warm weather.

Conditions were warm in the area on Monday and Tuesday, with a reported temperature of 47F (8C) Tuesday morning on the summit.

'Climbers up there reported the snow was getting warm, and they wanted to get down and get off,' Hughes said.

Thousands of people climb the 11,240-foot peak each year.

The most recent death at Mount Hood was in August. A Polish military officer visiting the United States for training with a drone manufacturer went to the summit on a day off.

The most fatalities in one accident were seven students from Oregon Episcopal School and two adults who died after they dug a snow cave during a sudden storm in May 1986.
