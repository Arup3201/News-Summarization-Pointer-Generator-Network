Warning: Scottish secretary Alistair Carmichael has warned that Scotland will be forced to quit the sterling if it votes for independence next year

Scotland will be forced to quit the sterling if it votes for independence next year, the Scottish secretary has warned.

Alistair Carmichael said the country could not guarantee a currency union with the UK after becoming independent.

It is the most prevalent warning yet for Scottish voters to remain in the UK in the referendum on September 18 next year.

Speaking about the possibility of keeping sterling, Mr Carmichael told The Financial Times: 'George Osborne has said ... it is highly
unlikely.

'Most people in Whitehall understand that if George Osborne 
says something is highly unlikely, it is not going to happen.'

And when asked if he believed an independent Scotland would be excluded from the currency, he simply replied: 'Yes'.

Mr Carminchael's comments come as the Scottish National Party prepares to unveil its blue-print for its the vision of an independent Scotland.

If the country achieves independence, party leaders are expected to insist that it should be able to keep the sterling as an 'asset' that is partly owned by Scotland.

This would allow the country to continue sharing the benefits of the Bank of England. 

Earlier this year, George Osborne warned that Scotland could end up 'like Panama' if it gains independence, but keeps the pound.

The Chancellor said it was ‘unlikely’ the rest of the UK would want to enter a currency union with a separate Scotland.

However, he has refused to rule it out - claiming he would not 'prenegotiate' the terms of the country's exit from the union.

The First Minister of Wales has also declared that he would try to veto any attempt to create a currency union with Scotland following independence - claiming it was a 'messy' solution that could have a detrimental effect on Wales.
