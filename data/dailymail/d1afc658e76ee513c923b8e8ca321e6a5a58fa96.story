The atmosphere was as expected and so was this Scotland team. The Battle of Britain was a game too far for Gordon Strachan’s men.

Credit to Scotland’s supporters because the intensity, the wall of noise predicted by Roy Hodgson was mighty impressive before England took control. Scotland are a mediocre team.

Celtic Park is a magnificent sporting cathedral and the mood was passionate and partisan, which is just the way we like it.

When Scotland’s supporters stood on their feet for the unofficial terrace anthem - I'm Gonna Be (500 miles) by the Proclaimers - it was spine-tingling.

Every fan inside this grand old stadium was on their feet, belting it out as they waited for the teams to emerge from the tunnel.

When they did, this fabulous place stirred again when the bagpipe players began to hum Flower of Scotland.

Their tails were up and rightly so after Shaun Maloney’s magnificent goal against the Republic of Ireland last Friday had sent 50,000 kilts home happy.

You just knew what a goal against England would do to this place, but no amount of singing can turn Scotland into a decent football team.

How Wembley, the dreary concrete bowl constructed in west London seven years ago, could do with a good dose of this before England play their next match there in March.

They are regenerating the surrounding areas, so why not sort out the stadium acoustics a go, too?

Something must be done because the supporters of both these teams reminded us what a football stadium should sound like on a big match night. At times, the place crackled with excitement.

There was a boo for everything: England flag transported across the pitch. Boo. Fraser Forster’s name read out. Boo. Nathaniel Clyne. Boo. Luke Shaw. Boo. And so it went on.

It was old school, blood and thunder and a reminder of the days when these two slugged it out for pride and honour at the end of every season on a churned up pitch at Wembley or Hampden Park.

Quite what this means for England - other than a sixth successive victory following the World Cup disaster - is a different matter.

There were moments of forced patriotism, such as the sight of England’s assistant manager Ray Lewington stalking the technical area and appealing for calm. It was rough, rather than refined.

Perhaps Lewington remembers Graeme Souness and Bryan Robson ripping each other’s heads off when Scotland beat England 1-0 at Hampden Park way back in 1985.

There was the odd skirmish here, but the modern player has a different constitution. There is a bit of back chat and then they agree to swap shirts at the end of the game. All very convivial.

At times there some pedantic squabbles, but no-one left the pitch with stud marks raked down their thigh or a bloodied nose after this largely one-sided clash. No-one’s socks were cut to ribbons, either.

There was a bit of afters when Danny Welbeck got sick and tired of Scotland right-back Steven Whittaker nibbling away at his ankles in a feisty opening spell.

Wayne Rooney, sensational throughout, showed his colours when he bawled out his team-mate Jack Wilshere for a careless pass long before England took control.

To say England controlled the tempo or ever looked entirely comfortable would be stretching the imagination, but they certainly played in bursts.

Scotland boasted just two players - goalscorer Andrew Robertson (Hull) and Steven Naismith (Everton) - from the Barclays Premier League. The rest are Championship players and they looked like it, too.

This is a unique fixture, a game that has fallen off the international radar in recent times because of the sheer number of qualifying games and reciprocal arrangements with opposition teams over friendly fixtures.

It means Scotland, who were courageous and honest, will probably have to wait a while again England can find a date for them in their congested fixture list.

Strachan’s side were beaten 3-2 at Wembley last August but this defeat, courtesy of goals from Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and two from Wayne Rooney - felt terminal.

There is a huge gulf and that is saying something because this England team is not operating at anything like the level of world champions Germany.

By the time Swedish referee Jonas Eriksson blew the final whistle, the stands at Celtic Park had emptied. This was England’s night.

They rushed over to the travelling England fans at the final whistle, saluting them after emerging with their reputations enhanced after this victory.

All they can do is to beat the opposition put in front of them and they are certainly doing that after travelling north of the border to beat Strachan’s side.

The only disappointment is that they couldn’t take this unrivalled atmosphere back with them.
