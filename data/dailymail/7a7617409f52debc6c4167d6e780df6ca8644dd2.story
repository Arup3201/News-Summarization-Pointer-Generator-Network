Texas A&M quarterback Johnny Manziel became the first freshman to win the Heisman Trophy, taking college football's top individual prize last night - and capping a record-breaking debut season.

Nicknamed 'Johnny Football,' Manziel kissed the trophy during a ceremony at the Best Buy Theater in New York's Times Square.

'I have been dreaming about this since I was a kid, running around the backyard pretending I was Doug Flutie, throwing Hail Marys to my dad,' he said after hugging his parents and kid sister.

Flutie was one of many Heisman winners standing behind Manziel as he gave his speech.

'It's such an honor to represent 
Texas A&M, and my teammates here tonight. I wish they could be on 
the stage with me,' he said with a wide smile, concluding his speech 
like any good Aggie: 'Gig' em.'

Just a few days after turning 20, 
Manziel proved times have truly changed in college football, and that 
experience can be really overrated.

His Twitter followers have jumped from just under 100,000 a few days ago to more than 140,000 today - and counting.

Manziel tweeted last night: â€˜Such a special night I cannot even put it into words. Such a blessing and an absolute dream come true! Aggieland I love you all!!'

Manziel's the second player from 
Texas A&M to win the Heisman, joining John David Crow from 1957, and
did so without the slightest hint of preseason hype.

What's more impressive is that he didn't even win the starting quarterback job until two weeks before the season.

'I always wanted to be in a fraternity,' Manziel said. 'Now I get to be in the most prestigious one in the entire world.'

At 6-foot-1 and 200 pounds, Manziel is 
master of the unexpected, darting here and there, turning plays 
seemingly doomed to failure into touchdowns.

With daring runs and elusive 
improvisation, Manziel broke 2010 Heisman winner Cam Newton's 
Southeastern Conference record with 4,600 total yards, led the Aggies to
a 10-2 in their first season in the SEC and orchestrated an upset at 
then-No. 1 Alabama in November that stamped him as legit.

He has thrown for 3,419 yards and 24 
touchdowns and run for 1,181 yards and 19 more scores to become the 
first freshman, first SEC player and fifth player overall to throw for 
3,000 yards and run for 1,000 in a season.

'You can put his numbers up against anybody who has ever played the game,' Texas A&M coach Kevin Sumlin said.

Manziel has one more game this season, when the No. 10 Aggies play Oklahoma in the Cotton Bowl on January 4.

Prestige: The Heisman Trophy is displayed before it was awarded to Johnny Manziel

As for the Heisman, Manziel said he'd like to keep it right next to his bed.

'But I'm in college. A lot of people 
come through the house. We live in a college neighborhood. It might not 
be a good idea. If I can get a case that's indestructible, locked and 
looks pretty good, we'll see where I keep it,' he said.

Manziel competed with two other 
quarterbacks to replace Ryan Tannehill - who went on to join the Miami 
Dolphins - as the starter this season, the Aggies' first in the SEC and 
first under Sumlin.

Manziel came out of spring practice as the backup, but became the starter in August.

Still, nobody was hailing him is the next big thing. Did Sumlin think he had a Heisman winner on his hands?

'No,' he said emphatically, adding, 'Not this year.'

Then Manziel started playing and the numbers started piling up.

He also had some struggles against 
Florida in the season opener and in a home loss to LSU. The question 
was: Could he do his thing against a top-notch opponent?

The answer came in Tuscaloosa, 
Alabama, on November 10. Going into the matchup against the Crimson 
Tide, Manziel said he and his teammates heard a lot of doubters.

'You can't do this and you can't do that,' he recalled Saturday at the podium.

Manziel passed for 253 yards, ran for
92 and the Aggies beat the Tide 29-24.

Kansas State quarterback Collin Klein, who was also in the Heisman running, had been the front-runner 
for most of the season, but Manziel surged after beating 'Bama.

Still, Manziel was still something of
a mystery man. Sumlin's rules prohibit freshmen from being available to
the media. Manziel was off-limits, but not exactly silent.

Manziel gave glimpses of himself on 
social media - including some memorable pictures of him dressed up as 
Scooby-Doo for Halloween with some scantily clad young women.

Romantically, he's linked to fellow A&M student Sarah Savage, who posted photos of herself by Manziel's side with the Heisman on the photo-sharing site Instagram.

Miss Savage has a background in modeling, and is represented by the Julie Freeman Agency, according to SlimCelebrity.com.

Before he became a celebrity, Manziel got himself into some serious trouble.

In June, he was arrested in College Station after police said he was involved in a fight and produced a fake ID.

He was charged with disorderly conduct and two other misdemeanors.

After the season, Texas A&M took 
the reins off Manziel and made him available for interviews, allowing 
him to tell his own tale.

Notre Dame linebacker Manti Te'o finished a distant second in the voting and Klein was third.

In a Heisman race with two nontraditional candidates, Manziel broke through the class ceiling and kept Te'o from becoming the first purely defensive player to win the award.

'That barrier's broken now,' Manziel said. 'It's starting to become more of a trend that freshmen are coming in early and that they are ready to play. And they are really just taking the world by storm.'

Manziel drew 474 first-place votes and 2,029 points from the panel of media members and former winners. Te'o had 321 first-place votes and 1,706 points and Klein received 60 firsts and 894 points.
