Just hearing the word ‘web’ probably sends shivers down the spines of arachnophobia sufferers.

But if they grin and bear the irony, it may be possible for them to overcome their phobia by logging onto it.

That’s because there’s now an app available from iTunes called Phobia Free that’s designed to help people overcome arachnophobia - a fear of spiders.

Creepy crawly confidence: The app claims that it can help you overcome your fear of spiders

It’s even been reviewed and approved by NHS England.

Phobia Free, available on iPad and iPhone, helps to tackle people’s fear by exposing sufferers to more and more realistic spiders over time.

The app uses a novel interactive method to achieve this through relaxation techniques and in-app gameplay while setting goals and tracking progress.

Users of the app confront their fear by progressing from cute spiders all the way up to an augmented reality tarantula that looks and behaves like the real thing.

‘Having our app approved by the NHS is a tremendous endorsement of our work,’ said Dr Andres Fonseca, co-founder of Virtually Free, which made the programme.

'We believe this initiative by NHS England to give people access to quality assured apps and protect patients is very important. Smartphones and tablets have become integral tools in people accessing medical information and the large amount of information out there, can sometimes become overwhelming for people to access the help they need.'

Arachnophobia is the acute fear of spiders and affects six per cent of the population.

In extreme cases arachnophobia suffers may experience panic attacks as a result of their fear.

It is one of the most common phobias to affect people in the UK and the world.
