Daley Blind's only previous visit to Anfield came as a wide-eyed 10-year-old when his footballing father Danny secured tickets for a game against Arsenal from Jari Litmanen, a former team-mate who had signed for Liverpool.

Among the players on view were Steven Gerrard, Michael Owen and Thierry Henry. 'It left a great impression on me,' said Blind. 'As a young boy from Holland who loved football, I just took everything in. The crowd noise and atmosphere were crazy. It was a special day.'

At lunchtime on Sunday, Blind will return to Anfield for the first time with his new Manchester United team-mates. This year's clash carries even greater significance than usual with a Champions League place at stake and for Blind it carries on the family tradition of being involved in big matches.

His father played 42 times for Holland and was captain of Ajax's legendary 1995 Champions League-winning side alongside Patrick Kluivert, Edgar Davids and Edwin van der Sar. It was a first major triumph for an emerging manager called Louis van Gaal who clearly likes the Blind family. Almost two decades later, he selected Daley for Holland's World Cup team last summer and then signed him for Manchester United in a £14million deal from Ajax.

It has been an eventful debut in the Premier League for both of them. Manchester United's results have been far better than last season when they finished seventh under David Moyes. They visit Anfield having lost just twice in 19 league games.

At the same time, their performances until last weekend's 3-0 victory against Spurs had been patchy with new signings like Angel di Maria and Radamel Falcao struggling.

Blind has been a steadying influence, his versatility useful as Van Gaal has tried to juggle injuries and suspensions. The 25-year-old has been used mostly as a holding midfielder but with Michael Carrick returning last weekend, he switched to left back as United turned in their best performance of the season.

Blind says his manager is essentially the same person in England as when he took Holland to the World Cup semi-final.

'People only think he's intimidating because he is honest. He is honest to people,' explained Blind. 'Yeah, sometimes the truth can be hard to some players or people. But I really like that in a person and especially in a manager.

'Every player knows their job, what they have to do in training and matches. It is very clear and I think that makes everything a bit easier for players. As a team we believe in his philosophy.

'It is a good feeling for a player if you know where you stand. Sometimes it can be a bit frightening when somebody is really honest but I think it is positive. I don't get any special treatment, definitely not. I make mistakes, too, and I try to learn when he says something. It can look as if he is angry but he is trying to make you better. He does that from a football perspective, it's not personal. He treats everybody the same.'

In keeping with United's season, Blind has experienced highs and lows. A knee injury that kept him out for six weeks in the autumn was frustrating. When fit, he has weighed in with important goals at West Brom and West Ham and last week was vital in the Spurs win, with Luke Shaw and Marcos Rojo unavailable.

It was seen as a return to the old, swashbuckling United. Blind doesn't think it's that simple. He believes United didn't change their approach much, the major difference was getting two early goals.

'Everything came together. We tried to play attacking football. But there were still moments we used David de Gea to switch play or had to show patience. But of course when you are leading 3-0 at half time it is a lot easier because the fans are excited. I think we have played better and better in recent weeks, against Spurs maybe we did it for longer.'

The cries of 'attack, attack' heard from United fans this season are meant to lift the players. But Blind says the team have to use their heads in matches, too.

'Of course, you go on the pitch feeling you want to win. Every game is difficult in the Premier League, you have to be also smart in the games.

'Sometimes you need to have composure. Against Tottenham, we attacked them in the first half. Then in the second half, we let them come at us a bit more and played from there. I think we can play different styles.'

That adaptability is one of the reasons Van Gaal signed Blind rather than any other member of his Dutch World Cup squad. He has proved invaluable in a season where United have suffered an unprecedented number of injuries and said: 'I think I am a player who can switch really fast in my mind. For me, it is not an issue where to play. I know what you have to do in each position. I think it is an advantage for me.'

Van Gaal described Daley's father as the best leader he's ever had — some claim when he has managed at Bayern Munich and Barcelona.

Daley says he has inherited characteristics from both parents. 'I think on the pitch I am more like my dad. Calm and thinking about stuff. Off the pitch with my friends, I am more like my mum. She says things straight away, very direct. I can speak sometimes without thinking.

'I was five when my dad won the Champions League. I can't remember watching it live on the television but, growing up, I saw all the videos and dreamed it might be me one day. I am proud of his achievements and proud to carry the name Blind.

'I guess I must have seen Louis van Gaal as a boy when I'd go to watch my father train but I can't remember anything specific. I first got to know him with the Dutch team.

'When Louis van Gaal tells me things, I think it might be the same advice he used to give my father!'

Daley and Danny also work together with their national team where Danny is a coach and tipped to be manager.

'Sometimes I prefer to speak to the other trainers,' laughs the younger Blind. 'If he's close by, I might whisper "Dad". The other players think it's funny, they accept it.'

Danny is also a regular visitor to watch his son play at Old Trafford but won't be at Anfield on Sunday afternoon.

Off the field, Daley has settled in well and chosen to live in a city-centre apartment rather than a sprawling footballers' wives pad in Cheshire. 'I like people around me and everything within walking distance,' he says. 'Occasionally people want to take a picture on the street but that's not a problem. I liked Amsterdam and I like Manchester, they suit me.'

It also gives Blind peace of mind that his girlfriend is in a safe environment when he is away with the United squad.

For someone who knew only two of United's players when he arrived — national team-mate Robin van Persie and youngster Andreas Pereira, who started his career in Holland — Blind has acclimatised well. One of his social objectives is to try to find time to restart golf lessons.

He has been in England nearly eight months now. 'The best thing for me is the amount of away fans that follow United. The stands are always full, it was a big surprise when I first saw that,' he said.

'On the pitch, the pace and power of matches was new for me, box-to-box. My first game at home to QPR wasn't the quickest but I still felt more tired than after any Ajax match. When we played at Manchester City and had a red card (Chris Smalling), wow, the intensity but I think I coped well.'

If a problem does arise, his manager is an important safety net. 'He is personal, any player can always reach him if they want to,' he says.

And the result when Blind visited Anfield just over 14 years ago? Liverpool lost 2-1. A repeat on Sunday would leave United with one foot firmly in the Champions League. Like father, like son.
