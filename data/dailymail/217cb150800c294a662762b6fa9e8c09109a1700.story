Dead: Julia Niswender, pictured, was found dead in her bedroom on December 11

The death of a 23-year-old Eastern Michigan University student has been ruled a homicide but police still have no suspects six weeks after her body was found in her off-campus apartment.

Julia Niswender was found dead in her locked bedroom on December 11 after her roommate told police they hadn't seen her for days and she failed to show up to a Christmas party.

Toxicology results from the Washtenaw County Medical Examiner offered no conclusive information as to what caused her death, according to the Ypsilanti police said today.

But officers confirmed it was a homicide and said they'd continue to hunt for Niswender's killer.

'The police department recognizes and understands the publicâ€™s interest in this death investigation, and Ypsilanti police detectives, the Michigan State Police, and federal agencies continue to utilize all available tools and investigate all possible sources of information regarding this case,' police said in a statement to Detroit Free Press.

The 23-year-old twin was discovered lifeless in her bedroom along with evidence they dubbed 'suspicious.' They have not elaborated on what kind of evidence they found or how she was killed.

Police went to Niswender's apartment at around 9:30 p.m. after her roommate called and asked them to check on her welfare as she hadn't been seen for a number of days.

The communications major worked at Walmart part time and had failed to show up at the supermarket's staff Christmas celebrations that night, concerning colleagues.

Officers arrived and called paramedics but she was pronounced dead at the scene.

Suspicious: Police said they found suspicious evidence surrounding Niswender's body

Ypsilanti police Detective Sgt. 
Thomas Eberts said immediately that police were treating Niswender's 
death as suspicious, adding that the evidence found in her apartment led
to 'unanswered questions.'

After the grisly discovery, the university sent out an alert to warn students of an incident near campus, Fox News reported.

While she didn't live at the university, she shared a flat at the Peninsular Place Apartments, which are very near to the EMU campus.

EMU police held a campus safety meeting the day after her body was discovered, taking questions from distraught students and offering safety tips to around 200 members of the community who showed up.

Police asked students to take extra safety precautions, suggesting they avoid wearing
headphones while walking on campus, walk with a partner, call police
if they see something suspicious and to call authorities if they get 
any unsolicited visitors.

EMU officials also said they were adding extra police patrols.

Niswender was described as a loving, outgoing and kind friend. She was a budding broadcaster who recently toured the NBC studios in New York City, where she met Anderson Cooper.

Next to the picture she had taken with him, she wrote: 'Yup got a pic with Anderson Cooper :) gotta love NYC and yes i have a cheesy smile lo. (sic)'

The young woman's twin sister, Jennifer, wrote a heartbreaking tribute to Julia on her Facebook page after her death, as condolences from friends and family members flooded her wall.

'No
one will ever understand what I am going through right now, but I just 
want to say thank you to everyone who has been calling, texting, 
emailing and posting and for all your support during this horrible 
time,' she wrote.

'Also, 
thank you to everyone who stopped by to visit with my family and I. I 
wish i could respond to each and everyone of you but words can't 
describe how I feel. Julia was my twin, other half, and best friend.

'No
one will ever understand the bond we shared. I love her so much and 
just don't know how I can go on. My beautiful sister didn't deserve 
this. Justice will be served even if it is the last thing I do! The rest
of my life I will be living for her.'

Speaking at the campus meeting, 
University President Susan Martin choked up as she extended her 
sympathies to Niswender's friends and family.

'Our job is to communicate directly 
to you what we know and what we don't know,' she told students, many of 
whom were in tears in the auditorium.

One of Niswender's Walmart colleagues told Fox News the young woman was 'always smiling.'

'Best personality, loudest laugh, just wouldn't hurt anybody, always smiling,' Keith Logue said.
