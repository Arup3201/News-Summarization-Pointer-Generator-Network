Hollywood star: Actor Errol Flynn became famous for his role as Robin Hood in the 1938 adaption of the tale

His swashbuckling characters were often leaping to avoid the thrust and parry of a sword.

But it appears Hollywood film star Errol Flynn was equally adept at evading his creditors.

A family clothing company in Northampton has discovered letters which show he ran up debts of thousands of pounds that were never paid.

The actor, who died in 1957, launched his career in Northampton in the 1930s when he performed with the town’s Repertory Company based at the Royal Theatre.

Flynn went on to reach global fame in 1938 when he starred in The Adventures of Robin Hood and became an American citizen in 1942.

But letters found in a dusty box in the 
storeroom of Montague Jeffery menswear shop reveal how he was even 
pursued by private detectives for his unpaid debts in Northampton.

Jonathan Williams, whose grandfather Bernard Jeffery served Errol, said: 'It was when we found out the new cinema was going to be named after Errol Flynn that we decided to look through our old papers and discovered this old unpaid bill.

'Unfortunately the bill does not specify the amount he owed but considering the shop hired private detectives to pursue him for the money it must have been the equivalent of several thousand pounds in today’s money.

'My grandfather Bernard knew Errol and would supply him with pyjamas and pants and socks which were never paid for.

'Everyone knows about Errol’s legendary manhood but my grandfather never mentioned anything about it, I don’t know if he had to alter any of his clothing.

Discovery: Jonathan Williams, managing director of Montague Jeffrey Menswear, Northampton, found letters which show how the actor owed the shop thousands of pounds

Pleading: The letters signed by Errol Flynn show him asking for an extra week to pay his debts

'Before my grandfather died he told me how Errol would run up large debts all over the place and would promise to pay but never did.

'He used to drink in what is now The Mail Coach and was a regular at the shop, my great-grandfather knew him quite well.

'We do have a letter from him promising to pay his debt, but we don’t know exactly how much he owed.

'It would be interesting to know how much the letter would be worth now, because he obviously never paid his debt off.

'Errol Flynn came back to Northampton when his Hollywood career and was immensely popular despite his habit for running up huge debts.'

Jonathan’s great-grandfather Montague Jeffery opened the shop in 1901.

Still waiting: The correspondence shows that Flynn owed so much money the shop sent private detectives to track him down

A hand-written letter Flynn sent to the shop’s private detectives suggests he was struggling for cash despite his fame.

Flynn wrote: 'If you would care to wait about a week longer I will be able to pay your account in full.

'The only reason it has not been settled previously is inability, not disinclination. Yours, Errol Flynn.'

A further letter from the detectives says that Flynn was 'successfully evading' them as gaining entry to the film studio where he was working was 'out of the question'.

The letters from Flynn to Montague Jeffery date from 1955, 20 years after the star had moved to Hollywood.

Before he died aged 50 in 1957, Flynn was known as a womaniser and had a reputation for running up large debts.

He joined the Northampton Repertory Players in January 1934 and remained with the company for 18 months.

Flynn, who is regarded as one of the biggest Hollywood stars of all time, now has a cinema named after him in the town, the newly opened Errol Flynn Filmhouse.
