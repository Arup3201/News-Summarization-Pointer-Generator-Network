Barefoot, ties askew and ball dresses stained and tattered, the students of Trinity College clattered through the streets of Cambridge after a night celebrating the end of exams at the traditional May Ball.

But most weren't going home, even though dawn had most definitely broken. Still clad in rather worse-for-wear dinner jackets, top hats and 
glamorous floor-length dresses, hordes of students prepared to carry on 
the celebrations with drunken punt rides on the River Cam or breakfast 
in college gardens following the £300-a-ticket event.

Judging by today's pictures, the students were sticking faithfully to this year's mantra, which, according to the official website, was 'Eat, Drink, Rave, Repeat.'

Man down! Cambridge University students toasted the end of exams at the famous Trinity May Ball but it all got too much for some with one reveller choosing to take a small power nap in the street

It's getting hot out here! Clearly the warm June weather was just too much for some of Britain's brightest young minds, who decided to remove their clothes in the streets

These rather dishevelled ravers are, in fact, some of Britain’s most elite
 students and judging by the alumni - who include Charles Darwin, Prince
 Charles, David Attenborough and CS Lewis - they are the leaders and 
thinkers of tomorrow.

Academic high-fliers they might be, but the event did prove a little too 
much for some of them, who were seen face down in the gutters of Cambridge or 
stuffing their faces with sweets on the pavements. 

A few, however, were still immaculately dressed and seemed
 relatively sober after enjoying a night of lavish entertainment.

The black tie ball is the biggest event of the Cambridge student social calendar and marks the end of exams.

Guests were treated to a sumptuous five-course meal served in Trinity Great Hall, followed by music and dancing. After an evening partying with British pop rock band Lawson, some then continued overnight with drunken punt rides on the River Cam and a champagne breakfast in the college gardens.

The night is young: This young couple seem to have no plans to head home as they continue to puff on cigars into the early hours

The sold-out ball is the largest event of the Cambridge student social calendar and some students queued for three hours to get into the event yesterday evening.

Guests were treated to a lavish five-course meal served in Trinity Great Hall, which included pea soup, crab cocktail and beef fillet.

Students
tucked in to oysters, hand-made crepes, a hog roast and a cascading
chocolate fountain, while drinks were served from a floating punt on 
the river.

This year's sold-out bash featured 
dance performances and comedy until the early hours, all finished off 
with the traditional survivor’s photo and firework display.

Entertainment was provided by comedian Russell Kane, R&B band Big Brovaz and band Lawson and students could also opt for luxury spa treatments, a gamble at the casino or relaxing in the jazz tent. 

Got the munchies? Some of the students set up camp and enjoyed a small picnic following the event, which sees a crowd of 2,000 bleary-eyed revellers stumble through the city's historic streets after partying the night away at the Trinity College bash

Dancing queen: Two young lovers enjoyed a waltz on a bin following the £300-a-ticket event and prepared to carry on the celebrations with drunken punt rides on the River Cam or breakfast in college gardens

Having a ball: Britain's brightest young minds passed out in punts and wandered the streets during drunken scenes of havoc and debauchery on their way home from an infamous Cambridge May Ball this morning

Sociable: A gaggle of girls were sure to keep their social media fans up-to-date with the evening's proceeding

Glory days: Undergraduates traditionally celebrate the end of the academic year by dancing the night away at a series of balls held at the different colleges at The University of Cambridge

Quick swig: One reveller, who dressed in female attire, enjoyed a light tipple as he joined hundreds of classmates who wandered the streets

It featured a fireworks display which lit up Trinity College for more than an hour.

The ball has been held every year 
apart from 1910 when King Edward VII died and between 1939 and 1945 
during the Second World War.

The first one was held in 1838 when 38 
Trinitarians happily drank their way through 47 bottles of champagne, 12
of sherry, six of Mosel, two of Claret, six quarts of ale and 16 huge 
servings of punch at a post-race dinner at the Hoop Inn.

Neighbouring Jesus College and Clare Colleges held their summer balls on the same evening.

And Queens College's May Ball will be held tonight - complete with a new bridge over the River Cam for the lavish do.

Trinity May Ball 
is held on the first Monday of May Week, which, despite the month in the
 title, always takes place in June after exams.
