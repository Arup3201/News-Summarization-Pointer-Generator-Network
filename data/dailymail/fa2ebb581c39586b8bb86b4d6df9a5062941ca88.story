A 22-year-old man has been charged with capital murder in the deaths of three women whose bodies were found in their Fort Worth, Texas home.

Cedric D. McGinnis Jr. is being held on a $1.25 million bond.

Authorities say McGinnis is the ex-boyfriend of April Serrano, 21, who was of one of the victims who was found shot through the head and had her throat slit.

Confessed: Cedric D. McGinnis Jr., 22, confessed to the slayings and told detectives where evidence from the crime could be found

Killed: 21-year-old April Serrano was found dead on the floor in the living room with a gunshot wound to the head

Murdered: 35-year-old Kathy DeLeon, (left) and 48-year-old Cynthia Serrano (right), were discovered by Cynthia Serrano’s husband as he arrived home Tuesday morning

Family members had said the victims' 
throats had been slashed, but police said Wednesday that two of them 
died of gunshot wounds to the head, while the third suffered stab wounds
 to her torso.

April Serrano was found dead on the floor in the living room. Another
 victim was found dead on the living room couch, also shot in the head, 
and the third in a bed in the master bedroom..

Authorities say McGinnis admitted to the killings 
under questioning and told detectives where evidence from the scene 
could be found.

He had earlier in the day posted a message about his ex-girlfriend’s death on his Facebook page, sending love to her and her family and remarking that it was always the innocent ones 'that get f***ed over.'

The victims are 48-year-old Cynthia Serrano, her 21-year-old daughter April Serrano, and her 35-year-old sister Cathy de Leon.

shift.

When the husband, James Serrano, called 911 he yelled: 'They killed my family.'

Tarrant County court records show McGinnis has a 2011 conviction for possession of marijuana under two ounces and, last year, for evading arrest.

Shock: Grieving family and friends gather outside the Fort Worth home where three women were killed

Family and friends of the victims gathered outside the single-storey home in Fort Worth on Tuesday, as detectives and forensic experts gathered evidence.

Anthony de Leon, who was Mrs Serrano and Mrs de Leon's brother, was overcome with grief as he said: 'Three innocent women; three innocent women.'

He said that the women were alive and well when family members checked on them at about 10pm on Monday.

Angel Bueno sobbed softly as he stood across the street from the faded yellow, wood-frame house where the bodies of his cousin and his aunts, de Leon and Cynthia Serrano, had been found earlier.

He said his aunt Cynthia raised him and had sent him a loving text message the night before her death.

'She was the sweetest lady. She even took care of my own daughter for a while, and she was praying for Junior,' Bueno, 25, said, placing a hand over his pregnant wife's belly.

More than a dozen family members of the victims sat on the curb under police tape, consoling each other while waiting for an update.

Relatives said it was Serrano's husband, James Serrano, who called 911 when  he returned from an overnight trucking shift.

Rosa Guerrero, whose aunt, Cynthia, was one of the victims, said: 'No one was expecting for this to happen to them.'

She described her aunt as religious, and said she always attended Mass on a Sunday.

The cries of the victims' family alerted neighbors to the tragedy. Lorena Hamilton, who lives a couple of houses away, said she heard police sirens and then a woman screaming.

'As I walked out here, I saw this woman screaming and crying, down on her knees,' Ms Hamilton said. 'She told me, 'They killed her family'.'

Investigation: Police tape is used to block off the street around the home where the three victims were found

Mrs Serrano's husband, who alerted police to the murder, is being questioned by police, a family member told AP.

The medical examiner's officer was expected to release details about the cause of death in the coming days.
