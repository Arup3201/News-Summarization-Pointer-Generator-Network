A whole lottery trouble: Teenager Josh Sargeant pictured after winning £500,000 on the McDonald's Monopoly game which he used to buy a house in an upmarket cul-de-sac

When Josh Sargeant won £500,000 in a fast-food promotion, he sensibly invested much of the money in property.

His new neighbours, however, did not get such a good deal.

Within weeks of arriving in their quiet cul de sac, the 19-year-old had installed a garden hot tub, was holding late-night parties and was welcoming up to six visitors an hour.

His neighbours told a court yesterday of loud music, engines revving, doors slamming, bad language and suspected drug abuse.

One said the teenager had so many visitors day and night that she felt like she was ‘living in the car park at Tesco’.

The teenager was taken to court by his local council after he breached the terms of a good behaviour contract drawn up in response to the residents’ concerns.

The judge yesterday imposed a two-year antisocial behaviour order banning Sargeant from playing loud music and holding excessively noisy parties.

He could be jailed for up to five years if he breaches the order.

Sargeant had planned to start a gardening business with some of the cash that he won on a Monopoly game at McDonald’s in March 2011.

Instead he began to live off the rental income from a second property.

Neighbours in Sleaford, Lincolnshire, queued up to give evidence against him at the hearing.

Anne Hutchinson, 63, told Lincoln magistrates: ‘It’s a living nightmare for all the people who have struggled to buy a house in what was a nice cul de sac.

‘It is the noise and the traffic and the slamming of car doors.

'It is the swearing and the behaviour of everybody that goes to that house.

'Cars are going in and out of the property seven or eight times a night.

'I’m two doors away and I can hear it. It happens whenever he has friends round.’

Nicola Norman, who lives next door to Sargeant, approached the police and council after suffering ‘many’ sleepless nights.

‘At one point I had five nights in a row when I didn’t get any sleep,’ she said. ‘It got to the point where I had to go and stay with friends so that I could guarantee getting some sleep.’

A third neighbour, Sarah Brown, a financial adviser, said: ‘It’s extremely disturbing. It’s the noise disruption, the driving and the shouting.

'There have been incidents of fighting in the driveway.’

Splashed the cash: Sargeant bought his home for £185,000 in August 2011 and also owns a buy-to-let property for around £180,000. He has blown most of the remainder of the winnings

James Carter, for North Kesteven 
council, told the court that although Sargeant’s behaviour had improved 
in the weeks leading up to the hearing an Asbo was necessary to prevent 
further problems.

A council source told the Daily Mail that a neighbour filmed two men inside Sargeant’s kitchen apparently taking cocaine.

Police executed a search warrant at the house but found no evidence of the drug.

Sargeant left his parents’ home after
paying £185,000 in cash for the four-bedroom house on the new estate.

He is believed to have spent a similar amount on his buy-to-let property
but to have spent much of the rest of his winnings.

'It's a living nightmare': Neighbours of Sargeant's detached house (above) in Sleaford, Lincolnshire, complained of loud music, late-night parties, cars revving, bad language and drug taking

He claimed he had put a stop to the 
parties, stopped socialising with unsavoury ‘hangers-on’ and had evicted
an unruly tenant.

He said he had also sold off the hot tub, which was a
source of much of the noise.

The council’s Heidi Ryder said the 
court’s verdict was ‘proof’ that anti-social behaviour was ‘not 
acceptable and will not be tolerated.’

Outside court, Mrs Hutchinson said she was relieved the Asbo had been granted.

‘It was one of the nicest streets in town but people were being made ill by what was going on,’ she said.

‘You never knew when it was going to start or when it would finish. I hope now that Josh listens and behaves himself.’

Windfall from grace: Sargeant (pictured, left, leaving court today) was just 17 when he won a fortune on the fast food giant's Monopoly Game in April 2011 (right)

Sargeant was ordered to pay £2,000 court costs.

He was just 17 when he won the £500,000 Monopoly prize at the Sleaford branch of McDonald’s.

Owing to his age the prize had to be claimed by his father, Garry, who was with him in court yesterday.
