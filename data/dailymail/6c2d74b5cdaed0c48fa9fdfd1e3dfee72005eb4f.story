Senator John McCain is fighting words with words as he has written an editorial blasting Vladimir Putin in a Russian newspaper.

The Republican politician's op-ed comes a week after Putin took to The New York Times in an effort to speak directly to the American people about the dangers of a military strike on Syria.

Now McCain has written a scathing attack about how Putin's presidency is 'destroying' Russia's reputation and slams the leader for making decisions based not in the best interest of his people.

Fighting words: John McCain has written an editorial blasting Russian President Vladimir Putin in one of his country's top newspapers

Damaging: McCain says that Putin (seen here with Syrian President Bashar al Assad in 2006) has damaged Russia's global reputation by making them 'a friend to tyrants and an enemy to the oppressed'

'He has made (Russia) a friend to tyrants and an enemy to the oppressed, and untrusted by nations that seek to build a safer, more peaceful and prosperous world,' McCain wrote in the Thursday edition of Russian newspaper Pravda, making a clear reference to Syrian President Bashar al Assad.

News of the editorial was sent out via McCain's press team early Thursday morning.

They said that McCain brought up the issue of inalienable rights which Americans are afforded under the U.S. Constitution, saying that Putin is threatened by the notion.

'President Putin doesn’t believe in these values because he doesn’t believe in you,' McCain wrote.

'He doesn’t believe that human nature at liberty can rise above its weaknesses and build just, peaceful, prosperous societies. Or, at least, he doesn’t believe Russians can. So he rules by using those weaknesses, by corruption, repression and violence.'

Taking heat: Senator McCain was an early supporter of President Obama's call for missile strikes against Syria

Warmongering: Putin, seen meeting here on Wednesday with Mikhail Kalashnikov who created the AK-47 rifle, has been the most vocal supporter of Syria's President Bashar al Assad

McCain took pains to make it clear he was directing his criticism at Putin and not the country on the whole.

'When I criticize your government, it is not because I am anti-Russian. It is because I believe you deserve a government that believes in you and answers to you. And, I long for the day when you have it,' he wrote.

The editorial does not come as a surprise as Pravda offered McCain the opportunity to have a rebuttal in their paper following Putin's piece in the New York Times.

Though McCain and President Obama were rivals in the 2008 presidential race, the two have been together on their stande against Syria as McCain was one of ten members of the Senate Foreign Relations committee whocoted to allow the President to order a military strike against the country in response to their use of chemical weapons.
