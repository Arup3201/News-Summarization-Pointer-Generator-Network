The 'confessed killer' of the murdered Miss Honduras beauty queen smiled chillingly into the camera on his way to the cells last night, as his victims' grieving mother warned that the suspect's family will try to buy his freedom.

Teresa Muñoz told MailOnline she feared that Plutarco Antonio Ruiz, detained for the murders of Maria Jose and Sofia Alvarado, will never be brought to justice in a country where corruption is rampant.

The bodies of the two sisters were found buried in a river bank near the spa where they had disappeared a week earlier. Police believe Sofia's boyfriend Ruiz shot her in the head in a jealous rage, before shooting Maria Jose twice in the back. They say he has confessed to the deaths.

Mrs Munoz, who buried her two children near their hometown of Santa Barbara yesterday, warned that bribes for suspects are common as police sent four suspects to jail.

Suspected accomplice Aris Maldonado was arrested on Tuesday alongside 32-year-old Ruiz, while spa owner Ventura Diaz and his wife Elizabeth Alvarado were arrested the next day for allegedly burying the bodies.

Despite being under investigation, after his arrest Maldonado managed to post a message on Facebook  protesting his innocence.

It stated: 'Thanks to the people who are with me at this difficult and unjust moment in my life. Tabloid newspapers invent everything but I have faith in God and know everything will turn out okay.'

Clasping two family albums, Mrs Munoz sat with friends as she showed MailOnline childhood photos of the sisters and talked about her daughters.

She said that someone had told her one of her daughters would become a model, she would have guessed Sofia because her elder daughter was always more of an extrovert while Maria Jose was more timid.

But she believes that Maria Jose's status as a model and beauty queen is the only reason the deaths are being taken seriously.

'I believe that if my daughter had not been a representative of her country, her death wouldn't have brought any justice,' she said.

Jose Luis Mejia, director of the Technological University campus in Santa Barbara, where Maria studied, agreed that the deaths would not have become a national outrage if it had not been for the model's standing.

'If she had been any other girl, if she hadn't been Miss Honduras, this would have been one more crime amid the impunity of Honduras,' he said.

'They would have said what they always do: that this was the settling of accounts between drug traffickers, and they wouldn't even have bothered to investigate.'

San Pedro Sula, just over 30 miles from Santa Barbara where the girls were murdered, is the murder capital of the world with more than 1,200 killings a year among its nearly one million inhabitants.

The youngest of three sisters, Alvarado began competing in beauty pageants at age 13. She won Miss Northwest Honduras, Miss Teen Honduras and, finally, Miss Honduras, the stepping stone to the Miss World pageant.

After each competition, she would come back to Santa Barbara and share the details of her experiences with friends

'Her successes were our successes,' said schoolmate Ludin Reyes. 'We were friends and fans.'

While Alvarado pursued her dream, and her oldest sister married and moved away. She was a teacher until the school where she worked closed, and in love with a married man who left his wife to be with her, before he was murdered in October 2013.

Sofia's new boyfriend Ruiz was known about town as a man to be feared from a family deeply involved in drug trafficking, officials say. Although he had no police record, he was seen as someone who could offer protection or eliminate enemies.

'This is a drug trafficking corridor,' said Lt. Col Ramon Castillo, an army officer in charge of security in Santa Barbara. 

'David Ruiz, Plutarco's brother was 'the bull' and when he was killed in February, Plutarco took his place. ... Plutarco is a violent person with a bad character and he solves everything with a pistol in his hand.' 

Police say Ruiz shot Sofia because she was dancing with another man. After a fierce argument, he pulled out a pistol and fired at Sofia first, then Maria as she tried to flee.

General Ramon Sabillon, the National Police director, said  Ruiz had confessed to the killings on Tuesday and led authorities to the bodies in a mountainous area in Santa Barbara.

It is a mystery to Maria's friends why she went with her sister to the rundown 'spa,' or riverfront restaurant, that was believed to be a place that Ruiz used to conduct illegal business. 

But Alvarado looked up to her big sister and, after baking a cake together, apparently wanted to join Sofia to celebrate Ruiz's birthday on November 13. 

The day after the party, Ruiz told the sisters's family the women had left the with someone else, and he invited them for lunch. Later, he even went with them to file a missing persons report with police. 

Maria's body, wrapped in brown plastic, was loaded into the back of a pickup truck just hours before she was to have boarded a flight to London to compete in the Miss World pageant. A winner will be crowned on December 14.
