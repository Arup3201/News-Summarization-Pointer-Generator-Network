The New York Stock Exchange will reopen for regular trading Wednesday after being shut down for two days because of Hurricane Sandy.

The exchange said in a statement Tuesday that its building and trading floor are fully operational and that normal trading will resume at the usual starting time of 9:30 a.m.

There had been erroneous reports Monday that the exchange floor had flooded. Exchange spokesman Ray Pellecchia said the exchange's building did not have any flooding or damage.

New York Stock Exchange will re-open on Wednesday

Deluge: Officials decided late Sunday that it was too risky to ask any personnel to staff the exchanges

Tuesday marks the first time since 
1888 that the NYSE remained closed for two consecutive days because of 
weather. The earlier shutdown was caused by a massive snow storm.

Sections of Manhattan were inundated 
with water on Tuesday and power was shut off to millions of people and 
businesses up and down the East Coast.

Manhattan's financial district was 
one of the hardest hit when Hurricane Sandy slammed New York Monday 
afternoon and through the night.

Initial reports that the exchange was three feet underwater were denied by a press spokesman.

'There has been no damage to our 
building or systems, and we will conduct tests with the industry today 
with the aim of reopening U.S. markets on Wednesday,' NYSE spokesman Ray
 Pellecchia said in a statement.

Though they would not go into 
specifics, a number of generators must be located onsite in order for 
the prospect of a Wednesday reopening to be considered, since lower 
Manhattan remains without power and will likely continue as such for as 
long as week, according to city power executives.

The closure has made several records 
in the history of the exchange, as Monday's closing was the first time 
that the markets were formally shut since the days following the 
September 11 attacks in 2001.

Beyond that, it was the first time that it closed since Hurricane Gloria 27 years ago.

CNN earned itself another black eye after wrongly reporting that the New York Stock Exchange was flooded with three feet of water following the worst of Hurricane Sandy.

‘There has been no damage to our building or systems, and we will conduct tests with the industry today with the aim of reopening U.S. markets on Wednesday,’ NYSE spokesman Ray Pellecchia said in a statement.

During a live segment on Piers Morgan’s show Monday night, the anchor spoke with the network’s meteorologist who based the sensational claim solely on a comment left in a chat room.

‘You have an update on the stock exchange situation. Do we still think that three feet of water got into the exchange? There seem to be conflicting reports now,’ Morgan asked meteorologist Chad Myers.

‘Oh, is that right? You know, I got that from the National Weather Service chat bulletin board. It was right on there; it said three feet of water on the floor. I don’t know if there’s conflicting reports or not,’ Myers said.

The claim instantly went viral, spreading quickly on social networks and circulating as fact.

An NYSE official quickly tried to thwart the rumor, saying that the infrastructure of the landmark Wall Street building was ‘fine’.

A spokesman for the network issued a vague apology, purposefully avoiding the point of the fact that their sources were as murky as the alleged sea water that covered much of lower Manhattan.

‘Chad referenced a National Weather Service report that turned out to be incorrect. We quickly made an on air correction. We regret the error,’ CNN spokesman Bridget Leininger said.

When today's closure was announced it
 was became first time that the NYSE was closed for two consecutive days
 due to weather since 1888.

Like much of the city, the Exchange 
braced for the impact of Hurricane Sandy on Sunday, lining up a sandbag 
barrier outside the building on iconic Wall Street.

Nasdaq officials began employing 
their contingency plans as soon as they came to the decision to close on
 Sunday around 10.30pm.

Traders were able to continue to 
complete a drastically-reduced level of orders electronically, as many 
banks have remote systems set up so that employees can work from home in
 crisis situations.

The New York Stock Exchange, which is
 a privately-held company in itself, keeps a secondary location up and 
running in case of emergency where all data is stored.

The problem there, however, is that 
the data centre is in Mahwah, New Jersey, which is dealing with 
potentially more structural damage than New York.

According to Wall Street and Tech, 
the centre boasts a supply of 28 megawatts of power, which equates to 
the amount used to power 4,500 residential homes.

Additionally NYSE spokesman Robert 
Rendine told The New York Times that they have a number of generators 
and sufficient fuel to power the site for at least one week if 
electricity does not return.

'I'm a little surprised that the 
exchanges couldn't secure the technology needed to keep the market 
operating,' said Dominic Salvino, a trader from the Chicago Board 
Options Exchange told Bloomberg Businessweek.

'It seems unreasonable that the 
nation's financial markets have to shut down just because everyone has 
located themselves within five miles of each other in New Jersey. A snow
 storm in Chicago wouldn't shut down trading on the East Coast.'

The ripple effects are already being 
seen, as companies are postponing their quarterly earnings, which were 
scheduled to be released earlier this week.

According to CBS News, pharmaceutical giant Pfizer and media conglomerate Thomson Reuters are two of the tardy reportees.

Dozens of companies have postponed 
earnings reports this week because of the storm, but Ford Motor Co. did 
release results for the third quarter that topped Wall Street 
expectations.

Ford's revenue fell 3 percent to 
$32.1 billion because of the economic crisis in Europe and falling sales
 in South America. The company exceeded Wall Street's revenue forecast 
of $31.5 billion largely because of North America, where revenue jumped 8
 percent.

European stock markets rose broadly 
Tuesday after falling the day before. Trading was subdued in the wake of
 the storm. Britain's FTSE 100 index rose 0.9 percent, Germany's DAX 
rose 1.1 percent and the CAC-40 in France was 1.5 percent higher.

Crude oil rose 14 cents to settle at $85.68 in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange.

U.S. bond trading was closed Tuesday.

Electronic trading for U.S. stock index futures was open, but trading volume was very light and the price moves were minuscule.

As of the regular close of trading at
 9:15 a.m., Dow Jones industrial average futures rose 8 points to 
13,062. S&P 500 futures added 3.50 points to 1,411.10. Nasdaq 
futures slipped 3.75 points to 2,655.25.

On Monday, when regular U.S. stock trading was also closed, stock index futures fell slightly.
