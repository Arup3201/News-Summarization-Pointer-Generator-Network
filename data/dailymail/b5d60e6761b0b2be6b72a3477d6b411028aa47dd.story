Rio Ferdinand claims the Football Association unfairly made an example of him by banning him for three games for using a derogatory term about women in a tweet.

And he has increased pressure on the governing body by saying he will now be interested to see what action is taken against Wigan manager Malky Mackay.

Ferdinand used the term ‘sket’, Caribbean slang for a promiscuous woman, in an abusive exchange on Twitter and was banned by the FA for three games for using discriminatory language.

He returned to the QPR squad as an unused substitute for Saturday’s 3-2 win against Leicester.

‘I have got used to being made an example when it comes to the FA,’ said Ferdinand. ‘I just think the severity of the ban and everything else to do with it was crazy.’

And ex-England captain pointed to the FA’s indecision whether to charge Mackay for sending private racist and sexist text messages.

‘If I am the benchmark, then Mackay better beware of what is coming down the lane - if you are going off what I have been charged with,’ he said.

Ferdinand: 'They have many, many bigger issues going on that needed a lot more attention than my ban'
