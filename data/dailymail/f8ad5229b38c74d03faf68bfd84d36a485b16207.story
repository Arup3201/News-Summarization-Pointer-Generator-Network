When David Gower describes something as 'innovative' and 'inspirational'  you sit up and pay attention.

The England legend says 'cricket has changed for the better' over the last 20 years. And he'd know - he has witnessed first-hand how the sport has evolved. 

From Hawk-Eye to Snicko, HotSpot to the batsman's wagonwheel - the presentation of cricket has been changing constantly during the former England captain's time at Sky Sports.

At last: England captain Alastair Cook could celebrate his side's first win in 11 Test matches on Thursday

As England were marching headlong toward their first Test victory in 11 matches against India at the Ageas Bowl, an 80-strong team were buzzing around behind the scenes as Gower chatted on air.

Crowds may have been disappointing for large parts of the third Test in Hampshire – with just 4,784 spectators in attendance on the fourth day – but the viewers at home were still tuning into the action on Sky Sports in their droves.

Since Sky first broadcast cricket in 1990, when they covered England’s overseas tour of the West Indies, innovations to enhance the viewer's experience have come thick and fast.

Cricket fans do not just watch a bowler running in and a batsman slapping the ball through extra cover any more – they can listen to the on-field reaction thanks to stump microphones, see how a spinner has managed to get so many revolutions on the ball with hi-motion replays and find out if an opener has nicked the ball through Hot Spot analysis.

The Sky Sports punditry team includes six former England captains, several Wisden cricketers of the year and World Cup winners. Between them they have:

The commentary team includes:

Innovations: Michael Holding (left) and Ian Ward talk through issues on Sky Sports Zone during the third Test

Sky Sports cover a range of different cricket matches including international Tests, ODIs and Twenty20s, as well as county matches. For just one cricket match, here is what is needed:

The public face of the operation are the star-studded pundits who boast 769 Tests, 33,440 runs and 1,694 wickets between them – including Sportsmail columnists Nasser Hussain and David 'Bumble' Lloyd alongside Gower, Andrew Strauss, Shane Warne, Michael Holding and Sir Ian Botham – as well as the stats man Benedict Bermange.

The pundits and production staff are well 
fed - they get an extensive menu at every ground, with the Ageas Bowl 
providing options including prawn jalfrezi, with curry a favourite of 
Botham and the rest, as well as salmon or lasagne.

Each match alone needs more than 30 cameras, 40 microphones, 15 production trucks and 15 miles of cabling are placed around the ground and controlled by a crew of 80 staff.

But there is one view cricket fans rarely glimpse - the sheer manpower that goes into providing the pictures.

Gower – a veteran of 117 Tests, including 32 as England captain – said of the operation: ‘It is huge what goes on behind the scenes.

'Because of the innovations and the developments provided by the production staff we can be very forensic about pretty much anything. If you have someone like a Shane Warne up against you, if you think "how do I steal a bit of a clue about facing them?" You can view his action on screen in depth. That would have been – and now should be – an advantage.

Close-up: Sky use 30 cameras in order to provide as many angles and slow-motion replays as possible

Pricey: For cricket coverage Sky Sports use this state-of-the-art truck... the most expensive in Europe

Wires: Hundreds of cables are attached to Sky's new broadcast truck used during the third Test

View: The truck is home to 78 different TV screens which each show a different feed of the match

On show: The director chooses from the different feeds what will be shown next on Sky's coverage

'DRS (the Decision Review System) has helped to change the game on the field as well as for the viewers back home – we just have this strange situation where the Indians can opt out of it, but we can still use it in the studio and it has definitely moved the game forward.'

Holding, the former West Indian fast bowler who was nicknamed the 'Whispering Death', was equally as effusive of Sky's development of cricket.

In his famous Caribbean twang, Holding explained: 'Having all the information we get now cannot do the players any harm – if they don’t want to use it then ignore it.

'The most important thing for me as a former bowler is the Wagon Wheel which shows where a batsman scores his runs. That would have really helped me to decide where to bowl to them to starve them of runs and it is a great innovation.'

Decisions on which pictures from the 30 camera feeds and the various gadgets used will be broadcast to the viewer next are decided from inside an £8m truck – the most expensive on the road in Europe – using 78 screens.

In some ways the lavish expenditure on the production of cricket appears vulgar, but viewers want innovations, and in a world where budgets keep increasing and the likes of BT Sport are competing for every sport going, it makes sense to try and eek out every little bit to highlight how the coverage is different.

Sky Sports has broadcast cricket since 1990 – when they showed live coverage of England’s tour of the West Indies. It has developed its production over time and the director’s truck which is the most expensive truck on the roads in Europe. Here are some of the main innovations since cricket started on Sky:

1990 – Stump microphones

1991 – Stump cameras

1999 – Widescreen

2000 – Interactivity (red button options)

2003 – Helmet-cams and player mics

2004 – Umpire mics

2004 – Ultra-motion replays

2006 – Hi-motion replays

2006 – High definition

2007 – Hot Spot analysis

2008 – Field Plan

2009 – Pitchcam

2010 – 3D international cricket

2011 – 3D country cricket

2013 – SkyCart

Angles: Members of the 80-strong production staff trawl through footage to provide replays and analysis

Former captain Andrew Strauss is the newest member of the punditry team - having made the switch from the playing field to the commentary box.

He said: 'I played with some of the guys before I came here but walking in on the first morning and being like: "Hi guys, you are the people who have been criticising me for the last six years, nice to work with you", was a bit strange.

'Everyone feels a little bit sheepish but it is very much a team environment in the commentary box.

'Every cricket team now has an analyst so they will be putting together packages from all of the new technology - it really has taken the game forward unbelievably over the years.'

Long history: Sky have been covering live international cricket, both home and away, since 1990

Analysis: Number crunching is done behind the scenes to provide the commentators with facts and figures

As Strauss explains: ‘We (the pundits) just do the easy work by chatting away – it’s those guys behind the scenes who provide you with all your lovely pictures and graphics.’

Cricket coverage has been revolutionised in the last 24 years and innovations will continue and the viewer’s experience will improve further. Who knows what the next new gadget on show will be.

As Gower says: 'Cricket has really been dragged into the 21st Century by Sky – who knows where they will take it next.' 

And who knows, maybe one day the Indians may even accept that technology - and in particular DRS - is here to stay.
