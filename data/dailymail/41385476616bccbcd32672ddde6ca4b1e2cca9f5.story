Have you ever envisaged what your perfect stag do would look like? Most blokes would probably tell you that theirs would involve beer and football in some capacity - and to make it extra special they'd like to meet a one of their sporting idols.

Well, an events company has come up with the ultimate stag do package which allows you to have a kickabout with Teddy Sheringham or Matt Le Tissier, for instance, from as little as £60 per person.

Stag do website chillisauce.co.uk have joined up with Play With A Legend to allow grooms-to-be and their friends to play with or against one of their footballing heroes - and then spend time chatting with them over a leisurely pint!

More than 50 former football stars such as Sheringham, Le Tissier, Dietmar Hamann, Danny Murphy and Paul Merson are available to hire for the ultimate stag do experience.

The 'Play With A Legend' experience is the brainchild of 49-year-old ex-Arsenal winger Perry Groves - who is one of the footballers available for your stag do - and sports journalist Josh Landy.

A total of two-and-a-half hours can be spent with your chosen star (inclusive of the time for the match), ensuring you get at least an hour in the pub after your kickabout enjoying a couple of pints with Dion Dublin, Darren Anderton, Luther Blissett, David Howells or whichever football is present.

The prices are split into three tiers, depending on the former professional, but the cost of a stag do for 21 people (two teams of XI if you include the ex-footballer of your choice) starts at around £60 per person (or £1,260 overall).

Cost varies depending on which ex-footballer you choose, the amount of players per side and the venue chosen.

The likes of Sheringham and Merson cost approximately £3,250 to £3,500 overall (£155-167 per person) and other players will cost £1,500 (£72 a man) or £1,260 (£60 a man).

Games can range from five-a-side (nine people) to 11-a-side (maximum of 28 people) with the greater number of players bringing the price down.

In terms of venues, your bog-standard five-a-side pitch is perfectly acceptable - although matches have also been played at non-League venues and even at Norwich City's Carrow Road!

As well as the hire of a football pitch for between 30 and 90 minutes (depending on location and the preference of the stag party), you'll also get a referee to officiate the match, a designated event organiser and two sets of plain T-shirts for your teams included in the price.

It's better for you than just a day of drinking, at any rate.
