More than a year after ash dieback was discovered in the UK, not a single product is available to tackle it

Fears are growing that most of Britain’s 80million ash trees could be lost because of delays in licensing potential treatments for a deadly disease.

More than a year after ash dieback was discovered in the UK, not a single product is available to tackle it.

A firm which has developed a promising treatment claims the Government has snubbed it despite independent laboratory tests showing it is effective.

The airborne fungus – chalara fraxinea – is rife across mainland Europe, where in countries such as Denmark it has already affected 90 per cent of ash trees.

With the infection confirmed at 501 sites across the UK, the Government is focused on identifying trees naturally resistant to the disease, which could then be used to restock affected woodlands.

But with only a small percentage of trees likely to be impervious, millions will be left to wither and die.

Conservationists and landowners fear this approach will scar the countryside for generations.

Tim Mott, director of Natural Ecology Mitigation, says his company has developed a copper-based solution specifically designed to tackle tree disease.

Independent laboratory tests at Reading University have found it effective against the fungus, as well as a host of other tree pathogens.

But the firm has been unable to get on to the Government-funded shortlist of products for testing against ash dieback. Despite this, it is determined to get the treatment on to the market and is seeking £1.2million in private funding to undertake field trials.

Fourteen potential treatments are being considered by the Government but with no deadline for approval, many ash owners are becoming increasingly anxious.

Baron Imre von Maltzahn, who has 10,000 ash on his 400-acre Shelswell estate, near Bicester, Oxfordshire, said the Government’s approach was ‘baffling’.

‘I’m certainly in favour of trying to do something rather than just sitting on our hands, and would use a treatment if available,’ he said. Graham Taylor is managing director of Pryor and Rickett, a woodland management consultancy. He said several clients – from estate owners to those with a single ash – are willing to spend their own funds to protect their trees.

‘It is frustrating for those that just want to get on and try. They may well find the solution that the Government does not seem to want to find.’ 

Plant physiologist Dr Glynn Percival, who tested the treatment developed by Mr Mott’s firm, says ash dieback can be tackled.

‘It is a fungus and can be treated with a fungicide, as simple as that.

'The results for this new treatment are very positive. Although we have yet to carry out field trials, if I were a gambling man I would have no qualms saying that this product used in the right concentration will give control against ash dieback.’ 

A Department for Environment Food & Rural Affairs spokesman said: ‘Plant health experts are currently looking at potential treatments, but finding resistance to ash dieback is the best hope for the future of ash in the UK.’
