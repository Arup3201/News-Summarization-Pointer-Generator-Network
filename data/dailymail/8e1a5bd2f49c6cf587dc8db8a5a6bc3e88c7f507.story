A controversial ad campaign which says 'hold your breath for six minutes' has been removed and updated amid concerns it promotes an unsafe message to children.

To promote the current Dugong exhibition, the Sydney's Sea Aquarium ran a campaign, which included posters, featuring a picture of a Dugong and beside it a young girl holding her breath.

It read,' Do like a Dugong: Hold your breath for six minutes'.

But the message, although not meant to be taken literally, has sparked worried feedback that continuous breath-holding has been linked to the deaths of Australian children called shallow water blackout.

This is the controversial ad by the Sydney's Sea Aquarium which sparked concerns for promoting an unsafe message to children

The family of 12 year old Jack McMillan, who couldn't be revived after he was the victim of shallow water blackout near Wollongong, in January last year, spoke out on 60 Minutes about the dangers of children holding their breath underwater.

'He loved being in the pool, he'd just do lap after lap after lap,' Jack's mother Michele told 60 Minutes.

'He was holding his breath and challenging himself to see how many laps can I do.'

Michele jumped in the pool to try and tried to resuscitate him but she couldn't and he died.

The tragedy has prompted the family to raise awareness about the deadly and little known condition, which kills four times faster than drowning. 

Nic Fisher was another healthy young boy who also died of similar circumstances in 2001.

His sister, Carly, wrote to Mamamia about the day her brother died. 

'I returned home to find my 12 year-old brother Nic’s lifeless body, lying beside the pool,' she said.

'My dad and my aunty were performing CPR.'

There were concerns this poster promoted an unsafe message to children so the entire campaign by Sydney's Sea Aquarium was removed and updated

Shallow water blackout (SWB) is caused by competitive or continuous breath holding or by taking several deep breaths before diving under water

She told Mamamia, Shallow water blackout (SWB) is caused by competitive or continuous breath holding or by taking several deep breaths before diving under water.

'Swimmers pass out due to lack of oxygen and the delayed trigger to breathe means that water quickly fills the lungs.'

'This is how my little brother, a competent swimmer, water skier and healthy young kid, being supervised by two adults, was able to drown so quickly,' she said.

A change.org petition last month, which has now closed, called on the aquarium to 'pull down the misleading poster'.

'When the motive of the poster seems to tell children that Dugongs can hold their breath for six minutes, it is undoubtedly very misleading. It is very much accident prone,' said the petition's founder Bulson Lamgade.

'What if, out of excitement and imitation, our children tend to hold their breath for 6 minutes? What can be more fatal and disastrous than this?'

The Sydney's Sea Life Campaign was removed and updated after concerns rose it was promoting an unsafe message to kids, asking them to hold their breath underwater for 6 minutes, like a Dugong

'Please join me in asking the Sea Life Sydney Aquarium to pull down their poster and not misguide our children.'

A spokesperson for the Sea Life Sydney campaign said 'this specific advertisement is a part of a larger campaign, which is certainly not intended to encourage children to take any of the comparisons with the Dugongs literally, including the holding of one's breath for any period of time.'

'The campaign is rather intended for adults and children alike to interpret the comparisons of humans to Dugongs as a fun way to learn about the anatomy, personalities and quirks of our famous Dugongs, Pig and Wuru.'

'However, we do acknowledge this is a real issue and so have taken the steps to ensure our campaign doesn’t contribute further to it.'

'We have updated and removed this particular part of the ad campaign from everywhere except on the bus panels, which we are endeavouring to remove as soon as possible,' she said.
