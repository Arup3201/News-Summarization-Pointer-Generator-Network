The grandmother was murdered in a £1.6million mansion

A man has been arrested on suspicion of murdering a grandmother who was house-sitting for friends in a village that appeared in Midsomer Murders.

The 22-year-old was taken into custody over the death of Valerie Graves in Bosham, West Sussex, who was found dead in the £1.6million home where she was staying while the owners were away for Christmas.

Her body was discovered on December 30 in the secluded bungalow with her family.

Ms Graves' son Tim Wood paid tribute to his mother after her death as he pleaded for information into her killing.

The grandmother was murdered in a £1.6million mansion as she looked after the waterside property for friends over Christmas.

Surrey and Sussex Major Crime Team 
launched a murder investigation on December 30 after the body of 
Ms Graves, 55, was found in the secluded bungalow in Smugglers Lane, 
Bosham, West Sussex.

She and her family were looking after the house while the owners were away over Christmas.

Ms Graves was the mother of two grown-up children and a grandmother.

Her son Tim Wood had previously pleaded for information about the killing.

He
 said: ‘My mum was much loved and will be sorely missed by the whole 
family.

'She was a free spirit who enjoyed her life and was a talented 
artist.

‘She had lived in Scotland for about 10 years, a place she loved and which inspired her passion for art.

‘This has been devastating for the family and has come as a complete shock.

‘We would appeal to anyone who has any information about this, no matter how trivial it is, to contact the police to help us catch whoever has done this horrible act.’

Ms Graves, who had recently moved back to Sussex from Scotland to be closer to her family, was house-sitting at the property with her mother, sister and her sister’s partner while the owners holidayed abroad.

Police said she went to bed at 10pm on Sunday 29 December.

She was found dead in a rear bedroom by one of her three relatives at around 10am the following day in the bedroom where she had been sleeping.

A post-mortem examination revealed she had suffered significant head and facial injuries, but detectives have not confirmed whether a weapon had been used.

The death shocked the small community of Bosham, which featured in an episode of the ITV crime drama Midsomer Murders.
