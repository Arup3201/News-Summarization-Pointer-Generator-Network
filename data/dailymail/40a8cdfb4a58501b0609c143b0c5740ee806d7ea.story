Geoff became ill and ended up in hospital

Geoff Paul suddenly found himself being asked if he'd been working out or was following a new fitness regimen. However, he didn't take this as a compliment.

The Thames Water manager, who is just over 5ft 9in, had dropped from 13st to 10½ st in just a year, despite making no changes to his diet or exercise routine.

'I was petrified I had cancer,' says Geoff, 43, who lives with his wife Nicole, 36, a teacher, and their children James, seven, and Jacob, two, in South-East London.

After developing extreme fatigue and thirst, as well as needing to use the loo at night, he went to his GP.

The doctor thought his symptoms pointed to diabetes and checked Geoff's blood sugar. The reading was 13 (a normal reading is four to seven) and he was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes, which occurs when the body isn't making enough of the hormone insulin or the insulin it is making isn't working properly.

Insulin mops up sugar - or glucose - in the bloodstream, so it can be used by the cells for energy.

Geoff's age put him in the 'at risk' category for type 2 diabetes. As well as being over 40, other risk factors include being overweight, a family history of the condition or coming from South Asian or black communities.

Geoff was given metformin, which cuts blood sugar levels by reducing the amount of glucose produced and released by the liver, and a meter to monitor his blood sugar daily.

But his levels remained high and he continued to feel exhausted. Despite repeated visits to his GP, it wasn't until two weeks after his diagnosis when he was hospitalised with dangerously high blood sugar that doctors realised he didn't have type 2 diabetes - he had type 1.

With type 2 diabetes, the body produces less insulin; with type 1, the body produces none at all. This is because type 1 diabetes is caused by the immune system malfunctioning and attacking beta cells, the insulin- producing cells in the pancreas.

Around 400,000 people in Britain have type 1 diabetes, with one in five diagnosed over the age of 40. However, because the condition is traditionally thought to begin in children and younger people, doctors may be missing cases in adults.

When Home Secretary Theresa May was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes last year aged 56, doctors first thought she had type 2.

Geoff, too, had been told by his GP that he was the wrong age to have the condition.

Experts warn this is a common mistake and can have serious consequences. The only way type 1 diabetes can be treated is with regular insulin injections or an insulin pump.

People with type 2 diabetes are offered insulin only if other treatments stop working.

The risk is that patients who are misdiagnosed with type 2 end up with dangerously high blood sugar and can be put at risk of the life-threatening condition diabetic ketoacidosis.

Without insulin, the body cannot use glucose in the blood for energy, so it breaks down fat and muscle for fuel instead. The by-products of this process are ketones, poisonous chemicals, which can build up and make the body acidic and cause dehydration.

This can cause heart problems, kidney failure and even swelling of the brain, leading to coma and death. The lack of awareness about late-onset type 1 diabetes may be leading to some patients becoming seriously ill, according to a study earlier this year by the Royal Gwent Hospital.

The study's co-author, Professor Peter Evans, highlighted the case of a 77-year-old female patient who suddenly developed diabetic ketoacidosis due to type 1 diabetes. Geoff also suffered from this complication and spent four days in hospital.

One possible cause of late-onset type 1 is a group of viruses called coxsackie B viruses. Most of us get these as children, but they can be caught in adulthood and cause illnesses from colds and mild gut problems to myocarditis (inflammation of heart muscle).

The viruses seem to trigger the body's immune system to malfunction and start slowly attacking the insulin- producing beta cells in the pancreas.

'This can sometimes happen quickly, bringing on type 1 diabetes within weeks, but for most the beta cells are killed more gradually,' says Libby Dowling, a clinical advisor to Diabetes UK. 'Physical or mental stress - such as another virus, exam stress or surgery - can tip the body over the edge (because the stress requires a surge of glucose to repair damaged cells in the body) and suddenly type 1 diabetes occurs.'

But even without stress, type 1 diabetes is inevitable because the virus has led to the beta cells being destroyed.

Another risk factor for late-onset type 1 diabetes may be having other auto-immune conditions, says Dr Parijat De, an endocrinologist at NHS City Hospital, Birmingham and BMI Priory Hospital.

Geoff suffers from a number of auto-immune conditions - rheumatoid arthritis (inflammation of the joints), ulcerative colitis (inflammation of the lining of the colon) and vitiligo (this causes loss of skin pigment). 'When I was diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis at 30 I was warned I may develop other auto-immune conditions,' he says. 'But my GP didn't consider that when diagnosing type 2 diabetes.'

Doctors should always investigate weight loss, says Libby Dowling: 'Alarm bells should ring with GPs if patients with high blood sugar have lost a lot of weight, even those over 40.

'Type 1 symptoms come on over weeks and months while type 2 manifests gradually over years.'

Dr De suggests type 1, not 2, should be considered if patients aren't overweight.

It was a sudden drop in weight that lead to Sandra Johnson being diagnosed.

The 51-year-old administrator was diagnosed in February 2011 after she lost a stone in just three months without dieting. She also suffered from thirst and lethargy, and developed leg pains, a less common symptom that occurs because high blood sugar can damage the nerves.

She was admitted to hospital after her GP tested her blood sugar levels - at 27, they were alarmingly high.

'The doctor at the hospital wasn't sure if I had type 1 or 2, saying usually younger people had type 1, so it was less likely I'd have it at my age,' says Sandra, who lives with her husband Karl, 45, a structural engineer, in Derby, and has two grown-up children.

'I knew type 2 was linked to diet, so I just thought I'd eaten too many sweets and cakes.'

She stayed in hospital for four days to stabilise her blood sugar and was diagnosed with type 1 two weeks later.

'The doctors were surprised due to my age. I was shocked, especially when they explained I'd need insulin for life.'

Doctors said a virus may have been to blame - she'd recently had a cold.

To ensure that all patients receive the correct diagnosis, Dr De recommends that where high blood sugar levels are accompanied by sudden or unexpected weight loss (or where the patient is not overweight), the GP should talk to a diabetes specialist.

They should also consider testing the patient's blood for immune GAD (glutamic acid decarboxylase) antibodies. These attack the beta cells during an auto-immune reaction.

'Type 1 patients are more likely to have these, so this can indicate if an older person has type 1 or 2,' says Libby Dowling.

'Another blood test checking for C-peptide, a breakdown product created when insulin is produced, is also useful to determine what type of diabetes patients have.'

The presence of C-peptide suggests it might be type 2.

Geoff and Sandra want GPs to listen to this advice. Geoff, who monitors his blood sugar levels and injects insulin daily, says: 'There's a mindset that type 1 diabetes affects only young people and that's why I was fitted into the type 2 category - but this could have cost my life.'
