British record signing Angel di Maria has admitted being 'extremely humbled' by his inclusion in the FIFPro World XI, presented at the Ballon d'Or awards ceremony on Monday.

The Manchester United winger was the only player currently plying his trade in the Premier League that was selected for FIFA's world XI, although the voting would have been based on his exploits for Real Madrid and Argentina last year.

The 26-year-old attended the event in Zurich - where former United star Cristiano Ronaldo picked up a third Ballon d'Or - and counted the recognition of of more than 20,000 fellow professionals as a 'huge honour'.

'It was a privilege and an honour to be named in the FIFPro World XI at the Ballon d'Or ceremony in Zurich on Monday,' Di Maria told ManUtd.com. 'To be named among the world's elite players is truly humbling.

'Since I was a young boy, all I have ever wanted to do is play football, so to receive awards like this is an added bonus. It was a great night and I'd like to thank everyone who voted for me.'

Di Maria won helped La Decima (a record 10th success) in the Champions League with Real Madrid and helped Argentina reach the World Cup final before his summer move to Old Trafford  - where he says he wants to help put United back at the top of the game.

'From the start of the season to now, you can see we've grown,' he says. 'We weren't great at the beginning but we've started getting a few victories under our belts.

'There are some people saying that we're not playing in a particularly good style or that it's not the old Manchester United - but it's not. 

'We're beginning something new here. We've got a new style, we've got a new manager and we're all working hard to make sure we're putting Manchester United back where it belongs.'
