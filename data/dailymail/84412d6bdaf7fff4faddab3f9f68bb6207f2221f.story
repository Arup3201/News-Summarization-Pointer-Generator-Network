Neil Warnock needs to learn when to keep his mouth shut is the message from Crystal Palace co-owner Steve Parish.

The Eagles manager was fined £9,000 earlier this month after claiming that referee Craig Pawson had been influenced by Chelsea players during the home defeat against the Premier League leaders in October. Pawson had sent off Damien Delaney at Selhurst Park, with Warnock inferring that there were double standards at play after John Terry didn’t receive similar treatment.

And, while Warnock admitted to his faults three weeks ago, Parish has reiterated that he must bite his tongue more in future.

‘I don’t think Neil should complain about referees,’ Parish told the Evening Standard. ‘I’ve told him that. I don’t think it helps us with matches.

‘I don’t think a manager should do anything other than try to help his club.’

While Warnock’s conduct has been an important recent issue, so too have performances under his stewardship.

That, however, took a turn for the better on Sunday with the 3-1 demolition of Liverpool.

It has the enthusiastic Parish dreaming of Europe.

‘There’s no reason why Palace can’t cement itself as a Europa League challenging club. The Champions League is really difficult for any club outside the top four or five.

‘You might get the odd wild card. The next level down - right down to ninth - is very flat now.’

And he doesn’t see a problem in bridging the gap between Palace and those who consistently occupy the European places in the top flight.

‘Everton probably have about £10-11million more non-TV income than us, that’s it,’ he added. ‘So it’s not like the old days when their gate money was a significant differentiator in the ability to spend and compete.’
