When Pascale Honore was left paralysed in a car accident 18 years ago, she had to 'relearn to live a different way' and accept 'suddenly all the things I loved doing I couldn't do anymore.'

But now the wheelchair bound 50-year-old from Adelaide, Australia, has been given a new lease of life after discovering the joy of surfing thanks to her son's friend, Tyron Swan, 23.

He takes to the waves with her strapped to his back with duct tape.

Surf's up: Pascale rides the waves on the back of Tyron Swan

Challenge: Rising to his feet, Tyron said he has enjoyed learning to balance on his board with an extra 40kg

Joy: The mother who was paralysed in a car accident said it's a dream come true to be able to surf

MailOnline reported on  Paris-born Pascale's inspiring story last month. Now a newly released video captures the exhilaration she feels as she rides the ocean waves with Tyron and splashes into the surf.

Pascale's two sons love to surf and she used to look on with envy as they took to the sea with their friend. The selfless surfer then came up with an ingenious way to allow Pascale to join in their fun.

New hobby: Wheelchair bound Pascale found all the things she loved doing she 'couldn't do anymore' - but was able to surf for the first time thanks to Tyron

All aboard: She is strapped to Tyron's back using duct tape

Secure: The technique has been perfected so she has no danger of slipping

He said: 'When we first came up with the idea, I 
thought "I wonder if you can surf on the same board? I could duct tape 
you to my back and surf, I don't see why not."'

He added he enjoyed seeing if the balancing act could be done.

'If I can do what I normally do with 40 extra kilos, it's pretty good challenge, really,' he said.

The video, shot by Mark Tipple, follows Pascale as she is strapped to Tyron's back using tape and they head into the ocean.

Heading into the waves: Pascale said she hopes her story inspires others to believe their dreams can come true

In the surf club: Now Pascale can join her sons as they pursue their favourite hobby

The camera tracks the pair as Tyron jumps into position on the surf board and rides the waves with Pascale clinging on with a beaming smile.

She recalls the wonder she felt the first time she took to the water with Tyron: 'I remember looking up, the colour, the sound, being part of everything, being part of the water, I can't find 
words to explain it.'

She added that surfing with Tyron allows her to join in with her sons as they pursue their favourite hobby and feel like she can stand again.

'Being taped there at the same height, I felt like it was me,' she said.

Under the sea: Pascale can even go scuba diving with Tyron

Hope: The pair, who live in Australia, are delighted their story has inspired others around the world

Tyron said he didn't realise how their story could touch so many people until word of their unusual surf pairing spread across the globe.

'It's changed her life in a way I think,' he said. 'I didn't think about it too much until people started saying how much it inspired them.'

Pascale said she hopes her experience can encourage other people to never give up hope.

She said: 'It's shown me you can still have a dream and things are possible... concentrate on the positive in life.'
