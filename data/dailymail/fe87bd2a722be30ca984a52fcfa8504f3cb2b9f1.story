Arjen Robben has admitted it 'wasn't easy' to work under Jose Mourinho at Chelsea due to the injury problems that plagued the early stages of his career.

Bayern Munich winger Robben spent three seasons under The Special One between 2004 and 2007, winning two Premier League titles, an FA Cup and two League Cups.

But despite his key role in Mourinho's first-era Chelsea side, the Dutchman says his frequent spells out with injury meant that things didn't always work out as he would have wanted.

The 31-year-old winger praised the Portuguese coach's role in his development but felt that Mourinho's dislike for players who get injured made things difficult for them both before he eventually moved to Real Madrid for £24million in 2007.

'It was very good to work with him (Mourinho) at that age because I was young and with Mourinho you have to be mentally very strong,' Robben said.

'You have to jump on the train with him or you're off. So it was great for my development.'

Robben did not make his Chelsea debut until October in his first season at Stamford Bridge due to a broken metatarsal suffered in pre-season but he went on to form an impressive partnership with Damien Duff as Mourinho's men went unbeaten in the league for the rest of the campaign.

'It was hard at first because I came with an injury,' Robben told The Guardian. ' It was very difficult for me and also for him. Of course, he doesn’t like players who get injured.

'So it wasn’t easy but I always had the feeling I had his confidence. I played some great games for Chelsea but it was unfortunate I had injury problems and I couldn’t do it over a long period – like now.'

Robben still retains good memories of his time in London though - and reserved particular praise for the much-maligned hectic festive period, although he added: 'playing four games in 10 days is crazy.'
