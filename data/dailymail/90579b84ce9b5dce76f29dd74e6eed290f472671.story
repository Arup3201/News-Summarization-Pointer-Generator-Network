Every day Sportsmail takes a look at the European papers to see what are the biggest stories creating talking points on the continent.

In Spain, Marca lead with a potentially huge summer transfer by claiming that Napoli striker Gonzalo Higuain is on the verge of joining Barcelona.

The Argentine, who is part of his country's squad at the World Cup, only joined Rafa Benitez's side from Real Madrid last summer but the paper say he is 'very close' to a move to the Nou Camp.

According to Marca, Higuain has agreed to join Luis Enrique's side but the La Liga giants are yet to come to an agreement with Napoli.

AS focus on Spain's World Cup campaign, with midfielder Xabi Alonso claiming that Vicente Del Bosque's side aren't finished despite their 5-1 thrashing at the hands of Holland on Friday.

There is also a mention for Real star Cristiano Ronaldo, who will come up against team-mate Sami Khedira and former team-mate Mesut Ozil when Portugal take on Germany.

The 29-year-old has been struggling with injury in recent weeks and he admits he cannot remember a game in his career where he has not felt pain.

Portuguese papers Record and A Bola go big on Ronaldo ahead of the Group G clash at the Arena Fonte Nova.

The former say that 'This is the year for Portugal', while the latter claim that Ronaldo will be at the centre of the universe come Monday afternoon in Brazil.

Over to Italy and Tuttosport react to the impressive performance of Matteo Darmian in Italy's 2-1 win against England on Saturday evening.

Juventus defender Giorgio Chiellini claims that the right-back deserves to leave Torino for a club playing in the Champions League, although manager Cesare Prandelli urges the media and fans not to ruin his impressive debut by getting carried away.

The same paper also claim that Juve want to sign River Plate's Eder Alvarez Balanta and Fiorentina's Juan Cuardrado, while Inter Milan are keen on Zenit's Domenico Criscito.

La Gazzetta dello Sport also lead Italy's victory against Roy Hodgson's side, picking out their record-breaking pass completion rate of 93% - the highest recorded at a World Cup finals.

Match-winner Mario Balotelli is also selected for praise, with the paper using his 'Super Mario' nickname after his header sealed a 2-1 win in Manaus.
