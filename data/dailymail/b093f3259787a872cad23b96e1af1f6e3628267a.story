Michael Clarke could return for the World Cup in February after successful surgery on his right hamstring.

The 33-year-old Australia Test skipper feared he might never play again after pulling out of the series against India after last week’s first Test in Adelaide. Steve Smith was appointed as his replacement.

However, Australia physio Alex Kountouris said: ‘Speaking to the surgeon, everything went really well. There were no surprises and he’s managed to do a good repair, and from that he’s very confident that Michael is going to make a good recovery.

‘Our aim is for him to take part in the World Cup.’

That was the only good news for Australia on the injury front yesterday as their bowling attack fell apart on the first day of the second Test in Brisbane.

In stifling heat, all-rounder Mitch Marsh limped off with a hamstring strain, debutant Josh Hazlewood left the field with cramp, Mitchell Starc struggled with a sore back and ribs and paceman Mitchell Johnson was bothered by a sore finger after fielding a ball.

Coach Darren Lehmann, already dealing with the absence of Clarke and seamer Ryan Harris, used 12th man Peter Siddle in the field for much of the day and a local grade cricketer as a substitute

Lehmann revealed he even had 44-year-old spin coach John Davison ready to go on in case of further injuries. India reached 311 for four at stumps, with Murali Vijay hitting 144 as India look to level the four-match series. 

‘It was challenging but when you are playing for your country you’ve got to do your stuff to the best of your ability,’ said Vijay. ‘You can only go close to perfection — I think I did pretty well.’
