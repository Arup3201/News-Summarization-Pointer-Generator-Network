Two wealthy couples who spent £500,000 on a venomous legal battle over ‘a few feet’ of muddy ditch between their homes have been slammed by judges for their 'absurd' waste of money.

The couples each lavished six-figure sums on the dispute about a drainage ditch running alongside a bridle path between their properties in Cheshire.

Today judges ruled on an appeal launched by one of the couple's, giving sole ownership of the lane while allowing the other couple limited usage.

But they criticised the toxic legal battle, calling it 'Dickensian' and pointing out that it had lasted longer than some murder trials. 

Bitter: The couples each lavished six-figure sums on the dispute about a drainage ditch running alongside a bridle path between their properties in Cheshire. Far right, the Hodgsons' property and left, the Gilkses'

Richard Gilks and his wife Heidi won a ruling in 2013 that stated they owned the ditch and and half of the adjoining track that runs next to their five-acre property in Mobberley. 

The couple use the route as a shortcut to Wilmslow – home to Sir Alex Ferguson and a host of other celebrities.

Their neighbours, Adrian Hodgson, 75, and his wife Joanne, 63 – who breed alpacas and wallabies – appealed the decision, fearing their animals were being disturbed by passing traffic. 

Judges ruled today that the disputed track falls entirely within the boundary of their home.

But the court also stated that the Gilkses still hold the right to drive vehicles along the path in one direction, but  only  for agricultural purposes.

And the couples were today criticised by judges who expressed 'dismay' at the trial, which had lasted longer than some murder trials.

Describing the dispute as 'depressingly unfortunate', Sir Stanley Burnton said: 'The costs so far approach half a million pounds, far more that the value of the rights involved'.

While Lord Justice Christopher Clarke described the couples' 'wasteful endeavours' in court as an 'absurd waste of effort'. 

Lord Justice Bean added: 'I only add how dismayed I have been by this Dickensian litigation'.

He pointed out that the toxic legal battle has taken up 13 days of court time, 'more than some murder trials'.

The area surrounding Mobberley and Wilmslow is home to football stars including Wayne Rooney, Louis van Gaal and Joe Hart. 

The Hodgsons' counsel, Caroline Hutton, said that the couples initially got on well after the Gilkses moved into their property in 2004.

However, they fell out bitterly over a planning dispute and then went to war over the ditch and the track.

The Gilkses won a ruling at Manchester County Court in December 2013, when Judge Ernest Armitage QC drew their boundary in the middle of Clay Lane.

Overturning that decision today, Sir Stanley Burnton ruled that the whole of the track belongs to Mr and Mrs Hodgson. 

However, through long useage, Mr and Mrs Gilks had acquired a right to drive agricultural vehicles along the lane, he said.

Lord Justice Bean today expressed his dismay at the toxic legal battle, describing it as an example of 'Dickensian litigation'. 

The statement references Charles Dickens' novel Bleak House, which was published in instalments between 1852 and 1853.

The novel dramatises the flaws in the Court of Chancery, which handled cases such as property disputes at the time, and was seen as an ineffective, expensive and technically difficult system. 

The plot is centered around the Jarndyce vs Jarndyce suit, which spans a number of years. 

Over the course of the litigation, the happiness and lives of those involved is destroyed as the family become obsessed with pursuing their claims and waiting for the long-expected judgement.

In the end, the costs of the case are found to have consumed the property in dispute. 

The right of way only runs east, and not south, from the property's gate and is for agricultural purposes only.

Lamenting the couples' decision to take the issue to the courts, Sir Stanley said: 'This is a dispute which could and should have been compromised on terms that both parties could live with'.

Lord Justice Bean added: 'The disputed strip of land and right of way do not constitute the sole means of access to anyone's home'.

'At a time when the courts are under great pressure, the battle between these two couples took up 10 days of court time - more than some murder trials - before Judge Armitage and three days in the Court of Appeal.

'About half a million has been spent in costs - it is as though...civil procedured reformers over the years have laboured in vain'.

Lord Justice Clarke said: 'The enmity of the parties has caused them to incur costs and to use up the time of the courts, to the detriment of other litigants, to an extent grossly disproportionate to what was at stake.

'If parties, or one of them, insist on litigating in this way, it is difficult for the court to cut short their wasteful endeavours, however much it may try to do so.

'I hope that the example of this litigation may encourage others who are concerned in like disputes...to take every step that they can to avoid the absurd waste of effort, time and cost, for both parties, which this case has  involved'.
