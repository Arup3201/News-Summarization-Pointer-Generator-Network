A pensioner who suffered years of torment from having 'How Much is that Doggie in the Window' playing  in her head, says the tune has finally stopped - only to be replaced by a new song.

Susan Root, of Coggeshall, Essex, has a rare form of tinnitus, also known as musical hallucinations, and hears constant music.

But after enduring four years of hearing the 1952 Patti Page novelty tune on loop, the 65-year-old says she is now being plagued by Judy Garland's 'Somewhere over the Rainbow', from the 1939 film The Wizard of Oz.

Plagued: Susan Root has been hearing 'How Much is that Doggie in the Window' in her heard for four years - only for the tune to change to Judy Garland's 'Somewhere over the Rainbow'

For the last two weeks, she says the music has been getting worse and now feels she is at breaking point. It plays in her head all day and even keeps her awake at night.

She said: 'It used to just be How Much is that Doggie in the Window but now I am getting all the different tunes.

'Now it is mostly Somewhere over the Rainbow.

'I also hear Happy Birthday now and again and Auld Lang Syne.

Mrs Root, a former school cleaner, suffers from musical hallucination, also called musical tinnitus. It means she hears tunes when nothing is being played.

She first heard How Much is that Doggie in the Window while working four years ago and has heard phantom music playing ever since.

'It's been terrible recently - it's just been constant for this past fortnight,' said Mrs Root, who retired as a cleaner at Honywood Community Science School last year after 27 years.

'I wake up hearing Somewhere over the Rainbow.

According to the British Tinnitus Association, musical hallucination (MH), also known as musical tinnitus, is the experience of hearing music when none is being played.

Hearing sound that no-one else can hear is quite common, but the experience is normally of a simple sound such as a buzzing, ringing, or sizzling: this is known as tinnitus. 

In a small number of people however, these experiences can be more complex and emotive, and music can be heard.

Although anyone can experience MH, it is more common in women than in men, as well as in those over 60 years of age.

Individuals who live alone, and those with hearing loss are also more likely to experience MH.

Some people with MH are worried that it might represent a mental health condition, such as schizophrenia.

Although in schizophrenia it is common to hear voices, it is in fact very rare to experience MH and there is thought to be no connection between the two conditions.

'It's worse at night because it is quieter.

'I am getting really fed up, people think it is funny but they don't understand - it's hell.

'I just want it to stop. I have to have the TV on when I try to go to sleep to drown out the noise.'

Mrs Root, who sometimes hears clicking or whistling instead of music, said doctors, neurologists and therapists have all failed to make the problem go away.

She has also tried listening to calming sounds, such as waves crashing and birdsong.

She has had ear problems since she was young, including infections, a perforated ear drum, problems with her balance and has undergone two operations.

Mrs Root, who has been married to retired lorry driver Graham since 1974, said: 'He shouts at me because I can't hear very well.'
