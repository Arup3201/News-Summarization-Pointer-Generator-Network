Twitter has released an animated heatmap showing the exact times and locations of tweets mentioning Ferguson or #Ferguson on Monday.

The map lights up from 8.30pm, which is when  St. Louis County Prosecutor Bob McCullough announced the grand jury's conclusion that 'no probable cause exists' to indict Officer Darren Wilson.

A separate TwitterReverb post showed that around 52,200 tweets per minute were sent at the time of Mr McCullough's announcement. 

As he made his public statement on Monday evening, Mr McCollough mentioned how the investigation had struggled with the social media and mainstream news coverage.

'The most significant challenge encountered in this investigation has been the 24-hour news cycle and its insatiable appetite for something, for anything, to talk about,' he said.

'Following closely behind were the nonstop rumors on social media.' 

The decision not to charge Officer Wilson with murder was followed by protest and riots in Ferguson, Missouri on Monday night, which spread to several other cities, including Washington D.C. and New York.

By Tuesday night, tens of thousands of people in more than 170 cities across America - including Atlanta, Boston, Philadelphia, and Los Angeles, among others - were demonstrating against the long-awaited verdict. 

However, despite the St. Louis grand jury decision, federal investigations into the shooting of Michael Brown continue the US Attorney General said on Monday.

The Justice Department will continue to pursue two investigations, one into potential civil rights violations by Officer Wilson when he shot dead  unarmed Brown in August this year, and one into the practices of the Ferguson Police force.
