A Utah mother accused of killing six newborn babies was addicted to meth and didn't want the responsibility of being a parent, police said.

Megan Huntsman is facing six first-degree murder charges after her estranged husband Darren West found a tiny body in a sealed container.

DNA results confirmed on Tuesday that West was the father of the six babies believed to have been strangled or suffocated, as well as a seventh believed to be a stillborn.

Claims: Megan Huntsman, who is facing six murder charges, was allegedly addicted to meth and didn't want to care for her babies, police say

Tests: DNA results show Huntsman's estranged husband Darren West fathered the babies. He is not a suspect

Huntsman, 39, allegedly said she had not been concerned about her babies' health, and didn't want to care for them, authorities told AP.

Pleasant Grove police captain Mike Roberts said the 39-year-old was addicted to meth at the time the babies died, from 1996 to 2006.

Police had previously declined to discuss a motive in the alleged murders. All seven babies were found in a garage at Huntsman's home, and had been carried to full term.

DNA results from the FBI also revealed the sex of the babies, confirming that five had been girls and two were boys.

Huntsman, who told police she strangled or suffocated six of the babies, is in jail on $6 million bail. She has not entered a plea.

Her husband, West, is not a suspect in the case.

Crime scene: The bodies of seven newborn babies were found in the garage of Huntsman's home

Investigation: Police search the garage where Huntsman's husband found one of the seven bodies

He had been living with her during the decade the babies were killed, but from 2006 to January he was in federal prison on drug charges.

It was West who discovered the first body after opening a small white box covered with electrician's tape on April 12.

Documents state that West also told police he 
discovered the baby in a plastic bag with a strong chemical odor 
emanating from it.

West said there was no decomposition smell, just a chemical odor.

Police in Pleasant Grove discovered the six other dead babies after obtaining a search warrant for the house.

They were in boxes throughout the garage, wrapped in shirts or towels, documents show.

Huntsman
 told police in a phone conversation on the day the first body was found
 by her husband that the baby was stillborn, and she had been  afraid to
 go to police or a hospital, the search warrant affidavit says,

She didn't say why she was scared.

Grim: Huntsman, pictured in court on April 21, told police she had strangled or suffocated six of the babies

Authorities reported finding bloody leather gloves and women's underwear in the garage, and infant booties and clothes in the master bedroom.

Police took stained sections of a mattress in the master bedroom as evidence.

During a brief first court appearance in Provo, the shackled Huntsman mostly kept her eyes focused downward as she was informed of the charges.

Defense attorney Doug Thompson told reporters afterward that he has spoken with Huntsman and she seemed fine, though he declined to provide details on her state of mind.

The FBI had been brought in to help analyze DNA results because no labs in Utah were able to examine the type of DNA taken from the small corpses, police said.
