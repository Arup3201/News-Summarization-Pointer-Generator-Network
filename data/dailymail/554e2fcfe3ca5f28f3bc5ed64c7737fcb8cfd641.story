Potty! The spa's clientele are fresh-faced with peachy plump skin - because they are babies

The towels are oh-so fluffy and the massage menu seductive, with its whispered promises of one-way, all-inclusive trips to planet bliss. The clientele are polished and gorgeous — all peachy plump skin, silky hair and Boden-chic.

They arrived today, driven past the monied and white stucco-fronted mansions of Kensington — just a stone’s throw from William and Kate’s residence, no less — in their 4x4s, to indulge in a little ‘me’ time at the local spa. A day to kick off the nappy and let the griping, winding and weaning stresses of the day float away.

Welcome to Britain’s first Baby Spa, where some very privileged tiny tots get to hang out in their own temperature-controlled pool, and catch-up on a few gurgles with some like-minded friends, before enjoying an indulgent baby massage.

Now I may be a new mother to six-week-old Felix, but when I heard about the spa I thought it sounded ludicrous. I’m slowly being introduced to the world of the modern middle-class mummy, with its baby yoga and infant reflexology classes.

But a spa? For babies? It did seem somewhat beyond the pale.

Not, however, according to founder Laura Sevenus, 68, who insists it’s no gimmick. Instead, she’s convinced that a half-hour session in the temperature-controlled, purified waters have a raft of therapeutic effects, helping babies sleep and even tackling typical baby ills such as colic.

She’s even invented a flotation device, known as a Bubby, which clips around the back of a baby’s neck and supports their head while the water buoys up their body, allowing babies an indulgent, ‘hands-free’ floating experience.

There are plans to roll out branches of the spa across Britain, although whether anyone other than wealthy Londoners will shell out the cool £60 per visit is anyone’s guess.

My web designer husband Andy is less convinced when I tell him of my and Felix’s plans for the day. ‘What exactly is the point?’ he asks me.

Just like a normal spa, the reception is a calm oasis of white walls, comfy sofas and soothing music, while there’s even a ‘chill-out room’ - except this one is equipped with comfy chairs and cushions for breastfeeding

I can sympathise. Like many women, I’ve visited the odd spa on hen weekends and girlie mini-breaks, but I’m inclined to think that paying a fortune to lounge around for hours by a Jacuzzi in a damp dressing gown is a bit of a waste of money.

Now I am about to find out whether I’ll feel the same way about this infant version, which is tucked away in a courtyard in one of London’s most exclusive postcodes.

Just like a normal spa, the reception is a calm oasis of white walls, comfy sofas and soothing music, while there’s even a ‘chill-out room’, except this one is equipped with comfy chairs and cushions for breastfeeding.

Beyond that though, it’s tiny, with just the one room housing a baby-sized pool and specially designed ‘neonatal pods’— resembling a row of top-loading washing machines — for bathers, each one the size and depth of a large sink and filled with purified water, and warmed to a precise 35.6 c for optimum comfort.

I am greeted by Laura, a stately but gentle South African. As this is my first visit, she asks some questions about Felix’s arrival.

No dummy: Founder Laura Sevenus has invented a flotation device, known as a Bubby, which clips around the back of a baby’s neck and supports their head while the water buoys up their body for a 'hands-free' float

A difficult birth, for example, might make a baby more sensitive to human touch. Felix certainly falls into this category: 11 days overdue, he came into the world after a marathon 60-hour labour ending in an emergency caesarean section and weighing a hefty 9lb 9oz.

It wasn’t exactly the calm and positive start in life that I had envisioned for him. Maybe a bit of spa time is just what we both need.

I worry he is a bit too young for such a new experience, but Laura reassures me that she has had babies little more than a day old in her spa, and water is something of a home-from-home for them after nine months in the womb.

Next it’s off to the spa room itself, where I find babies Annabelle and Maya already merrily bobbing about in the pool — their heads encased in what appear to be big purple doughnuts — their expressions a mixture of puzzlement and Zen.

I’m not sure whether it’s appropriate to burst out laughing, but they look as if they’ve accidentally got their heads stuck in a cushion. These are the Bubby flotation devices, which sit under the baby’s chin, keeping the mouth clear of the water, while allowing them to float and kick about safely.

Five and six months old respectively, their mothers Helene, 36, and Monisha, 33 — a smart and well-spoken pair — have been bringing them here once a week since they were tiny and both are convinced it has had therapeutic effects.

‘They sleep brilliantly every time they’ve been here, and seem more relaxed,’ Helene tells me. Moreover, she says, the visits have helped to clear up Annabelle’s colic.

This sounds promising, especially as both babies both look like they’re enjoying themselves, gurgling happily and flipping over like tiny mermaids in swimming nappies.

I’m more than happy for Felix to join them, but as it’s his first time, Laura feels it would be better to put him in a neonatal pod so that he feels more secure.

Laura gently fastens the flotation device round his neck before lowering him into the water, naked as the day he was born. I worry about the lack of swimming nappy, but Laura says she likes them to go au naturel to enhance their experience. This is Felix’s first skinny dip!

Long battle: The idea for the spa dated to the Seventies when Laura was a children’s swimming teacher

For a second or two Felix looks unsure, but then he relaxes, kicking his little legs and arms below the water. It strikes me it must be a nice feeling to stretch out vertically — so many newborn babies spend their lives hunched in their mother’s arms or swaddled in their cots.

He seems equally chilled out when we lift him out ten minutes later. Next it’s time for the massage, which Laura does using pure grapeseed oil, as it’s gentle on a baby’s skin. Asking me to watch so that I can repeat it at home if I wish, she uses surprisingly firm strokes, as otherwise, she tells me, the baby can think you are tickling them, which can feel irritating.

Laura even massages Felix’s back and the top of his buttocks — an area where babies apparently store a lot of tension from crying — and my son emits tiny little squeaks of pleasure. I’m impressed, it’s lovely to see Felix so relaxed.

As she works her magic Laura, herself a mother of three grown-up children, tells me that the idea for the baby spa dates back to the Seventies when she was a children’s swimming teacher and realised that the earlier a baby could be made to feel comfortable in water, the better.

Bobbing along: For those who feel it's pretentious nonsense... is there any price too high for a night's sleep?

The problem was finding a way babies could be supported so they can go it alone, enjoying a good old kickabout, without you having to climb in too.

The problem foxed her until, five years ago, her engineer husband Lars came up with the Bubby. The baby spa followed a year later, and has proved a success. Since it opened in 2010, between 16 and 21 babies a day have been wheeled through the doors.

Nonetheless, I can see why the mums keep coming back: within ten minutes of being popped back in his babygrow, Felix is snoozing in my arms, and remains zonked for the hour-long car journey home.

That evening, he goes to sleep more readily than usual, and lasts slightly longer until his first night-time feed — the Holy Grail for tired new mums. Even Andy is impressed, although it’s not enough to make him a convert. As far as he’s concerned, if we have a spare £60, it’d be better spent on something else — like a babysitter.

And, of course, many will also dismiss the baby spa as pampered nonsense for women with too much money. As for me — well, I find myself thinking that you can’t put a price on a good night’s sleep.
