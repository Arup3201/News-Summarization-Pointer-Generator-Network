The Sun newspaper printed the controversial naked pictures of Prince Harry because Rupert Murdoch wanted to 
fire a warning shot at Lord Justice Leveson, it has been claimed.

News 
International has refused to comment on the speculation, but Mr Murdoch took to Twitter to say the decision to publish them was taken to show that 
there is no such thing as a free press in the UK.

He took to social media to explain why the tabloid newspaper became the first British publication to print the images of the prince partying in Las Vegas, before going on to claim he supported the humiliated royal.

Mr Murdoch, 81, denied taking the decision to print the photos but said he agreed with the move.

Political argument: Rupert Murdoch claimed the naked pictures of Harry in Vegas were printed in The Sun to demonstrate that there was no such thing as a free press in Britain

Controversy: Mr Murdoch, CEO of News International, claims the decision to publish the photos was not his but that he supports it

'We needed to demonstrate no such 
thing as a free press in UK,' he tweeted. 'Internet makes a mockery of 
these issues. 1st amendment please.'

But according to a source reported in the Independent, Mr Murdoch told News International chief executive Tom Mockridge: 'There is a principle here. I know this is about Leveson but this is humiliating.

'We can't carry on like this. We should run them, do it and say to Leveson, we are doing it for press freedom.'

Later, however, Mr Murdoch echoed the view of a large proportion of the public by insisting he sympathised with Harry.

He tweeted: 'Prince Harry. Give him a break. He may
be on the public payroll one way or another, but the public loves him, 
even to enjoy Las Vegas.'

More than 850 complaints have been made 
to press watchdog the PCC about the publication of photographs of the
prince frolicking naked with a young woman in Friday’s edition of The Sun.

Nearly all are about invasion of privacy and are to be investigated in due course.

In a Twitter exchange with former deputy
prime minister John Prescott, Mr Murdoch denied the claims, writing: 'Decision was rightly that of the editor, and I support. I was in Silicon Valley far removed.'

The Sun argued that 
printing the images was in the public interest and a 'crucial' test of 
the country’s free press.

Finger on the pulse: Mr Murdoch, 81, followed up by echoing the thoughts of much of the public by expressing support for the wayward Prince

Mr Murdoch later added on Twitter: 
'Simple equation: free, open uncontrollable Internet versus shackled 
newspapers equals no newspapers. Let's get real.'

He concluded the discussion with the advice: 'Only lesson for Prince Harry: avoid playmates with cameras!'

TMZ, the celebrity gossip website that first published the pictures, said they were taken last Friday after 
Harry and his entourage met a group of young women in a hotel bar and invited them 
up to the royal’s suite.

The group played strip billiards and 
someone in the party is thought to have captured the images of the naked
prince on a camera phone.
