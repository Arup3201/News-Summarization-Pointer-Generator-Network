Toni Kroos is set to pack his things and head to Old Trafford, but one thing should remain clear: Louis van Gaal did not make the midfielder the player he is today. 

While Kroos no doubt established himself as a prominent Bayern player under Van Gaal, the Dutchman’s influence was nothing compared to that of the man who coached Kroos before and after him: Jupp Heynckes.

It was under Heynckes that he first played regular Bundesliga football. It was under Heynckes that he finally became a crucial figure for Bayern and the national team.

Kroos joined Bayern as a 16-year-old 
from East German club Hansa Rostock in 2006. By Christmas 2008, he was 
still yet to prove himself as a first-team player, and then Bayern coach
 Jurgen Klinsmann let him out on loan to Bayer Leverkusen.

There, he had his first taste of working under Jupp Heynckes.

Despite injuries hindering him in the early months, Kroos soon began to shine at Leverkusen. Under Heynckes, he could fulfil the two roles for which he is now famous: the space-creating No 10 with the vicious shot, and the game controlling No 6 with an astute tactical awareness.

Upon his return to Bayern in the summer of 2010, Kroos did thrive under Van Gaal, and impressed hugely before Christmas, at a time when Bayern had an injury crisis in attacking midfield.

By the time Van Gaal left Bayern in the usual storm of tears and internal politics, Kroos was a well-established figure at the Allianz, though questions remained over his role in the team.

Then, Heynckes turned up again, this time as Bayern coach. Kroos greeted his arrival by saying: 'He is the coach in professional football who has always given me his constant trust and support. It’s a stroke of luck for me that he’s coming'.

It was in 
the following two seasons, from 2011 to 2013, that Kroos really became a
 force. It was in those seasons where he became recognisable across 
Europe, both on club and international level.

With
 fame and responsibility, of course, comes sharper criticism. Though few
 doubt his talent, many have accused Kroos of being a lazy player in the
 last few years.

That is an impression shaped largely by memories of his poor performance against Andrea Pirlo at Euro 2012. Kroos’ sluggishness on that day has haunted him since but in truth he rarely tears around.

He may not sprint around the place like Usain Bolt but his positioning and his ability to create space are beyond doubt. Those are skills which Henyckes brought out of him.

Of all the players of the Van Gaal era linked with United so far, it's no surprise that 
Kroos has secured a move to Manchester United. Thomas Muller may have a 
stronger relationship with the new United coach, but he, like Bastian 
Schweinsteiger, is also Bayern Munich through and through. The two 
players eat, drink and sleep Bayern.

Kroos, on the other hand, is an East German, a one-time Werder Bremen fan, and a pragmatist.

He has worked under Van Gaal successfully before, and knows he can fit into the Dutchman’s system. But the move will be about money, and Kroos wanting a new experience. Not sentimentality for the man who brought him stardom.

The man who did that is not manager of Man United. He’s enjoying a well earned semi-retirement.
