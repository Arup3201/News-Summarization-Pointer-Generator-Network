A woman who launched a tirade of foul-mouthed racist abuse towards another passenger is being hunted by police.

The unidentified woman swore repeatedly repeating ‘If your country is so good, f*** off back there’ at a man sitting next to her on an eastbound District line train.

Another passenger filmed the three-minute rant and posted it on YouTube which prompted British Transport Police to launch an investigation into the shocking alleged incident.

Do you know this woman? Police released this image of the woman, urging anyone who witnessed the incident to come forward

'You're so thick you don't even get it.'

The police today released an image of 
the woman. They said the date and time of the alleged attack is unclear.
The video was posted on April 11.

Detective Constable Lawrence Murphy said: ‘We have isolated images of a woman we believe may be able to help us with our investigation into the incident.

‘We believe the footage was filmed on an eastbound District line train, which passed through Stepney Green Tube station and Mile End station.

‘At this stage, we urge anyone who witnessed this incident, or who recognises the woman, to get in touch and help us build up a full picture of exactly what took place.

‘We treat all allegations of racism very seriously and urge anyone with information about this incident to contact us.’

Anyone with information should contact British Transport Police on 0800 40 50 40 or Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.

Last year Jacqueline Williams, 47, was charged with a racially aggravated public order offence after she was filmed hurling racist abuse at train passengers. After the video, which shows a woman taunting a group of black passengers, was posted on YouTube she was arrested.

Elizabeth Ward-Buck, 51, was spared jail earlier this year after she was filmed verbally abusing two female students in the waiting room at Ipswich Hospital.

She asked the women where they were from, then shouted: ‘You're coming over here and you're pleading poverty. We are paying taxes you a***holes and we are going down in this crisis.’

The aggressive woman was taken to a side room by police, but she continued her rant and even tried to assault a police officer.
