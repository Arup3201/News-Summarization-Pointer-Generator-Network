Meanwhile, other designs for larger tortoises have taken Mrs Bradley several days to make.

Mrs Bradley, from Vancouver, Washington, US, has eight tortoises of her own.

She said: 'The idea initially started out as a family joke when I saw a picture online of a tortoise with a doily on its back.

'I thought it would be funny if I made one, so I crocheted a cozy for one of my tortoises.

'When I first put it on, the tortoise looked so silly, we just laughed and laughed.

'I posted a picture on a tortoise forum and people started asking me to make one for their tortoise and it went from there.

Jaws: A shark outfit is one of the suits Mrs Bradley creates

Festive: A tortoise models one of the more festive offerings

'I started coming up with new, more creative designs.'

Mrs Bradley, a mother-of-two, said the cozies are a 'fun item' that will 'put a smile on the tortoise keeper's face'.

She added: 'At the same time they do have a practical application in that they help a tortoise to be more easily visible during a short stroll on the lawn.

'The tortoises don't seem to mind having them on, they just go about whatever they were doing.

'I have made more than 600 - probably closer to 750 or 800 at this point. I currently have to make four or more every day to keep up with the orders.

Reaction: 'The tortoises don't seem to mind having them on, they just go about whatever they were doing,' said Mrs Bradley

Orders: 'I currently have to make four or more every day to keep up with the orders,' said Mrs Bradley

In demand: Mrs Bradley estimates she has between 750 or 800 of the outfits so far
