They are now frail old ladies. But nearly seven decades ago these women were serving as guards at Hitler’s death camps, shepherding hundreds of Nazi Germany’s victims to their deaths.

The women are among some 24 suspects now being investigated by prosecutors in Germany for their wartime roles as accomplices to mass murder.

Despite the fact there are no witnesses left alive to testify as to what they did, prosecutors hope that the mere fact of serving in a place of suffering and death will be enough to bring charges and guilty verdicts.

Horror: Prisoners produce weapons in the concentration camp of Dachau during World War Two

Last week a former Dachau guard 
identified only as Horst P, aged 87, was pictured at his Berlin home 
with a collage of photos of him in his SS uniform beneath the words Mein
 Kampf – the title of Adolf Hitler’s hate-filled blueprint for racial 
war.

Now the central 
authority for the prosecution of Nazi war crimes, based in Ludwigsburg, 
has sent out files on 24 more suspects, including three women.

Gertrud
 Elli Schmid, now 92 and living in Hamburg, is one of the suspects. She 
was formerly an SS guard at Majdanek in the Polish city of Lublin where 
an estimated 235,000 people were murdered during WW2.

Prosecutors
 have traced her SS identity card. After service in Majdanek she was 
sent to Auschwitz, also in occupied Poland, where 1.1million prisoners 
were exterminated.

Now 
wheelchair bound, she was tracked down by the daily newspaper Bild. Her 
daughter said: ‘We know that my mother had something to do with 
Auschwitz. We have tried to talk with her about it but her memory 
doesn’t really function any more.’

Another
 SS woman has been identified as Gisela S. Now 90, she lives in a care 
home in northern Germany. She too worked at Auschwitz.

Charlotte
 S, 94, was a guard at the women’s concentration camp of Ravensbruck 
where diarist Anne Frank was briefly incarcerated before being sent to 
her death at Belsen.

Ravensbruck
 held mainly women and Charlotte S is said to have been a terrifying 
figure who beat up  prisoners and unleashed her Alsatian dog on them.

Tried
 in Communist East Germany after the war, she was locked up for 15 
months for attacking prisoners and stealing from them, but this time 
prosecutors hope to charge her with accessory to murder.

A
 man on the list is Oskar Groening, cleared of war crimes in 1948. He 
served in Auschwitz as a clerk sorting through the clothes and 
possessions of the victims.

He said: 'I
 was an official in the prisoners' possessions administration which 
basically involved removing the money, jewels and other valuables from 
the inmates, registering it and sending it back to Berlin.

'They had diamonds and gold worth millions and it was my duty to make sure all of it got to Berlin.

'It
 was completely understood by all that the majority were going straight 
to the gas chamber, although some believed they were only going to be 
showered before going to work.

'Many
 Jews knew they were going to die. One time a drunken SS man discovered a
 crying baby on the platform. He grabbed the waif by its legs and 
smashed its head against the side of a truck. My blood froze when I saw 
it.'

He
 claims he applied for a transfer and fought in Belgium until his 
capture. He, too, now faces an  indictment of complicity to commit mass 
murder.

On one night in January 1943 he saw for the first time how the Jews were actually gassed.

'It
 was in a half-built farmyard near to the Auschwitz-Birkenau camp. A gas
 chamber was built there. We were searching the wood nearby for 
prisoners who had escaped,' he went on.

'There were more than 100 prisoners 
and soon there were panic-filled cries as they were herded into the 
chamber and the door was shut.

'Then a sergeant with a gasmask went to a 
hole in the wall and from a tin shook Zyklon B gas pellets inside.

'In
 that moment the cries of the people inside rose to a crescendo, a choir
 of madness. These cries I have ringing in my ears to this day.

'I again made an application for a 
transfer and at the end of October 1944 I was shipped to the Belgian 
Ardennes where I served with a fighting unit until capture. But you can 
imagine that down the years I have heard the cries of the dead in my 
dreams and in every waking moment. I will never be free of them.

'I
 have never been back there because of my shame. This guilt will never 
leave me. I can only plead for forgiveness and pray for atonement.'

He, too, is in the eye of prosecutors who believe him to be worthy of an indictment of guilty of complicity to mass murder.
