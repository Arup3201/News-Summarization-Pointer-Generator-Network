Obesity is a ‘slow-motion car crash’ which is threatening to bankrupt the NHS, according to its chief executive.

Simon Stevens said the problem is now more deadly than smoking and causing millions to suffer life-long illness and disability.

He also revealed that – absurdly – the NHS is spending far more on drastic weight loss surgery than trying to prevent the problem in the first place.

A quarter of adults and a fifth of children are now considered obese and the rates have almost doubled in 20 years. 

The NHS is spending far more on drastic weight loss surgery than trying to prevent the problem in the first place, its chief executive, Simon Stevens, has revealed 

And figures show the NHS spends anywhere between £5 billion and £9 billion a year treating obese patients and related complications such as diabetes.

Next month, Mr Stevens will publish a set of plans to tackle the problem which will see the NHS and private firms urged to do more to help staff lose weight.

Doctors and nurses will be encouraged to be healthy role models for patients and hospitals told to ban junk food from canteens.

NHS trusts and private companies will also be urged to help staff lose weight by holding slimming classes, running clubs or just providing bike racks at work.

Mr Stevens, who took up post last April, said: ‘Obesity is the new smoking, and it represents a slow-motion car crash in terms of avoidable illness and rising health care costs. 

‘If as a nation we keep piling on the pounds around the waistline, we'll be piling on the pounds in terms of future taxes needed just to keep the NHS afloat.’ 

Addressing a conference hosted by Public Health England in Coventry, he added: ‘It's bizarre that we are spending more nationally on bariatric surgery than we are on implementing at scale evidence-based programmes to prevent diabetes.

‘If we are serious about this then between NHS England and Public Health England we are going to have to switch some of our investment - not having futile arguments about who is paying for what.

He added: ‘There is a danger we are sleepwalking into an unhealthy future.

‘The NHS is not a national role model when it comes to supporting staff to stay healthy. Only a third of trusts give support to lose weight.

Mr Stevens also criticised WH Smith which encourages customers to buy supersized bars of chocolate for reduced rates alongside their magazine or newspaper.

Referring to own experience at a branch at London’s Euston station yesterday (Weds) morning, he added: ‘They didn't say would you like a banana with that they said how about the chocolate?'

The proposals unveiled next month are expected to call for companies to be offered tax incentives by the Government to encourage staff to be healthier. 

A quarter of adults and a fifth of children are now considered obese and the rates have almost doubled in 20 years.

This could mean they are given tax relief on national insurance if they install gyms, provide healthy food in canteens or arrange running clubs at lunchtime.

Hospitals and GP organisations will also be told to lead by example by offering fitness classes, support for staff trying to lose weight and by banning junk food.

Mr Stevens is also understood to be in favour of companies offering financial incentives for staff to lead healthier lifestyles.

He personally benefitted from such a scheme offered by his former company UnitedHealth, a private healthcare firm based in Minneapolis, the USA.

Mr Stevens, 48, was able to lose three stone he had put on through an unhealthy American lifestyle partly thanks to incentives which offer employees reduced health insurance for meeting certain goals.

Other companies provide shopping vouchers to staff for losing weight or maintaining their blood pressure within the healthy range.

Researchers estimate that the NHS spends £5 billion annually treating obesity although this doesn’t include the £9 billion annual bill for type 2 diabetes.

MrStevens added that obesity is now more deadly than smoking and causing millions to suffer life-long illness and disability.

And last year, the health service carried out 9,336 weight loss operations which typically cost between £5,000 and £15,000 a time, depending on the procedure.

This means that based on an average cost per operation of £10,000, the NHS spends nearly £100 million a year on weight loss surgery.

Mr Stevens also wants local councils to use lessons learned by New York where fast food chains are forced to display the calorie content of their products.

The city’s mayor, Michael Bloomberg, also attempted to ban the sale of supersized fizzy drinks last year although the law was thrown out by judge after the food industry appealed.

Barbara Young, chief executive of Diabetes UK, said obesity was the ‘greatest public health emergency we face today.;

‘The UK’s obesity rate is worryingly high and this has fuelled the massive rise we have seen in Type 2 diabetes over the last couple of decades.

‘We are now in a position where diabetes accounts for 10 per cent of the entire NHS budget and if things carry on as they are it will bankrupt our healthcare system.’

Duncan Selbie, chief executive of Public Health England, the Government agency responsible for tackling obesity said:’He rightly highlighted the health and economic costs to society if as a nation we do not act now.

‘His focus on reducing obesity in the NHS workforce and limiting high fat and sugary foods in hospitals is especially important as they are role models for the public.’
