The most poignant moment of my life was when my little brother, Enrico, drowned.

He was just 13 and I was 23 so I’d been like a father to him. He was a special boy and was following in my footsteps, gaining my passion for food and developing a love for gathering mushrooms from the fields.

He looked up to me and I was his mentor – it was the perfect sibling relationship.

The mushroom men: Like Antonio, younger brother Enrico developed a love for gathering mushrooms before he died

My life fell apart when the director
of the Olivetti typewriter company, where I was working, called me to 
one side and said, ‘I have to tell you something dreadful.’

My blood froze. Enrico had died swimming in the lake near our home at Borgofranco d’Ivrea where the water is extremely cold.

He
was the youngest of seven Carluccio children and I couldn’t envisage 
anything happening to him. I simply broke down and had to be taken home.

We
were always told never to go in the water in hot weather after eating 
as it can cause severe cramps and you can drown. But that’s what Enrico 
did – and he went down in five feet of water.

My
father was the first on the scene and for two hours tried to give him 
the kiss of life. We visited Enrico in the morgue that night, and to see
my little brother lying stiff and contorted on the marble is an image 
I’ve never been able to forget.

My father was devastated, and my mother never recovered.

A year later, I moved to Vienna to follow my girlfriend Gerda. It was a double loss for my parents, who didn’t want me to leave, but I had to escape the grief that had engulfed our family and myself.

It was there I learnt to cook. Then I became a wine merchant in Germany and never went home again.

I came to London in 1975, having married and divorced Gerda. Then I met my second wife, Priscilla Conran, sister of Sir Terence and head buyer at The Conran Shop.

She encouraged me to enter a cookery competition and, though I came second, my love of mushrooms sparked much media interest and led to Terence offering me the job of manager of Conran’s Neal Street restaurant in 1981, which I bought from him in 1989.

This became the platform, in 1991, for Priscilla and me to launch the Carluccio’s brand – an Italian restaurant/deli that now has 72 branches.

But I sold my shares five years ago because, to tell the truth, I’m not really a businessman.

Priscilla and I separated in 2008 and I began to suffer deep depression. I felt I’d never found proper happiness in life, probably because of Enrico’s death.

My depression got worse and I tried to take my life. But I’m glad I failed as I ended up at The Priory, which balanced me by encouraging me to explore my spiritual side.

Today I’m a consultant for Carluccio’s, and also love making the Two Greedy Italians TV shows with fellow chef Gennaro Contaldo.

I’ve also met a soul mate, Sabina, who’s an archaeologist. I feel the depression is behind me and I’ve regained my identity.

Enrico’s death taught me one crucial thing – you have to embrace change.

Two Greedy Italians Series 2 is available on DVD now, as is the accompanying book, Two Greedy Italians Eat Italy, published by Quadrille, £20.
