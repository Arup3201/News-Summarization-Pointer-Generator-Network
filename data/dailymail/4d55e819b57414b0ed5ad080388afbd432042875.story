Catch him if you can. Unfortunately for the entire MotoGP field in 2014, keeping pace with Marc Marquez has proved totally impossible this season. 

The world champion made it 10 wins from as many races this year after triumphing at Indianapolis on Sunday. The defending world champ shattered the series’ previous record for the youngest driver to win 10 in a row. Mike Hailwood was 24 years and 86 days old when he did it in 1964. Marquez is 21 years, 174 days.

With his dominance so great, questions of whether he will retain the title have long since passed - replaced with whether the Spaniard can clean sweep all 18 races this term. Marquez is the first rider since Mick Doohan in 1997 to win 10 successive premier class races.

High five: Marc Marquez celebrates in the Indianapolis paddock after winning his tenth straight race to keep him on course of winning every grand prix this term

Familiar feeling: Marquez has dominated MotoGP since stepping up from Moto2 in 2013 - finishing on the podium in 26 of his 28 races

Center of attention: Honda's Marquez celebrates winning the grand prix in Indianapolis alongside Yamaha's Jorge Lorenzo (left) and Valentino Rossi

If you thought Sebastian Vettel's iron grip over Formula One for the past four years was impressive, then Marquez's achievements are just as remarkable - if not better.

For instance, Marquez is in just his second year of MotoGP - winning the title in his rookie season.

And while he rides a factory Honda - arguably the best bike in the field - he is consistently leaving team-mate, Dani Pedrosa for dust at every grand prix.

Pedrosa isn't the only one struggling to keep pace with the 21-year-old. Seven-time premier class world champion Valentino Rossi and team-mate Jorge Lorenzo also can't beat Marquez this year and the Yamaha pair, as well as Pedrosa, are among the finest riders the sport has seen - at least in recent times.

Clear the way: Marquez won the MotoGP championship in his rookie season in 2013 and is set to dominate the sport in the future with his aggressive riding style

Coming through: Marquez (93) shows little fear when overtaking as he scythes past Lorenzo (99) and Rossi to take the lead at Indianapolis

First choice: Marquez is tied down to ride with Honda for the foreseeable future, with rivals including Lorenzo (right) struggling to match his pace on track

Since making his debut, last year, Marquez has finished on the podium in 26 of his 28 races - the two anomalies include a rare crash at Mugello last season, as well as a team mix-up resulting in his disqualification at Phillip Island, Australia.

It's a level of dominance that should on paper be boring, but Marquez's riding this year has not been simple lights to flags victories - he really has had to work for some of his wins.

His poor race starts need attention for instance, and it often leads to the Spaniard falling well out the top three on the first lap, whether he qualifies on pole or not.

But he has proven time and again this term he is more than capable of fighting through the field. Among the highlights of his victories include Le Mans where he came from 10th to pass Rossi and sprint off into the distance with half the race still to go..

My time is now: Marquez has built up a large fan following in MotoGP as he bids to take the sport into a new era

Still got it: Rossi has won just one race in the last four seasons but is still among the top riders in the sport at 35-years-old

Top dog: Rossi is still the most popular rider in the paddock having won an impressive seven premier class titles since 2001

While at the Sachsenring in Germany, he pitted before the race to switch on to dry tyres, but still scythed through the field unchallenged to claim victory.

His biggest test came at Mugello where late on he exchange in a highly entertaining duel with Lorenzo, beating his Spanish compatriot by just 0.1 of a second.

Since the start of the century, MotoGP's golden boy has been Rossi who still is by far the most popular rider even if his best days are coming to an end.

The Italian is a global 'fan favourite' but despite signing a new two-year deals with Yamaha, talks of who will lead the sport in the future have been asked for some time.

Casey Stoner has come and gone, Pedrosa and Lorenzo have led a challenge but Marquez's total dominance which has seen him smash records left, right and centre surely pave the way for the start of an exciting new era in the premier class of motor cycle racing.
