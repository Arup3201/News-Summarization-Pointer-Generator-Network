Robin van Persie appeared well rested in spite of football's silly season as the Manchester United striker strolled from a casual lunch with his wife Bouchra in Cheshire on Wednesday.

Van Persie and Bouchra visited The Grill on the Edge at Alderley Edge which specialises in steaks and 'no nonsense' British food. 

United are enjoying a relatively luxurious gap of seven days between matches after their win over Yeovil in the FA Cup Sunday and the visit of Southampton following a flurry of games over the Christmas and New Year period.

The Dutch striker was rested by Louis van Gaal for the journey to Somerset and watched the 2-0 win at home on television as Wayne Rooney, James Wilson and Radamel Falcao occupied the forward positions while Ander Herrera and Angel di Maria took care of the goals.

Van Persie played 90 minutes in the Red Devils' 1-1 draw in Stoke on New Year's Day and has 11 goals in 26 appearances so far this season after a slow start.

The Saints' visit on Sunday will be United's fifth game in the 17 days since Boxing Day, and the hosts take a relative degree of form into the match.

Van Gaal's side haven't lost in 11 matches, including 10 Premier League games, since falling to Manchester City 1-0 on November 2, and are now in third place behind Chelsea and City.

They are ruing the three draws in their past four league starts though as wins would have them three points adrift of the leaders instead of the current deficit of nine.
