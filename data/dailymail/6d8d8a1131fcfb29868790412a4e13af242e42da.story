Toddlers & Tiaras star Honey Boo Boo has launched her own reality show and is showcasing her crazy family along the way.

Although the six-year-old pageant star is supposed to be the star of TLC's new show Here Comes Honey Boo Boo, her outrageous family are stealing the limelight.

Last night's show followed the family as they visited their local Redneck Games, where Honey's sister 'Pumpkin' went bobbing for pigs' feet and her other sister 'Chubbs' tried out mud belly flop diving.

Meanwhile, mother June, who has been hoarding a lot of camera attention over the show, was spotted grinding against a man.

In another part of the show the
 coupon queen, as she is commonly referred to, is seen doing what she 
does best - discount shopping at a local auction house.

She eyes off loads of discounted food, including what looks 
to be multiple packets of sugary donuts, in what she describes as a 
'thrifty' way to shop, even though the entire family are supposed to be on a diet.

June explains she shops this way to save money because Honey's pageant 
dresses are 'so expensive'.Â 

Honey Boo Boo then buys a pet pig, 
which she names Glitzy and plans to take to pageants with her.

June, who was accused

 of 'doping' Alana, aka Honey Boo Boo, with caffeinated drinks and high 
sugar snacks in an episode of Toddlers & Tiaras in January, is seen 
narrowing her eyes towards her bargain-hunting competitors.

It seems that the sweets are certainly an object of desire in this neck of the woods.

The mother tells the camera: 'It [auction items] can be like half off of what you'd normally buy'.

She adds: 'Pageants are very, very expensive. It is not a cheap sport by any means. Sometimes he has what I'm looking for, sometimes he don't.'

She calls the weekly auction her 'favourite place' and even reveals that the family often find materials to create 'pageant props'.

'I'm a saving mommy... you save a little bit of money that way,' she says.

Alana's unruly antics helped her become the break-out star of Toddlers & Tiaras.

'If you're looking at my child in a sexual manner, there's not something wrong with me a parent'

But it seems there is no end to the mischievous ways of the youngster 
judging by these new trailers for her reality show.

The little girl and her mother even appeared on CNN this morning as part of the series' extensive promotional run ahead of its debut tomorrow night.

June addressed the child pageant industry as a whole, claiming that it never aims to sexualise children, which is a common accusation among critics.

'If you're looking at my child in a sexual manner, there's not something wrong with me a parent,' she said.

Child star: Honey Boo Boo told the show's hosts that she prefers 'hair and make-up' to being a 'normal person'

The show's hosts also quizzed the star of the show but Honey Boo Boo simply reiterated her love of child pageants.

'It's fun, I like it,' she said. 'I feel like a pageant queen... I like hair and make-up more [than looking like a] normal person.'

'We are a redneck,' she exclaimed suddenly before regurgitating her catch cry: 'You better redneck-onise!'

The tiny tot was also seen covered in mud in an earlier trailer for the show; she had launched herself into a giant mud pit.

A previous 30-second clip showed her
 attempting to dance after playing in the pit, wobbling around in front 
of the camera in the slushy dirt.

Alana is almost incoherent as her speaking manner is so bizarre.

According to the network, the six-part series will see the family 'doing what [they] do best: four-wheeling through mud pits and picking up road kill for the family cookout.'

Other family members shown include her chalk-miner father, Sugar Bear, and three sisters: Lauryn, aka 'Pumpkin', 
12, Jessica, or 'Chubbs', 15, and pregnant 17-year-old Anna, known to the family as 'Chickadee'.

The clan are seen in the earlier trailer squishing their flabby bellies around in one particularly charming scene.

One of the girls is seen telling the camera: 'We're not red-necks... we all have our teeth, don't we?'

A snippet from her debut on Toddlers 
& Tiaras was also included, which includes Alana's now famous line, 
'A dollar makes me holler, Honey Boo Boo'.

A January episode of Toddlers & Tiaras saw June tell of how 
she created a 'Go Go Juice' mixture of Mountain Dew and Red Bull after 15 bags of Pixy Stix - tubes of powdered sugar often known as 'pageant 
crack' - failed 
to boost her daughter's energy.

Beauty pageant Insiders speculate that some mothers' 'special juice' blends may even contain alcohol.

June was filmed instructing Alana to take 'two big gulps' from an 
unlabelled bottle. Within seconds, the change was apparent and the 
pageant hopeful was seen rapidly swinging her arms over her head and 
spinning around on the floor, exclaiming: 'My go-go juice is kicking in 
right now!'

Describing how 
the drink made her feel, she said: 'Go-go juice makes me laughy, and 
play-ey, and makes me feel like I want to pull my mommy's hair.

But she is not entirely enthusiastic about the experience. She was seen telling the cameras: 'Beauty is so boring, I don't want to do it.'

June's enthusiasm is more than evident though. As her daughter takes
 to the stage, she was filmed yelling encouragement and instructing 
dance moves.

When she is not
 accompanying her daughter on the pageant circuit, June says she spends 
her time collecting money-saving coupons and stockpiling hundreds of 
household products - a pursuit her daughter claims she wants to follow.
