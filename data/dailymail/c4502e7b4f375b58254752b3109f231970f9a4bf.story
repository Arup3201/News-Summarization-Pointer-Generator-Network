A gang who stole Audis worth £200,000 to strip for parts have been jailed after their sophisticated car cutting den was raided by police.

Akhtar Zamir, Khuram Razaq and Nakash Javaid took four cars in five days from homes in Birmingham, Coventry and Solihull in the West Midlands.

The men were able to steal security data from on-board computers using a key-copying device and programming the information onto blank keys.

Nakash Javaid (left) and Carlos Hemmings (right), both 26, admitted conspiracy to handle stolen goods and given a 25 month and 24 month prison sentence when they appeared at Birmingham Crown Court on Tuesday

Car cutters Wayne Williams, 32, (left) and Thomas Winkett, 26, (right) both from Brierley Hill, West Midlands,  were jailed for 20 months each. The pair dismantled the cars at an industrial unit in Lye and fled in a taxi

They were helped by accomplice mechanics Thomas Winkett and Wayne Williams who dismantled the cars at an industrial unit in Lye.

But undercover police followed them to the unit where Zamir, Razaq and Javaid were arrested on October 4, 2013.

Officers stopped Williams and Winkett in a nearby taxi after they tried to flee, while later that day associates Carlos Hemmings and Adam Leek were intercepted whilst travelling north on the M6 in a van crammed with panels from one of the stolen Audis.

The gang was jailed for a combined total of 17 years after they appeared at Birmingham Crown Court on Tuesday, September 16.

The court heard unit owner Javaid ran a car wash and part-worn tyre business as a front to the crooked enterprise

They had piled a wall of tyres high against the entrance to the cutting workshop to conceal it from the public.

The gang stole two Audi R5s, an A5 and A4 from outside homes in West Midlands in the space of five days. Pictured are the cars in the cutting workshop in Lye where the parts were stripped by accomplice mechanics

They used a key-copying device to steal security data from on-board computers before they were stripped

In the early hours of September 26, 2014 they stole an Audi A4 from Cheylesmore and three days later drove off in an A5 parked at a house in Edgbaston.

Later the same evening Razaq sent a text message to Zamir saying ‘fne me [phone me] found a present’ referring to an RS5 he had spotted on a driveway in Willenhall, which was stolen in the early hours of September 30.

And at 1.40am on October 1, CCTV captured members of the gang snatching another RS5 from The Village Hotel in Solihull.

Sergeant Glenn Marriott, in charge of Operation Transmission, a West Midlands Police taskforce set up to target ‘key-less’ car thefts, said: ‘Members of the group toured residential streets on the look-out for top-end Audis and, having identified a target, would return in the early hours to steal them using a key-programming gadget.

‘It was a sophisticated set-up and the group worked quickly to strip down the stolen cars and move on the parts.

The court heard the gang toured the streets looking for top-end cars and returned in early hours to steal them

Hemmings and Leek were intercepted on the M6 in a van crammed with panels from one of the stolen Audis

‘In fact, body panels recovered from the van on the M6 were from an RS5 stolen in Coventry just 14 hours earlier.

‘Police intelligence and covert enquiries identified the Lye unit as being pivotal to the operation and when we raided it we caught them red-handed with the car parts and diagnostic equipment for programming blank keys.’

He added: ‘Operation Transmission has enjoyed huge success in the 18 months since it was set-up.

‘During that time we’ve arrested more than 160 car theft suspects and recovered around £2.5-million worth of stolen vehicles.’

Zamir, 25, and Razaq, 23, both from Sparkbrook, Birmingham, admitted conspiracy to steal cars and were jailed for four years eight months and three years six months respectively.

Javaid and Hemmings, 26, both from Sparkhill, Birmingham, admitted conspiracy to handle stolen goods and were jailed for 25 months and 24 months respectively.

Car cutters Williams, 32, and Winkett, 26, both from Brierley Hill, West Midlands, admitted the same handling conspiracy charge and were jailed for 20 months each.

Leek, 31, from Yardley, Birmingham, admitted handling stolen goods and was given a suspended 12-month jail sentence and ordered to carry out 200 hours’ unpaid work.
