Celtic were on Friday standing by skipper Scott Brown after images of him slumped on the pavement and apparently drunk on a night out in Edinburgh emerged just days before Sunday's League Cup final.

The pictures, published in a tabloid newspaper, were taken after the Scotland captain had allegedly spent Wednesday night drinking with friends in lap-dancing bars in the capital.

Brown was also shown eating fast food in the photographs, flying in the face of manager Ronny Deila’s instructions to his players to be ‘24-hour athletes’.

Celtic refused to comment on the reports but Sportsmail understands the Parkhead club are playing down the seriousness of the incident after Deila gave his squad Thursday off. 

Brown, who has made 42 appearances for his country and is just eight caps away from entering the SFA’s hall of Fame, returned to training on Friday ahead of Sunday’s clash with Dundee United at Hampden. 

The Scottish Sun reported that Brown was in the Burke and Hare nightclub where he enjoyed the attention of scantily-clad girls and offered to buy dances for fellow drinkers.

But he was reported to have had an argument with some of the dancers and a barman had to intervene to calm the situation. 

Brown then left for the Western Bar where he was refused entry but was successful in getting into the nearby Baby Dolls lap-dancing bar.

The Sun reports that Brown was told by a bouncer to 'get some food and sober up' and he went on to fall asleep during a dance.

A source from Baby Dolls told the Sun: 'Brown and his pals weren’t in long. They had a couple of dances then left with no trouble, although they both clearly had a good drink in them.

'Scott was a bit wobbly on his feet.' 

Brown was a £4.4million signing from Hibernian in 2007 – the largest fee between two Scottish clubs.
