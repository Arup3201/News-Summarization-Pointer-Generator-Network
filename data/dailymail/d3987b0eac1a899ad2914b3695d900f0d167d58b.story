Eric Trump has married his partner of six years Lara Yunaska in a luxurious celebration in Palm Beach.

The 30-year-old son of billionaire businessman Donald Trump and his new wife, a former personal trainer held their nuptials at the Trump-owned Mar-a-Lago club in Florida.

Only two weeks ago Lara broke both her wrists in a riding accident and despite hopes they would heal in time, her bandaged arms were on display in the photos her guests posted to Instagram throughout the celebrations.

The couple invited over 400 family and friends, including Donald and his third wife Melania Trump, mom Ivana, and sister Ivanka Trump, who was a bridesmaid along with her daughter Arabella, who was a flower girl (pictured) 

The 31-year-old CBS producer walked down the aisle in a strapless Vera Wang dress with a ruffle skirt and a train.

She had her long hair in gentle waves, with a veil pinned at the back which she accessorized with large drop earrings.

When the newlyweds walked down the aisle, Lara tucked her arm between her husband's and held a soft pink rose bouquet so her bandages were not visible.

 Her new husband wore a black suit complete and a white shirt, complete with a white bow tie.

Lara's beloved pet dog Charlie was the ring bearer, while the groom's brother Donald Trump, Jr. was the best man.

Ivanka's husband Jared Kushner  presided over the nuptials, which took place under a crystal chuppah.

For the reception the bride changed into another Vera Wang creation featuring a drop-waist corset.

Lara's gorgeous look was captured in photos snapped by Eliza Murphy, an ABC reporter who attended the wedding. 

A source told the New York Daily News that the bride had instructed her team to find a way to make her bandages blend with her Vera Wang gown.

'It's in the hands of her wedding planner, Jennifer Zabinski, and event designer, Preston Bailey,' an insider told Confidential.

'I'm thinking they're going to make her some gloves or something to cover them up,' added the source.

'She's like, "I'm just going to embrace it,"' said the source.

'I think they're going to try and do something fun with the casts. She's been really cool about the whole thing.'

Last week, Lara's future father-in-law Donald Trump told MailOnline that the wedding would go ahead as planned, despite the bride-to-be's injuries.

'Her fingers are exposed. So the ring is good,' he said. 'It's too bad. But she's really strong, and they dig each other, so that's important.'

After announcing their engagement last July, the 30-year-old son of Donald Trump and his girlfriend, picked the Mar-a-Lago club which is where thirty-five-year-old Donald, Jr., the oldest Trump child, also chose for his wedding to model Vanessa Haydon in 2006.

The married couple, who have been together for six years, began their wedding festivities with a wine tasting at the Trump Winery on Friday, followed by today's the black-tie ceremony, with a brunch on Sunday.

Eric, who is the youngest of Donald's children with his first wife Ivana, proposed to Lara in July at the Trump Seven Springs estate in Bedford, New York.

It was reported that the couple had been on a walk with their miniature beagle, Charlie, when Eric presented his girlfriend with a dazzling ring from his sister Ivanka's fine jewelry collection.

They then celebrated with champagne, which Eric, EVP of development and acquisitions at his father's company, had brought along for the occasion.

When asked by OK! magazine about what they were most looking forward to on the big day, Yunaska laughed, 'Probably being done with wedding planning!

'We're looking very much forward to our honeymoon. We're going to go to Africa and then we're going to go to France.'

According to Page Six, the couple's wedding website jokingly describes Eric as 'born into a relatively unknown New York family... Eric embraced his family's passion for Erector sets, Monopoly and Jenga, which ultimately led to a very successful career in construction and real estate.'

The description continues: 'Bored with world domination, however, Eric soon realized that success isn't all it's cracked up to be without someone to love by your side.

The section describing Lara, who was once a personal trainer and now works as a journalist for CBS news program Inside Edition, reportedly refers to her as a 'Southern girl . . . breaking news guru and baker extraordinaire.

Lara, a native of Wilmington, North Carolina, certainly looks the Trump wife part, with her blonde hair, washboard abs and permanent tan.

After graduating from North Carolina State University, she attended the French Culinary Institute where she obtained a degree in Pastry Arts.

She and Eric live together in New York City, where they regularly spend time with Eric's older sister Ivanka, her husband Jared Kushner and their two young children Arabella and Joseph.

The couple were married at Donald Trump's swanky Mar-a-Lago club.

The 62,000 square-foot club, which was built in the 1920s by Post cereal heiress Marjorie Merriwether Post, is incredibly opulent and seated on a premiere piece of land in Palm Beach, Florida.

According to the club's website, the Six-Star Diamond Award-holding club sits on 20 acres of manicured lawns and has 126 rooms.

It was deemed a National Historic Landmark in 1972, a year before the heiress' death.

Members are lavished with services from formal and casual dining to salons, spas, and a two-acre private beach.

Its design mimics the Mediterranean villa style with elements of Moorish, Venetian, and Spanish influences.

Mrs Post used two different architects – one to design the inside and the other to oversee the outside.

Upon her death in 1973, she willed it to the U.S. government for use as a winter White House.

But the U.S. government said it was too rich for their tastes, citing the annual $1million maintenance costs as the reason for declining, according to the Palm Beach Post.

It was also too close to the Palm Beach airport.

It was purchased by the Donald in 1985 for $10million.

Mr Trump later renovated the mansion, adding a 20,000 square-foot ballroom, tennis and croquet courts, spa, and beach club.

In 2012 bargain hunters looking to join what is arguably one of the country's most exclusive clubs were told the $200,000 initiation fee had bee slashed to $100,000 for membership privileges.

The name Mar-a-Lago is Spanish for Sea-to-Lake
