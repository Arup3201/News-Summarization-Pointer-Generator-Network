UK flight searches to Brazil are up a whopping 697 per cent compared to 2013, according to new travel data.

Travel search engine KAYAK, which processes more than one billion queries for information annually, says Brazil should not only prepare itself for the football but for the hordes of English fans descending.

More England fans are looking into flights than the Germans, Spanish, French and Italians researched.

England fans also top the table when it comes to securing the best prices, paying 9.3 per cent less than their German foes.

By comparison, Italian fans have shown a lack of faith in their team’s potential performance at the World Cup, with flights increasing a comparatively small 147 per cent year-on-year.

England fans also come out on top in terms of securing the best deals on flights and hotels, paying on average £630.67 to jet out, whereas the German fans are forking out an average of £70 more.

Comparing hotel costs in Brazil’s five main cities, KAYAK calculated fans will have to pay the most in Rio de Janerio, where prices average at £236 per night.

But England fans planning to watch the match against Costa Rica on June 24 will be pleased to learn Belo Horizonte has the cheapest hotels averaging £195 per night.

Annie Wilson UK Managing Director of KAYAK said: ‘The World Cup competition starts hotting up well before the matches start.

‘KAKAK has seen a huge spike in flight searches, and the dream of reliving 1966 is clearly still alive as English fans have caused a far bigger increase than supporters in rival countries.

‘Our football fans will be cheering on the team in Brazil and even if we don’t come home with the trophy they can take pride in getting one up on our German adversaries when it comes to bagging the best flight prices.’
