Time behind bars, bailed out on bond and news of his upcoming knighthood was all part of the Papua New Guinea Police Commissioner’s weekend.In an ironic twist, the magistrate - Gibbs Salika, who sentenced Commissioner Tom Kulunga on Friday - also received a knighthood as part of the 2014 Queen's birthday honours list.Mr Kulunga was sentenced to seven months prison after the national court found him guilty on three contempt charges for failing to follow through on an earlier court order to reinstate a sacked policeman.

Jailed, bailed and knighted all in one weekend for Papua New Guinea's Police Commissioner Tom Kulunga

The day after Mr Kulunga was released on bail for $A4128, it was announced that the commissioner would receive a Knight Bachelor for services to policing, while Justice Salika would become a Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire for services to the judiciary.Despite his legal dramas, the PNG's governor-general’s secretary Tipo Vuatha said Mr Kulunga's knighthood will remain after his case reaches appeal.‘According to the chairman [of the honours committee], we cannot do much,’ Mr Vuatha said. ‘His case is still pending because of the appeal, so therefore what has been given will stand until the case is heard again.’

In making his judgement on Friday, Justice Salika noted Mr Kulunga's 40 years of service to PNG policing, but said he had no choice but to reinstate the sacked officer pursuant to the original 2012 court order.

A knighthood ceremony is expected in Port Moresby in October.

PNG Prime Minister Peter O'Neill is expected to front police in relation to allegations he authorised the illegal payment of about $31 million to a law firm

Proving a particularly colourful weekend, the country’s Prime Minister Peter O'Neill is expected to front the fraud squad on Monday after a warrant was issued for his arrest by the anti-corruption watchdog.

The warrant relates to allegations Mr O'Neill personally authorised the illegal payment of about $31 million to law firm Paul Paraka lawyers.

Mr O'Neill has strenuously denied the allegations, and said a letter produced by the opposition, allegedly bearing his signature and ordering the payments, was a fraud.

PNG's Opposition first raised the allegations last year, when Opposition Leader Belden Namah produced a letter allegedly bearing Mr O'Neill's signature and authorising the payments.

In January, Task Force Sweep announced Mr O'Neill had no case to answer following interviews with staff at the Prime Minister's Office, as well as checks of their outgoing correspondence register.

'We have searched all possible avenues including the PM's Office, Department of Finance, Department of Treasury and banks for the original copy of the subject letter without any success,'Mr Koim said at the time.

Also in January, the Opposition produced three National Court warrants for Mr O'Neill's arrest over the affair, however the government successfully had them overturned.

The Paul Paraka affair - called Parakagate in Port Moresby - is one of PNG's longest running fraud investigations.

Mr Paraka, one of the most powerful lawyers in PNG, was arrested and charged in 2013 for allegedly receiving the state monies which the task force alleges the payments were spread over a seven-year period and ran into the 'hundreds of millions'.

In May last year, Mr O'Neill threatened to sack everyone in his finance department over the alleged scam involving top officials and lawyers.

Mr O'Neill commands a huge majority in PNG's single house of parliament, with roughly 95 out of 111 ministers supporting his government.
