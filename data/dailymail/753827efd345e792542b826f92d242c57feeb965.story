A man who allegedly tried to break into Buckingham Palace carrying a knife has been charged, Scotland Yard has revealed.

David Belmar, 44, was arrested after he attempted to enter the Queen's London home at around 11.30am.

Tonight he was charged with trespass on a protected site and possession of a bladed article, will appear in court on Tuesday.

Officers chased the suspect as he ran through the palace's north gate, which is open for vehicles, and dragged him to the ground. When he was searched they found a weapon.

Relief: Queen Elizabeth, pictured last week, was not at home today when they security alert happened, Palace officials said

Buckingham Palace officials said that the Queen was not in the building when Belmar, from Haringey in North London, tried to get in.

'The man was searched and found to be in possession of a knife, which was seized,' a Met spokesman said.

Held: Victor Miller, 37, who was arrested for allegedly breaking in to Buckingham Palace last month

'He
was arrested on suspicion of trespassing on a protected site and
possession of an offensive weapon'.

Belmar is now in custody at a London police station awaiting trial at West London Magistrate's Court on Tuesday.

There were no injuries.

It came just a month after a suspected burglar was arrested after being discovered in a royal state room at Buckingham Palace.

DJ Victor Miller, 37, was found 'in an area currently open to the public during the day' after scaling a 12ft fence to get into the palace.

Miller, from Bow, East London, was arrested for burglary, trespass and criminal damage and was held in a mental health unit for 28 days for assessment.

The following day Prince Andrew reacted with fury at gun-wielding officers who mistook him for an intruder at Buckingham Palace and asked him to 'verify his identity'.

Two heavily-armed policemen confronted him as he walked in broad daylight through the grounds.

The fifth-in-line to the throne stood his ground asking the officers 'Don't you know who I am?' and was said to have ‘made his thoughts plain’ during the highly charged confrontation that followed.

A royal source said: ‘He was incredibly, incredibly angry. It was very much a case of guns being pointed at him and “halt who goes there”.’

Police issued a humiliating apology to the Duke of York over the extraordinary error.

Breach: In 1982 Michael Fagan evaded guards and walked into the Queen's bedroom, where he chatted to her for 10 minutes

Today's break-in attempt at Buckingham Palace is the latest in a series of security scares involving the Royal Family.

Famously in 1982 Michael Fagan 
evaded guards to get inside the Queen's private chambers while she was 
still in bed.

The 
unemployed father of four, then 31, spent around 10 minutes talking to the 
Queen after he climbed over the palace walls and up a drainpipe.

The
Queen managed to raise the alarm when Fagan asked for a cigarette, 
allowing her to call for a footman who held him until police arrived.

In March 2011 a car carrying the Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall (below) was mobbed by demonstrators who had split from a protest against higher university tuition fees.

Camilla
was visibly distressed after being poked in the ribs with a stick 
through an open window in the distinctive Rolls-Royce Phantom VI as she 
and Charles travelled to the Royal Variety Performance at the London 
Palladium.

In 2003, comedian Aaron Barschak managed to get into Prince William's 21st birthday party at Windsor Castle.

The
self-styled 'comedy-terrorist' set off a series of alarms and was 
caught on CCTV before he joined 300 guests at the bash and was removed.

In 1994, student David Kang charged at Charles while firing a starting pistol during a ceremony in Sydney, Australia.

Kang
was wrestled to the ground by New South Wales premier John Fahey and 
another man, while Charles was praised for his calm reaction.

In 1981, six blank shots were fired from the crowd while the Queen rode during the Trooping the Colour ceremony.

The Queen's horse was startled but she managed to bring it back under control while police rushed to grab the shooter.

In 1974, Princess Anne was the target of an apparent kidnap attempt in The Mall near Buckingham Palace.

Four
people, including her bodyguard, Jim Beaton, were injured after shots 
were fired when their car was forced to halt by another vehicle which 
blocked their route.

A police officer chased the driver, Ian Ball, and brought him to the ground before arresting him.
