The father and brother of heroic Queensland flood victim Jordan Rice have lost their house and are now living in a homeless shelter to survive, despite $456 million being donated to a Federal appeal for flood victims. 

John Tyson, 49, lost his wife Donna Rice, and his son Jordan, in the 2011 Queensland floods which devastated the region.

The floods affected 70 towns and over 200,000 Australians. 35 people died in the crisis, including Donna and 13-year-old Jordan, who was hailed worldwide for his selfless act of bravery in the moments before his death.

John's youngest son Blake, then 10, Jordan, and their mother Donna were trapped on the roof of their family's Mercedes Benz in the middle of floodwater when a passerby attempted the rescue the trio.

Despite Jordan not knowing how to swim, he told them to rescue Blake first, seconds before being swept away with his mother by the raging current. 

The grief and anguish John Tyson experienced from the loss of his wife and son has been compounded by a series of events where he and son Blake have found themselves homeless.

'We just got to the point where we had no money. We slept in the car for week,' John told Daily Mail Australia.

'I asked myself, is this it? Is this what I'm destined to do?' 

John and Blake, have been living at the Blair Athol Uniting Church's crisis accommodation centre on the Gold Coast for the past 12 weeks.

The community housing is a long way from their hometown of Toowoomba, where John owned two profitable businesses.  

'When the floods happened a lot of people wanted to help me, and I mean a lot of people, worldwide,' John said.

'Instead of taking the money I chose to direct everything to the Premier's flood fund, which was what I believed was fair because there was a lot of other people suffering, not just me.

'I never wanted to be put above anyone else.' 

A now iconic image of Blake with rescuers in the aftermath of the floods went viral, and media outlets around the world published photos of Jordan, recognising his remarkable act of love and courage. 

'It wasn’t me that promoted Jordan all over the world, it was politicians. I just thought I wanted people to be looked after fairly, which was my whole intent, and as a result over $450 million was raised with the flood fund.'

John has been campaigning to have his son awarded the Cross of Valour posthumously, a move which was encouraged by Prime Minister Tony Abbott in the aftermath of the floods. 

His financial trouble's began when  he was approached by Queensland Police to aid a revamp. Desperate to improve the emergency response system which John believes failed his wife and son, he threw all of his energy, and money, into the project.

John and several close friends pooled together over $500,000 of their personal savings, which was then poured into the creation of an innovative safety website and app. 

'The police and associated personnel publicly encouraged me in the mainstream media, saying that I would be involved in a revamping of 000 system. They dangled a carrot if you will, knowing that I'm very passionate about this.'

John alleges that the Royal Commission inquiry into the death of his wife and son discovered significant negligence, which he believes resulted in their death.

'There was a major shortfall in emergency services, which came out a year after their deaths,' John said.

'Less than eight minutes before they died there was a police car 20 meters away, six untasked firetrucks less than 100 meters away, and a police car that knocked off ten minutes early. They all neglected to help.'

The passionate father channeled his grief into the revamp project, 'knowing that I could never heal until I was able to help prevent what happened to me from happening to others.'

John invested all of his finances into the project, which involved the development of an app which synced with emergency services to link people in trouble to those nearby who could help.

'I don’t want people to feel sorry for me, but to say to themselves that if it can happen to him, it could happen to me,' said John

The project developed over four years, only for John to be told last month that the project was unsuitable and should be taken to Neighbourhood Watch.

'They paid me lip service for the past 4 years, and it wasn’t until last month they told me my ideas needed to be taken elsewhere. 000 is privately owned, and not many people know that.'

'Politcians encouraged me, I got letters from ministers saying ‘how wonderful’. They all just turned to nothing, and the oucome was 'thanks for coming, we’re done, we never had intention of implementing it.'

Not only had John poured all his savings into the project, he and his family never received any of the $450 million which was donated towards helping victims of the flood.

'A lot of people seem to think I got all this money, but I didn't get a thing.'

'I've learned there is a lot of money in misery,' John said, 'and I hope I can instigate some change in that area.' 

Despite explicit promises that the money would not be spent on infrastructure and would go towards helping flood victims return to normal life, a large portion of the money was spent on building projects.

'$80 million was allocated to building the River Walk in Queensland, and a hefty lump of $100 million was spent in the Toowoomba range, but it wasn’t for flood mitigating projects. It went on road works,' said John. 

'There was a major shortfall in emergency services, which came out a year after their deaths,' John said

'Less than eight minutes before they died there was a police car 20 meters away, six untasked firetrucks less than 100 meters away, and a police car that knocked off ten minutes early. They all neglected to help,' John said

With no more money and unable to find help, John searched frantically to provide a stable home for his son and was put in contact with the crisis accommodation center he now lives in.

'The center is home for now until I can formulate a way forward, and focus on how to get there from here.' 

The devoted father-of-three has been left feeling betrayed and confused, unable to move forward from the tragedy which took his wife and young son from him.  

'Everything I've ever done has been built on honesty and trust. I've never doubted my ability to put good initiatives into place,' John said,

'Emotionally, it's very draining. My way forward is helping, I just want to help, but I can't, so I'm unable to take even a step forward. I cant heal. These are the things that really get to me.'

'I don’t want people to feel sorry for me, but to say to themselves that if it can happen to him, it could happen to me.'

For now, John and Blake, who John described as 'a very quiet and private boy', will remain in the crisis center until they can financially support themselves.

Despite his living situation John is determined to continue to help others.

'I really feel that I should be allowed to help, to work on aiding people and lessening the impact of natural disaster and preventing loss of life,' he said. 

'I try and that’s all you can do. If I come up short at least I tried.'
