There will come a point on Sunday when those on The Kop will look out and see a dream from bygone days has become reality.

Steven Gerrard will take possession from Xabi Alonso and look up to see Fernando Torres, Luis Suarez and Thierry Henry spinning off defenders, desperate for his pass. How potent would Liverpool have been had those five men lined up in their prime?

Unique circumstances will allow fantasy to become reality for 90 minutes but it will be Liverpool the city, rather than the team, that feels the benefit as Anfield stages an All-Star match that has created enormous interest, for many reasons.

How will Torres be received four years after his £50million move to Stamford Bridge? What kind of reception will Chelsea captain John Terry be afforded? How much will Suarez’s return stir the locals’ senses of what they have been missing?

Gerrard will captain his side against a team selected by his friend and former vice-captain Jamie Carragher and the proceeds from the match, which sold out in hours, will go to a number of charities in Liverpool, as well as Alder Hey Children’s Hospital.

The idea came about after Gerrard approached Liverpool and raised the prospect of staging a match to say “thank you” to the club and the city before he embarks on a new challenge with LA Galaxy.

Xabi Alonso has also confirmed that he will be a part of the novelty all-star game for friend Gerrard

‘It's going to be a great occasion,’ Gerrard said. ‘When I made the calls and told the players they would play in front of a full house at Anfield, they loved the idea. Jamie and I shouldn’t get any credit: it's credit to everyone who wants to come and help out.

‘I know all those who are involved. They are winners and it will be a great game. John Terry could easily have said “no” but it shows the type of guy he is.’

Carragher added: ‘When I spoke to Thierry Henry, he was more excited than I was! It will be great for some of the former players who left Liverpool to have the chance to come back and say a proper goodbye.’
