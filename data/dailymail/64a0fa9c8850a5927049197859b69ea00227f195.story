President Barack Obama has become the 'Typhoid Mary' of congressional politics, a Republican political operative told MailOnline on Wednesday, with Democratic senators terrified to be seen with him as they fight to keep their jobs in November.

Obama delivered a fiery State of the Union speech Tuesday night that was more about style than substance, drawing jeers for avoiding mention of the scandals that have plagued his administration since his last speech to a joint session of Congress.

The president raised eyebrows and Republicans' hackles before the address by threatening to go around Congress to implement his agenda, but proceeded to present a laundry list of desires that require collaboration with Capitol Hill.

The president launched a campaign-style 
swing Wednesday morning to sell elements of his speech, but the five states he will visit do not include any where 
Democratic senators are in tight re-election contests.

Sen.
 Mark Udall of Colorado, a Democrat struggling to avoid being swept out 
of office, dodged questions from CNN afterward about whether or not he 
would welcome a presidential visit in his state.

'Is he a liability for you – the president – back home?' CNN's Dana Bash asked him in an interview after the president's State of the Union address. Udall bobbed and weaved.

'Does that mean you're going to campaign with him?' Bash demanded.

'That was not a yes or no,' Bash pressed after another lukewarm reply.

Udall wouldn't answer.

'We'll see what the president's schedule is, we'll see what my schedule is' he said. 'But Coloradans are going to re-elect me based on my record, not the president's record.'

A GOP campaign pollster in Udall's home state of Colorado told MailOnline that the senator has good reason to avoid the topic.

'The president is officially the Typhoid Mary of Senate politics,' the longtime Denver operative said, while asking not to be named. 'If he comes to Colorado to campaign with Udall, they're both going to get clobbered.'

Toxic: Obama, at the Costco bakery today, will visit Wisconsin on Thursday to speak at a General Electric plant in Waukesha. The Democratic mayor will not be there. Neither will Mary Burke, the Democrat running to unseat Gov. Scott Walker in November

America Rising, a GOP-aligned super PAC, produced a graphic on Wednesday showing the states Obama is visiting this week and next. The picture is one of the White House carefully avoiding places where America's increasing skepticism of his leadership might hurt Democratic senators.

'Democrats in competitive elections are going to have to freshen up their excuse Rolodex this fall if President Obama is headed their direction,' explained America Rising executive director Tim Miller, a former deputy communications director at the Republican National Committee.

'But pretending to be otherwise engaged is not going to save these Democrats from the leader of their party's sinking approval ratings in November.'

Obama's political radioactivity is also giving down-ticket candidates something to worry about.

He will visit Wisconsin on Thursday to speak at a General Electric plant in Waukesha. The Democratic mayor will not be there.

Neither will Mary Burke, the Democrat running to unseat Gov. Scott Walker in November.

She 'has a full day scheduled in western Wisconsin Thursday and will not be able to join the president during his visit to Wisconsin,' her spokesman, Joe Zepecki, said Tuesday.

Republicans in the state can hardly conceal their glee.

'It's no surprise that millionaire Mary Burke is hiding from President Obama,' Wisconsin state GOP executive director Joe Fadness retorted in a statement.

He described President Obama as 'her party's unpopular leader and the architect of a disastrous health care law and policies that have resulted in record debt and a sluggish national economy.'

Nationally, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid tried Tuesday night on CNN to stop the bleeding, insisting that Democratic incumbents will ultimately embrace Obama.

'Barack Obama is personally a very popular guy. And people love this man. They love his family," Reid said.

The president 'is a good person to campaign for anybody,' he insisted. 'The president understands government. But he also understands politics. And that's why he won two elections overwhelmingly,'

But Democratic senators Kay Hagan of North Carolina and Mary Landrieu of Louisiana made headlines recently when they failed to turn up at presidential events in their states. 

Tuesday's State of the Union seemed more tailored to building Obama's legacy than helping Democrats get elected, making it even less likely that Democratic senators will welcome him with open arms in the fall

Alaska Sen. Mark Begich, another 
Democrat fighting for political survival, said last night that he would 
welcome an Obama visit to America's northern frontier – but only so he 
could show Obama how wrong his energy policies are, specifically 
regarding drilling for oil and gas in the Alaska National Wildlife 
Refuge.

'When I ran and won was the same year he ran for his first election for the presidency, he lost Alaska by 22 points and I still won my election,' Begich boasted.

'If he wants to come up, I’m not really interested in campaigning. What I’d like him to do is see why his policies are wrong on ANWR, for example,' he said. 'He opposes oil and gas development. I’d like to show him why it’s the right move to move that forward, to create jobs in oil and gas.'

Senate Democrats need to hold on to their majority in order to prevent Republicans from controlling the entire Congress during President Obama's last two years in office. They are defending 21 seats in November, compared with just 15 for Republicans.

Five of those are in red states – Alaska, Arkansas, Montana, South Dakota, and West Virginia – where Gallup notes Obama averaged just 35-percent support last year.

That reality has created scenarios where vulnerable Democrats are shunning a politically toxic Obama, whose potent scandals have tainted his Departments of State, Justice, Treasury and Health and Human Services.

Since 2004 just 4 out of 49 incumbent senators have won re-election when their party's sitting president was less popular in their home states than he was nationally, notes National Journal.

'Senate Democrats have a big problem,' the inside-the-beltway newspaper concludes. 'President Obama is very, very unpopular in the states Democrats have to defend in the 2014 elections.'
