E-book readers 'free' fans from having to show off what they're reading - and it seems many users like to go for rather racy fare.

Around a third of e-book users read erotic novels on their devices, confident that others can't see them.

In a poll of 1,863 people conducted in Britain this week, 34% admitted to having read erotic novels on the devices.

Another 57% said that they used their e-reader to hide the fact that they were reading children’s books, such as Harry Potter, whilst 26% said they used theirs to disguise their sci-fi books habit.

Overall, 58% of people admit to using their device to 'hide' what they are reading, according to the poll by MyVoucherCodes.co.uk.

Mark Pearson, Chairman of MyVoucherCodes.co.uk, said ‘Having an e-reader does make it a lot easier to disguise what you’re reading, but it was quite an eye-opener to find out how many people use the fact that they have an e-reader to read an adult novel or two!’

An earlier poll of British readers found that a third of ebook readers are too embarrassed to reveal the truth about what they are reading.

One in five said they would be so ashamed of their collection that if they were to lose their ebook reader they would not claim it back.

But the results also showed that 71 per cent of books on the shelves of those who responded were autobiographies, political memoirs, and other non-fiction titles - but those categories accounted for just 14 per cent of e-books read by those surveyed. 

The most popular e-books were thrillers and mysteries followed by romance, humour and fantasy.

Fifty-five per cent said they had read fewer than a third of the books on their shelves while one in 10 admitted they had never read any of them.'
