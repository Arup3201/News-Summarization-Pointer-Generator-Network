When looking for a thrill or a rush of excitement, people do things like take spontaneous cross-country road trips, go bungee jumping, or, if their really brave, go skydiving.

But for renowned skier and BASE Jumper Erik Roner, excitement is nothing less than being airlifted in a lawn chair by 90 balloons and shooting his way down with a shot gun.

Yes, you read that correctly.

Stunt: Renowned skier, BASE jumper, and Nitro Circus member Erik Roner's last stunt involved a lawn chair, 90 balloons, a parachute and a shotgun

Ascend: Roner attached 90 balloons to a lawn chair and ascended 8,000 feet into the air 

Peace: Once he reaches 8,000 feet, Roner says, 'Wow. It really doesn't get much more peaceful than this'

In his latest trick, the Nitro Circus member used 50 tanks of helium to inflate 90 balloons, according to The Daily Dot. 

Roner enlisted the help of a bunch of friends who helped him attach the balloons to a lawn chair using a bungee chord -- but not without losing a few balloons along the way.

In a video of the stunt, Roner ascends 8000 feet into the air in the lawn chair with a shotgun in tow. 

There are cameras attached to his clothing and to the chair as his friends film from below. 

'Wow. It really doesn't get much more peaceful than this,' Roner said when he reached 8,000 feet.

He began shooting the balloons with the shotgun until he began to descend.

He then detached the chair from the cluster of balloons and began skydiving with the shotgun in his hand. 

He soon deployed his parachute and floated safely to the ground, his trick successful.

Shotgun: Roner uses his shotgun to shoot and pop some of the balloons in an effort to descend back down

'Later:' When he descends enough, Roner detaches the lawn chair from the balloons and says 'later' before sliding out of the lawn chair

Safely: Shotgun in hand, Roner parachutes back down to earth safely
