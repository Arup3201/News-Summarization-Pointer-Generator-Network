Americans were out in force celebrating St. Patrick's Day across the country today but judging by the pictures some had already enjoyed the Guinness a little too much.

Events are being held across the U.S. and the globe today and tomorrow to mark the March 17 festival.

Chicago held it's annual parade this morning and dyed the Chicago River green while New York held its famous parade greeted by thousands.

Revelers, children and even pets were decked out in green to mark the occasion with Irish flags hanging from street corners across the country.

At the New York parade which claims be the 'oldest, biggest, and best in the world', partygoers withstood the snow and cold to join in the fun.

The massive parade, which predates the United States beginning in the 1700, was led by 750 members of the New York Army National Guard.

The parade lasted for almost five hours with dancers, bands and battalions all taking part. The 1st Battalion of the 69th Infantry has been marching in the parade since 1851.

Michael Bloomberg took in his last 
St. Patrick's Day as mayor, waving to a cheering crowd.

Marching
just behind him was Irish Prime Minister Enda Kenny, who presented 
Bloomberg with a historic Irish teapot earlier in the day.

'The
Irish are found in every borough, every corner of New York,' Kenny said. 'In previous generations they came heartbroken 
and hungry, in search of new life, new hope; today they come in search 
of opportunity to work in finance, fashion, film.'

Luck of the Irish: NYPD Officer Vierling proposed to his girlfriend earlier today on the New York parade and she said yes

An NYPD officer, Jon Vierling, used the opportunity to ask his girlfriend Kelly Collins to marry him during the celebrations and she said yes. 

He was marching with fellow officers when he used the opportunity to break off for the proposal.

'I thought he was working today which is why he couldn't come,' Collins said.

'We're crazy, the Irish, we're funny 
and we talk to everyone,' said 23-year-old Lauren Dawson, of Paramus, 
N.J., who came to her first St. Patrick's Day parade.

Some had, however, enjoyed the craziness too much and pictures began emerging of handfuls of people a little worse for wear in the city this afternoon. 

In
the south of the country, thousands of revelers garbed in green
crammed the oak-shaded squares and sidewalks of downtown Savannah, 
Georgia, for a celebration that's a 189-year-old tradition.

Led by bagpipers in green kilts, a parade kicked off Saturday morning, hours after customers began lining up at downtown bars.

More than 1,000 worshipers also packed 
the pews of the Cathedral of St. John the Baptist for the Mass that 
traditionally precedes the parade.

Bev Kehayes, of Greensboro, North Carolina, joined friends near the 
start of the parade route. She made hats with green feathers and flowers
just for the occasion.

'It's good, clean fun. Heaven forbid there's a little alcohol involved,'
said Kehayes, who says she's missed only three of the celebrations in 
Savannah in 29 years.

Boston was also getting into the mood ahead of its parade tomorrow.

The
112th St. Patrick's Day parade is expected to be attended by nearly 1 
million people but pub crawls will be going on all weekend.

At the Boston Beer Garden, bartender Tilmar Cassiano told USA Today he was expecting things to be busier that normal.

'People
start drinking early in the day and they are here all day and all 
night. It's going to be on a Sunday so that means the crowd will be even
bigger.'

In Maine, St. Patrick's Day prompted 
Gov. Paul LePage to relent on a vow to veto any bill that reached his 
desk before lawmakers pass his proposal to pay a state debt to 
hospitals.

He signed a measure Friday allowing bars to serve alcohol a 
few hours earlier than usual, starting at 6 a.m., on the Sunday holiday.

About
1,500 miles southwest, the city of Houma, Louisiana., was holding its 
unconventional celebration - an Irish-Italian parade, with a celebration
that features both Irish cabbage and Italian sausage - on Sunday.

The 
event resumed last year after a 10-year hiatus.

In
Rolla, Missouri, the Missouri University of Science and Technology 
continued a St. Patrick's Day tradition that began in 1908, when students paid homage to the patron saint of Ireland who was the patron saint of 
engineers.

In Ireland, Dublin's five-day St. 
Patrick's Day festival was unfolding with a new addition.

For the first 
time, up to 8,000 visitors from around the world were due to march in a 
so-called people's parade on Sunday, when Ireland's capital city also 
intends hold its usual procession of bands and pageantry.
