This is the heartwarming moment a woman risks her life crossing a busy motorway to rescue a dog which has been it by a car and become trapped by the central reservation.

Motorist Vero Salgado had seen the animal get hit by a car as it tried to get from the crash barrier back to the safety of the hard shoulder and open ground.

The gripping video, filmed by her friend, 
captures the Good Samaritan negotiating thundering traffic along the 
four-lane highway to try and reach the dog.

'It only looked like a glancing blow but
 the poor animal had cowered down on the ground and was paralysed with 
fear,' said Salgado, 35.

'I decided to cross over the road to see if I could rescue it but it was difficult because traffic was thundering past always in one lane or the other all the time. And nobody wanted to stop or even slow down for me or for the dog.

'To say I wasn't scared would be a lie, I was terrified and my heart was beating faster than I could have thought possible.'

The drama unfolded on the hard shoulder of the highway
 between Mexico City and Pachuca, near the city of Ecatepec., with traffic speeding past on the main artery.

Salgado's
 friend captured the heart-stopping moment she dashed across the 
motorway to try and reach the dog and her desperate attempts to gain its
 trust so she can lead it to safety.

The nervy dog - clearly terrified - is seen moving away every time its rescuer tries to get near.

'I needed 
to be patient, I tried slowly to coax him and eventually I managed to 
get to him and put my belt around his neck as a lead,' said Salgado.

'The
 next thing I was worried about was in case he tried to run forward into
 the traffic as I knew I wouldn't be able to hold him, but it all went 
well and I was able to seize the moment and cross back over to safety.'

Finally, the woman is seen lifting the dog up and managing to cross the busy motorway with it in her arms before loading it into the car to take for medical attention.
