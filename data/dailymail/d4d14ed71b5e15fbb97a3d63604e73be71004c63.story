Chelsea will be forced to pay over £30million to lure Inter Milan striker Mauro Icardi to Stamford Bridge if they follow up their interest in the prolific Argentine.

That's according to Inter's sporting director Piero Ausilio, who claims the Italian club would not sell the 22-year-old if they received a big money bid this summer.

Premier League leaders Chelsea and Manchester United have both watched the former Sampdoria man, who has 14 goals in 24 Serie A games.

Sporting director Piero Ausilio insists Inter would reject bids of £30million for their star striker Icardi

'What if someone bids €40m (£30m) for him in the summer?,' Ausilio told Sky Sport. 'Well we've got no intention of doing business, we're thinking of the present and future of this football club with Icardi.

'Our intentions are clear. We're building a team to last for a long time with very talented, young players.

'As well as Mateo Kovacic and Icardi, we've added more quality players such as Marcelo Brozovic and Xherdan Shaqiri and we want to continue in this vein.'

Ausilio claims that Icardi is on the verge of signing a new contract at Inter, the club he joined back in 2013

Ausilio also confirmed that Icardi is close to signing a new contract at the San Siro, giving the club more power when it comes to keeping him out of the clutches of Premier League clubs.

Ausilio added: 'I was with his (Icardi's) agent until a few minutes ago, we're coming close to an agreement. Icardi will remain with us for much longer.

'Tomorrow (Tuesday) we will have another meeting, during which will a draft contract will be signed, before official deal, that will happen very soon.'
