A rare Hermès tote sold at auction yesterday to an anonymous bidder for $185,000, the second-highest price ever paid for a Birkin bag.

The Himalayan Nilo Crocodile Birkin - encrusted with 245 diamonds, boasting 18-karat white gold hardware and crafted from extremely pale crocodile skin - sent bidders into a frenzy via phone, online and in person at Heritage Auctions in Beverly Hills, Los Angeles.

Managing Director of the auction house, Kathleen Guzman told CBS MoneyWatch: 'Hermès raises crocodiles on its own farm, breeding them to have very light coloring. 'But then to search for a crocodile that has almost an albino skin is extraordinarily rare.'

Eye-watering: This rare Hermès Himalayan Nilo Crocodile Birkin (pictured) sold at auction yesterday to an anonymous bidder for $185,000, the second-highest price ever paid for a Birkin bag

According to Ms Guzman, it probably took a Hermès designer 'a full year' to craft the bag, and mentioned that if it should become scratched or damaged, the company vows to repair the flaws 'immediately.'

Given its eye-watering price, however, it seems unlikely that this bag will ever grace the arm of its mystery owner. 

'Hermès is the only line of bags that can sell on the secondary market for more than their retail price,' Ms Guzman said, adding that as a result, these bags tend to be traded purely as investments. 

The Himalayan Nilo Crocodile Birkin sold for $35,000 more than its estimated value of $150,000, making it only second in price to a diamond-encrusted Birkin which sold in 2011 for $203,150.

Handbags of this high caliber are produced in tiny batches and reserved only for a 'select number' of elite Hermès clients. 

Even a standard Birkin comes with a waiting list and a $10,000 starting price tag. According to Ms Guzman, if you walked into any Hermès store in the world and asked for one off the shelf, 'they would look at you like you had two heads.'

Victoria Beckham is famously fond of the Hermès design, reportedly owning a collection worth over $2 million, while Kim Kardashian has so many that she uses one as a gym bag.

Ironically, the woman the Birkin bag was originally inspired by and named after - actress Jane Birkin -  doesn't even like them. The British star has famously denounced them as 'bloody heavy' - and said the one she owns hurts her arm.

The Birkin came into existence following a chance meeting on an airplane between Ms Birkin and Hermès chief executive Jean-Louis Dumas in 1981.

Mr Dumas watched as Ms Birkin struggled to get her straw bag into the overhead compartment - and when she finally did, the contents fell back to the floor.

Ms Birkin, who is best known for her film roles in the 1960s and for being the partner of French singer Serge Gainsborough, explained she couldn't find a decent weekend bag.

In response, Mr Dumas modified an existing design and in 1984, the Birkin Bag was launched. It was an instant hit with fashionistas around the world - but Ms Birkin herself was less than impressed.

In an interview in 2012 Birkin grumbled: 'What's the use of having a second one? You only need one and that busts your arm - they're bloody heavy.

'I'm going to have to have an operation for tendinitis in the shoulder.'
