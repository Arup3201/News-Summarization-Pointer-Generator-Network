Bollards installed at the entrance to a picturesque Oxfordshire village that boasts David Cameron as its MP has enraged residents who say they look more in keeping with a council estate.

The 'ghastly' bollards were put up in Asthall, West Oxfordshire, two months ago to prevent the bridge collapsing in the village.

But villagers were taken aback by the unsightly bollards, which stuck out in the area of natural beauty. 

Villagers in the West Oxfordshire village of Asthall are enraged by the decision to install unsightly bollards

Local say they have to squeeze their cars through the tight gap and there is a danger of it scratching

The historic and picturesque village of Asthall is home to Patricia Janet, Baroness Scotland of Asthal, former Attorney General 

Dominic Wood, owner of the Maytime Inn, told MailOnline the erection of the bollards had impacted on his business.

'You can't even get a decent sized car through without the risk of scratching the wheels. It looks ghastly and is the sort of thing you see on a council estate rather than in the countryside', he said.

'They have over-narrowed the road so much that if you are driving anything wider than a Morris Minor it could get scratched.

'I think it looks horrible, I don't understand why the council did it.'

He added: 'As well as the closure of the main walking bridge across the village, it has been a massive issue for my business.' 

Gill Hill, clerk of Asthall Parish Council, said the installation of the gate and bollards was a 'bit extreme'. 

She said: 'It does seem rather unattractive in an area of natural beauty. 

'It is supposed to only be a temporary measure, but it does seem a bit extreme. We have always endeavored to keep the village looking rural but this looks awful and it is difficult to get through.'

Farmer Edward Walker, who has lived in the village since 1969, told MailOnline the village bus had got stuck trying to force its way through the narrow gates and vans were struggling to get in to the village. 

MailOnline has tried to contact West Oxfordshire District Council for a response.  

Villagers say the bollards was out of keeping with the natural beauty of the Cotswold village

Asthall is a village and civil parish  about 6 miles  west of Witney. It includes the hamlets of Asthall Leigh, Field Assarts, Stonelands, Worsham and part of Fordwells.

For a small village, it is rich in history. It has a former Roman settlement on Akeman Street, which linked Cirencester with St Albans and the village church dates back to the 12th century.

Asthall Manor, an Elizabethan manor house, was home to the six Mitford sisters, who were the reality stars of their day. 

They were known for their beauty, their 'breeding', their title and their vast country estate. 

It was also in the manor house that Nancy Mitford penned much of 'Love in a Cold Climate' that was first published in 1949. 

Today, it still boasts well-known public figures. Patricia Janet, The Baroness Scotland of Asthal and former Attorney-General for England and Wales, is a resident.
