Eunice Williams was sent home wearing only a nightie and a thin dressing gown in sub-zero termperatures

An 86-year pneumonia patient was sent home from hospital in sub-zero temperatures wearing just her nightdress and a thin dressing gown.

The family of Eunice Williams were furious to discover the state she was in, especially as they had supplied plenty of warm clothing.

They have now received an unreserved apology from Wrexham Maelor Hospital after they complained.

Mrs Williams, who lives near Llangollen, north east Wales, had been admitted with pneumonia a week earlier and her family was terrified the journey in the cold could make her worse.

Yesterday they said she was deteriorating.

Her nephew Paul Douglas, 32, said: 'I made sure she had plenty of winter clothes to wear because it had been so cold but these were ignored and she was sent home in night clothes with the warm things in a bag.She was close to getting hyperthermia.

'It's disgraceful an 86-year-old woman who has just been treated for pneumonia should be treated in this way. She could have died.'

The family were told Mrs Williams would be discharged and taken home by ambulance so Mr Douglas, of Wrexham, and his mother, Mary, went to prepare the house and greet her. But they could not believe the state she was in when she arrived.

Wrexham Maelor Hospital has since apologised for the incident

They did, however, commend the treatment Mrs Williams received while in hospital.

Betsi Cadwaladr University Health Board has since apologised unreservedly for the error.

A spokesman said: 'We can confirm the family have contacted the hospital to express their concerns about this incident.

'It has been investigated and we have spoken to both Mrs Williams and the family to express our sincere apologies that we did not ensure Mrs Williams was changed into appropriate clothing before her journey home.

'We have already spoken to the relevant nursing staff and reminded them of the importance of making sure patients are correctly dressed, taking due account of the weather.

'A formal meeting has been arranged to review the incident and to ensure all involved are clear this event was not acceptable and should not occur again.'
