In custody: Former prime minister of the Turks and Caicos islands Michael Misick has been arrested in Brazil after fleeing the country with an alleged fortune of $180million

The former jet-setting premier of the Turks and Caicos islands has been arrested in Brazil on an international warrant.

Michael Misick fled the British overseas territory in 2009 after a report exposed widespread corruption.

The former prime minister is alleged to have amassed a personal fortune of $180m and lived a lavish lifestyle.Â 

He was detained  by Brazil's federal police in Rio de Janeiro as he was about to board a plane for Sao Paulo yesterday and will now be extradited back to the Caribbean islands to stand trial.

Britain was forced to step in and suspend the constitution and take over administration of the Turks and Caicos islands in 2007.

Misick is suspected pf corruption, misusing public money and profiting from the sale of government land to developers.

The island's tourism industry saw a boom in resort-building during his time in office.

Misick, who was first elected in 2003, has always strenuously denied any wrongdoing.

Brazil's federal police said in a statement that agents 'have been investigating his whereabouts for more than a year'.

It is understood he had been living in Rio de Janeiro for a number of months and frequently some of the city's most exclusive neighbourhoods such as Ipanema and Leblon.

He had papers to work in the country and had apparently tried to claim the right to asylum - but had his application rejected last month.

Misick has complained that the charges against him are politically motivated and he is being persecuted by Britain.

There was mixed reaction to his arrest in the Turks and Caicos islands.

Some
 celebrated the news while others lamented it, accusing Britain of 
running a smear campaign against Misick and his Progressive National 
Party.

Party
 members called an emergency meeting Friday afternoon to talk about the 
arrest, which comes nearly a month after the territory held 
parliamentary elections for the first time in three years, ending 
Britain's direct rule.

Britain no longer rules the Turks and Caicos islands after fresh elections were held last month.
