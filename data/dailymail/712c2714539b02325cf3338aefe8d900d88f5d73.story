President Obama has called the fatal shooting of unarmed Missouri teen Michael Brown 'heartbreaking', in a statement issued on Tuesday afternoon.

The president, who is currently vacationing on Martha's Vineyard, Massachusetts, offered his 'deepest condolences' to the family of the 18-year-old who was shot up to eight times by a police officer, who witnesses claim then fired on Brown as he lay wounded on the street.

The message from the president was followed by one from Brown's mother, Lesley McSpadden, who was asked if she had a message to the policeman who shot her son.

She said: 'If he did something wrong, you know you did something wrong. You take your punishment. If you were a man you'd stand up, you'd be a man, you would say you was wrong.'

The days since the incident, which unfolded in broad daylight on Saturday, have been marked by riots and looting by Brown's incensed supporters who have clashed with heavily-armed police on the streets of suburban St. Louis.

'The death of Michael Brown is heartbreaking, and Michelle and I send our deepest condolences to his family and his community at this very difficult time,' said the president in his statement on the teens controversial death.

'I know the events of the past few days have prompted strong passions, but as details unfold, I urge everyone in Ferguson, Missouri, and across the country, to remember this young man through reflection and understanding,' the President said in the statement.

 Brown, 18, was shot dead on Saturday night in St Louis by a cop after 
witnesses said he walked towards them with his hands in the air

'We should comfort each other and talk with one another in a way that heals, not in a way that wounds. Along with our prayers, that’s what Michael and his family, and our broader American community, deserve.'

Seeking to diffuse tensions in the community, the president said that in addition to the FBI, Attorney General Eric Holder and the Department of Justice have begun investigations into Brown's death.

The president's statement on the tragic shooting follows Ferguson Police Chief Tom Jackson backtracking on his promise to name the officer who shot Brown - claiming he would be putting the man's life in danger if he did.

According to witnesses, the officer is apparently white and opened fire on Brown while his hands were raised.

The decision by Jackson to renege on his vow to name the officer by 2pm on Tuesday was met with heavy criticism by Brown's father, Michael Brown Sr.

'This person's got to pay for this,' said Brown Sr.

'If the name of the victim is released, how is the name of the perpetrator not released? We cannot in good conscience ask for toxicology tests of Mr. Brown without asking for it of the officer,' said Jamal Bryant, a pastor who appeared at a press conference with the Browns, their attorney Benjamin Crump, and the Reverend Al Sharpton today according to ABC News.

Ferguson
 Police Chief Tom Jackson said on Tuesday that he would not be releasing
 the name of the police officer involved in the shooting of Michael 
Brown. He said he hoped to at a later date when tensions had eased

Jackson said he decided not to name the officer after another of his staff was falsely named as the shooter.

'We've been getting death threats as a result to that officer. Officer safety is why we are not releasing the name (of the officer who shot Brown.)

'It's too volatile and dangerous. We think that the value of releasing his name is far outweighed by the safety at this point.'

However, as Ferguson, St. Louis, faces another tense night, Michael Brown's parents urged the community and and civil rights leaders to appeal for calm and to cease rioting.

'I just want justice for my son. I really do. I need justice for my son,' said Michael Brown, Sr. to ABC News.

'I understand everybody has their own pains because they have losses too, but I need everyone to come together and do this the right way so we can get something done about this. No violence, man.'

The town of Ferguson has been on edge since Michael Brown, 18, and another teenager were confronted by an officer Saturday near Brown's apartment.

Police say one of the teens shoved the officer back into his car and a struggle ensued. Brown was struck by several bullets after emerging from the car.

Eyewitnesses have said Brown was raising his hands in surrender and that the officer kept firing. Authorities had said they would release the officer's name Tuesday but later decided not to, citing death threats against the officer.

The FBI and St. Louis County police are conducting separate investigations.

The shooting sparked two nights of unrest. Looting broke out late Sunday at dozens of stores in Ferguson and neighboring communities.

On Monday night, police used tear gas and fired 'bean bag' rounds after a crowd turned rowdy, throwing rocks and bottles at officers. No serious injuries were reported.
