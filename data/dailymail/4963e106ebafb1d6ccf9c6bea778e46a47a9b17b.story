Chelsea fear they will be without Cesc Fabregas for at least two more games.

Fabregas injured his hamstring during the Capital One Cup semi-final against Liverpool last week and missed Saturday’s draw against Manchester City.

He is unlikely to be fit to return in time to face Aston Villa on Saturday and is struggling to make the game against Everton at Stamford Bridge on Wednesday.

And top-scorer Diego Costa will serve out the final games of his three-match ban against Villa and Everton after being found guilty of violent conduct by stamping on Liverpool’s Emre Can.

At least the enforced lay-offs give the two star players time to rest ahead of Paris St Germain.

As Chelsea are out of the FA Cup, Mourinho’s squad will have five clear days after the Everton game before they take on the French champions in Paris, in the first leg of the Champions League last 16.

John Obi Mikel has also been out since suffering a head injury against Bradford in the FA Cup, and the lack of midfield options will only increase the chance that Juan Cuadrado making an instant debut. 

The Colombian international completed his £27million transfer from Fiorentina on Monday and trained with his new teammates yesterday. 

He is capable of playing in a number of midfield roles. Cuadrado is most likely to be deployed wide on the right where his energy will give Mourinho to flexibility to move Ramires or Oscar into the Fabregas role alongside Nemanja Matic.

Chelsea go to Villa hoping to end a patchy run of form — winning only four of the last nine games and one of those in extra time.

Chelsea defender Branislav Ivanovic said: ‘We are now in the second part of the season and this is the part where each game is very important in deciding where we will be.

‘We have to think about going one more step forward, one more game forward.’
