A children's playground at a smart new housing development has been sealed off for months - because it is too brightly coloured.

The play area was a major attraction to families who paid up to £500,000 for properties on the Corinium Via estate in the Cotswolds.

But when it was completed last summer, a handful of locals complained that the size and colour scheme of the playground were not 'in keeping' with the upmarket area.

Developer Redrow Homes erected a metal fence around the site and vowed to repaint the swings and climbing frames, which are primarily red, green, blue and yellow.

But the area has remained sealed off ever since - and Redrow is now seeking planning permission to change the colour scheme and relocate some of the equipment.

Elizabeth Lloyd, 33, who lives opposite the park, said her four-year-old daughter and two-year-old son are desperate to play on the equipment.

She said: 'People have complained that it was too brightly coloured and not in keeping with the local colour scheme.

'Redrow offered to take it away and paint it dark green. Then people started complaining it was too big and that it could distract drivers going past.

'It's ridiculous, the only people complaining are people who don't have children.

'My husband and I bought our house specifically because it was going to overlook the park, but I'm sick of staring at an iron fence.'

Shelleigh Bailey, 39, who lives nearby, said she blames snobbery in the affluent area.

She said: 'Someone's complained about it being too bright.  I would understand it if it was some cheap metal play park, but it's actually very nice.

'I think it's not seen as "Cotswolds" enough. It's a shame for the kids because they have waited a long time to play on it.'

The Redrow homes on the Corinium Via estate, at Kingshill on the edge of Cirencester, Gloucestershire, were completed in August last year.

Families living on the estate say their children are 'miserable' looking at the fenced-off play area

The developer, Redrow, says it is waiting for planning permission to repaint and move some of the equipment

Many of the properties are finished in traditional Cotswold stone in keeping with the local landscape.

Redrow set aside half an acre for a play area, which would be built once construction was nearing completion on the rest of the site.

The park contains slides, swings, rockers, monkey bars, a climbing frame and a cargo net.

But before it could even open, some locals complained that it was too big, too bright and too visible to passing traffic on the main road.

The developer agreed to repaint the equipment dark green and left the construction barriers in place - where they still remain today.

Elizabeth Lloyd, who moved into a four-bedroomed £450,000 house with her husband Bruce in December 2011, said she would now rather have the park removed completely.

She said: 'The people who are complaining about it don't have children.

'My kids have sat and looked at this for the best part of a year. It's pretty miserable.

'We need parks and spaces for children. At the end of the day it's a park and we all bought homes knowing it would be built.'

Redrow Homes has now applied for planning permission to change the colour and move some of the play equipment.

But Gavin Hill, Technical Director for Redrow Homes, denied that the area is bigger than permitted.

He said: 'Due to concerns raised by some residents over the new playground's colour scheme at the opening has been delayed.

'In response to the complaints, Redrow has agreed with residents and Cotswold District Council to adjust the colour of the equipment and move a few play items further away from dwellings.

'Redrow has submitted new plans to Cotswold District Council which are expected to be approved by the end of next week.

'Once we receive approval the remedial work will commence and the play area opened without further delay.'

Cotswold District Council spokesman Bob McNally said: 'Cotswolds District Council has responded to objections that were brought to us by some residents whose homes are near or overlook the play area.

'At the request of several residents, it was agreed collectively that the opening of the play area would be put on hold until their concerns were considered further.

'One of the residents' concerns was about the bright colours of the equipment - which are not in line with the approved plan conditions for the play area.

'The developer has agreed to address this as soon as the formal planning approval for relocating the equipment is granted.'

Playground designer and manufacturer Andrew Lane said the issue of people without children complaining about playgrounds was a common one.

Mr Lane, who is operations director of Sutcliffe Play in Pontefract, said bright colours helped children who were visually impaired navigate themselves around playgrounds.

He said: 'Inclusivity should be designed into play areas to promote integration of able and less able children.  Frankly, this playground is one of the less colourful options, being predominantly timber construction.'

Mr Lane said a similar playground would cost around £25,000-£30,000 to build, and said it was 'not unusual to have residents who don't have children complaining about children enjoying themselves'.

He added: 'Sometimes they even invoke the Human Rights Act saying that the children's playground affects their right to peace and tranquility.'
