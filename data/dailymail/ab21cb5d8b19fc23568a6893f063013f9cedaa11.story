Animal rights campaigners in Russia are furious after a circus allegedly attached hamsters to balloons and dropped them down to children in the audience as 'live gifts'.

The rodents were apparently dead by the time they reached the crowd below, leaving the children in the audience 'acutely distressed'.

Some parents have complained the animals were placed inside bottles and thrown into the audience and, in some cases, rats were used instead of hamsters.

Siberian-based circus allegedly attaches hamsters to balloons and drops them down to audience members

Parents say their children were upset and distressed by the rodents, some of which are dead on arrival

The circus, based in the Siberian city of Krasnoyarsk, takes this controversial act all over Russia, according to the Siberian Times. 

34,000 animal lovers have so far signed a petition calling for them to stop using hamsters in such a way.

Olga McManaman, who organised the petition, said: 'I invite all animal lovers and caring people to protest against this outrageous practice of inhumane animal treatment.'

The animal rights campaigner from Siberia has urged people not to donate hamsters to the circus because they will be mistreated.

She is not the only one incensed by the act, which sees hamsters dropped from up high in the big-top circus tent.

Yevgenia, a mother, said: 'My child really did get a small dead hamster. I want to complain about this.

'My daughter experienced huge stress. She cried for hours.'

Another parent, Svetlana, said: 'It was just torture, throwing live hamsters straight into the crowd for kids to catch.

'Children pushed each other, someone stepped on a girl's hand and one hamster was crushed.'

A third mother from Smolensk said: 'They throw the hamsters from the top to the ground but also horizontally. 

'They put hamsters in some sort of bottles and throw them so that kids have to catch them. It looks awful.'

The performer responsible for the abuse has since been punished, according to the circus in question. 

Its art director, Yuriyi Karnaukhov, said: 'We sincerely apologise to all kids and their parents who were upset.' 

Campaigner Olga McManaman has attacked the circus. One mother said: 'It was just torture, throwing live hamsters straight into the crowd for kids to catch.

The circus art director has apologised to upset parents and children, and claims the performer responsible has since been punished

But animal rights organisations aren't convinced.

Viktor Donzhenko, head of Krasnoyarsk animal rights group Friend, said: 'It is a horrible case of abuse and I am very happy that so many people signed the petition.'

He says Russia does not currently have laws protecting animals who belong to individuals.

'The owner of the animal can treat it as he wants as it's his property,' he said.

'We have been fighting to pass a law that protects the animals owned by people from abuse.'

'I hope this case will help not only to stop the cruelty with which the animals are treated in this particular circus, but also speed up a new law which will stop such things in the future.'
