A judge on Friday imposed a 50-year sentence on a woman convicted of killing her husband using pliers, a box cutter and a plastic baseball bat during a jealous rage.

Justice E. Allen Hunter, who previously described 51-year-old Roxanne Jeskey's actions as 'monstrous savagery,' told her he chose not to impose a life sentence because of her brain injury.

Her lawyers argued that the injury contributed to mental problems, leading to the violent outburst in June 2011.

Roxanne Jeskey stands up after hearing her verdict of guilty by Superior Court Justice E. Allen Hunter in the murder of her husband Richard 'Rick' Jeskey in May

A medical examiner reported that Richard Jeskey was beaten and strangled and suffered cuts, punctures and bruises from head to toe. His naked body was found in a bathtub in their Bangor apartment.

Mr Jeskey suffered extensive multiple blunt and sharp force injuries to the head, neck, torso, limbs and genitalia, Ferenc said in the autopsy report.

He also was strangled with sufficient force to break the hyoid bone of his neck, Ferenc testified last year.

The hyoid bone is the bone at the top of the neck under the chin.

The judge concluded that the injuries were inflicted with a plastic baseball bat, razor, wooden and metal rods from broken towel racks, a pair of needle-nosed pliers, and, perhaps, other implements.

'Any one of these injuries standing alone manifests a depraved indifference to the value of human life,' Hunter said.

'Taken together, they reflect a monstrous savagery and cruelty that defies comprehension.'

Roxanne Jeskey looks toward family members as she is led into the courtroom at the Penobscot Judicial Center in Bangor on Monday for the start of her murder trial.

It is clear from Dr. Ferenc’s testimony that Richard Jeskey, while alive, was subjected to extreme cruelty that rises to the level of torture,' Assistant Attorney General Leane Zainea said.

From his head to his lower extremities, he was cut, sliced, punctured, beaten and burnt.

Most of the injuries he sustained were accompanied by hemorrhaging, which is indicative that his heart was beating and he was alive when he was beaten, repeatedly cut, sliced and punctured.

'This is not, if there is such a thing, a ‘run of the mill’ murder,' she continued.

'It is a murder characterized by, in the words of the definition of depraved indifference, such outrageous, revolting, savage, brutal or shocking conduct that it readily demonstrates an almost total lack of concern or appreciation for the value of human life on the part of the defendant. It is a murder involving literal torture.'

'Ms. Jeskey had injuries on her body that, in combination with her mental health issues, could represent the trigger to an unreasonable reaction and show of force against Mr. Jeskey' Defence attorney David Bate wrote.

'Admittedly, the court found that the severity of Mr. Jeskey’s injuries and duration of time it would take to inflict those injuries indicates sufficient intent or knowledge to support a conviction.

'However, the severity of the injuries also represents an extreme and unexpected departure from 48 years of no criminal activity, strongly suggesting that her mental health status played a substantial role in what unfolded that night,' he concluded.

Guilty: An emotional Roxanne Jeskey, 51, of Bangor apologized to her husband¿s family and said just before being sentenced that she regrets her actions the night of June 12 to 13, 2011

A neighbor testified that Roxanne Jeskey was angry because her husband had been calling another woman.

Experts gave conflicting testimony at Jeskey’s trial about whether she knew right from wrong the night she killed her husband.

Prosecution and defense experts testified that Jeskey’s cognitive skills and memory are impaired because of the removal of the tumor. However, she was found competent to stand trial

On Friday, she addressed the judge and suggested she would have been better off letting "nature take its course" instead of having surgery 10 years earlier to remove a brain tumor.

Jeskey also apologized to her husband's family. .I can honestly say I've prayed for you. I do feel your sorrow. I do miss him. He was my husband,' she said.

Later, she looked at her own family and said, 'God will make each day better than the day before, and I'm confident I'll get the help I need.'.

Prosecutors sought a life sentence for Jeskey. The defense asked the judge to impose 20 to 25 years, and said she'd likely die in prison even with that sentence.
