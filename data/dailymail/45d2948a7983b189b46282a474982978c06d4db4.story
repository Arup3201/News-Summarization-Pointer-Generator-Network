A billionaire's wife raided his safe while he was playing golf to find out what he was worth, a court heard yesterday.

She never had full access to her secretive husband’s vast wealth and he only gave her ‘an allowance’, it was said.

When their relationship broke down and divorce loomed, she opened his safe in search of documents about his finances, the High Court was told.

Admission: A judge at the High Court heard that a woman 'illegitimately' looked in her husband's safe while he played golf to gain financial information ahead of their divorce

Yesterday a judge condemned her actions and branded her guilty of a ‘serious breach of candour’.

The names of the couple, who have a 26-year-old son, were kept secret on the orders of the judge.

But they were described as a family 
who ‘enjoyed all the trappings of vast wealth, an international 
lifestyle with property in different countries, antique furniture, fine 
art, fully staffed households, private jets, boats and yachts’.

Their 27-year marriage began to break
 down after the wife began an affair, according to the husband, 52. He 
then had an affair of his own – and, in 2009, a son with his mistress.

The wife, 57, said she believed her 
husband could be worth many hundreds of millions of pounds. She said he 
had been ‘described in the Press as a “billionaire”,’ and he had 
threatened to ‘disappear’, with her getting ‘nothing’, if she divorced 
him.

In February this year, she won a court order freezing £20million of assets belonging to her husband.
Among other things, it prevented him from selling their luxury villa in 
Marbella, Spain, bought in 1990 for £800,000 but now worth £10million. 
But Mr Justice Mostyn said the freezing order was ‘flawed’ because the 
wife had neglected to mention that she had broken into her husband’s 
safe when she applied for it.

Ruling: Mr Justice Mostyn QC said the wife had 'seriously breached her duty of candour' by accessing her husband's safe

She had been collecting documents for
 ten years, but claimed they had been ‘left lying around’ or had been 
‘ripped up and placed in the rubbish bin’. She said she had also 
occasionally removed paperwork from his briefcase and a filing cabinet.

But the judge said that was ‘not the whole truth’ and the woman had admitted raiding her husband’s safe.

‘On the occasion in question, [my 
husband] was out playing golf,’ the woman had said. ‘He always kept the 
key to the safe in his bag. I went into the office, removed the key and 
opened the safe.

Given his secrecy about financial 
issues, I wished to obtain as much information as possible as I 
suspected that we would divorce at some stage.’

Mr Justice Mostyn said: ‘The failure 
by the wife to state in her affidavit in support of her freezing 
application that some of the documents derived from her accessing the 
husband’s safe was a serious breach of her duty of candour.’

In refusing to renew the ‘draconian’ 
freezing order, the judge said it was fatally flawed, with the figure of
 £20million just ‘plucked out of the air’.

He said freezing orders ‘usually poisoned’ such cases, leaving husbands ‘enraged’ and relationships remaining ‘forever soured’.

The husband is suing his wife for 
damages for breach of confidence and misuse of private information. The 
case will be heard first, before divorce proceedings, next January.
