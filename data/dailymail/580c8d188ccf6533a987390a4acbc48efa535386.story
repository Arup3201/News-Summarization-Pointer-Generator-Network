Angela Merkel last night insisted she wanted Greece to stay in the euro amid rumours that Germany was planning a ‘temporary’ exit for the country.

The German Chancellor sought to reassure Greek prime minister Antonis Samaras over the country’s future in the single currency as it lurches closer to the abyss.

But at crisis talks in Berlin she refused to give Greece more time to tackle its ballooning debts.

cuts

Speculative reports on the internet 
claimed the German finance minister Wolfgang Schaeuble was drawing up 
plans for Greece to leave temporarily while it straightens out its 
finances.

However, there is thought to be 
strong opposition among key European officials in Brussels and Frankfurt
and it is unlikely any such move would happen this year.

Analysts in London dismissed the rumours.

A spokesman for City firm Monument 
Securities said: ‘A temporary exit is the stuff of fantasy because a 
temporary exit will expose the same chain reaction links that an 
outright exit would, with the same painful consequences for all.’

Mr Samaras, who meets French 
President Francois Hollande in Paris today, is desperate to secure 
‘breathing space’ for Greece to get its finances under control.

In the German and French media this 
week, Mr Samaras has been arguing that his country should have more time
beyond the mid-2014 deadline to complete reforms that are a condition 
of it continuing to receive bailout loans.

Without the help, Greece would be forced into a chaotic default on its debts and could be forced out of the eurozone.

But Mrs Merkel said: ‘We will not 
make premature judgments but will await reliable evidence’ – meaning the
report by international inspectors into the country’s finances due this
autumn.

She added: ‘Greece is part of the eurozone and I want Greece to remain part of the eurozone.’

Leading German politicians have voiced deep skepticism about granting Greece any concessions.

Merkel and French President Francois Hollande, meeting a day before Samaras came to Berlin, put the onus squarely on Greece to fulfill its pledges.

Athens has faltered in the speed and effectiveness of implementing the reforms - irritating creditors, notably Germany, which is the single largest contributor to its 240 billion euro ($300 billion) bailout packages.

Weeks of political wrangling in Greece that ultimately brought a coalition government under Samaras to power didn't help.

Greece's continued access to the bailout packages hinges on a favorable report next month from the so-called 'troika' of the country's debt inspectors - the European Union, European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund.

If Greece is found to have failed on key economic reforms that are conditions of the bailout loan, vital funds could be halted.
