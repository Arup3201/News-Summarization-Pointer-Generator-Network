Most people try to keep their bathrooms spotless - but one family decided to use theirs to raise a leopard cub.

Newly-born Nimbus was abandoned by her mother shortly after her birth at the Cotswold Wildlife Park in Oxfordshire.

Keeper Jamie Craig found her close to death along with another cub who sadly did not survive. He then decided to take her home and rear her by hand - using the family bathroom as her makeshift compound.

His delighted children, Jai, 13, and Niemi, 10, helped with the care and Nimbus, now two months old - and the animal is well enough to return to the wildlife park.

Mr Craig said: 'We found her abandoned in the leopard exhibit with another cub, who unfortunately didn't survive.

'Once we warmed her up and gave her some food it was actually surprising how strong she was.

Jamie Craig opted to keep Nimbus in the family's bathroom so the tiny animal could have 'free rein'. He added: 'It's also got a very easy floor to clean and obviously she had her own bed in there and everything'

It is hoped that Nimbus, pictured with Jamie Craig during one of her feeding sessions, will re-join other leopards at the park and eventually join their breeding program

'We decided the bathroom was the best place to bring her up because she could have free rein.

'It's also got a very easy floor to clean and obviously she had her own bed in there and everything. It just meant that we had to sacrifice our bathroom.

'We'd quite often get out of the shower to a rather sharp surprise. The children also had their toes nibbled whilst they were using the toilet quite a lot.'

Mr Craig said they kept a constant eye on the cub, to monitor any changes in her health.

The family had Nimbus at their house for six weeks. Mr Craig said: 'It's best to keep them at home because things can change so fast and it's good to be around just in case'

Mr Craig, pictured revealed that his young children 'would get the odd scratch' from the tiny leopard - but that 'she was very good with them and they were very good with her'

He added: 'It's best to keep them at home because things can change so fast and it's good to be around just in case.

'She's spent about six weeks in the house. At first I would be feeding her just whenever she was hungry.

Clouded leopards are found in the Himalayan foothills through mainland Southeast Asia and into China. 

In 2008, it was classified as 'Vulnerable' by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. Its total population size is suspected to be fewer than 10,000 mature individuals.

Adults weigh between 11.5 and 23 kg (25 and 51 lb) with females varying in head-to-body length of up to 94cm and a tail length of up to 82cm long.

They are often referred to as 'modern-day saber tooth' because of their long, piercing canine teeth. 

'Now I've managed to limit it to every four hours from 6am to 10pm, you have to limit it really for their health and your own sanity.

'The kids would get the odd scratch but in general she was very good with them and they were very good with her.

Mr Craig revealed that while it was sad to see Nimbus return to the Cotswold Wilflife Park, it was the right time for her to leave. She will gradually be introduced to other big cats

'You have to be careful now though, you forget how big their teeth and claws become, she was starting to show her animal instincts.'

The leopard has now been returned to Cotswold Wildlife Park where she will gradually be introduced to other big cats.

Mr Craig said that whilst it was sad to see her go, it was the right time for her to leave.

He said: 'It is a little bit sad to see her go but she left at the right time and now we can have our bathroom back. '
