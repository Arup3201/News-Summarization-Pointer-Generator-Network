In the week FIFA were hit with a potentially crippling law suit over football’s ‘negligent’ handling of head injuries, the world governing body have launched a mental-health research project.

The class action suit, filed last Wednesday by a group of parents and players in California, alleges football’s governing body have acted ‘carelessly’ and ‘recklessly’ in their management of head injuries — a move which could have far-reaching implications for the sport.

The filing reads: ‘FIFA presides over this [concussion] epidemic and is one of its primary causes.’

Injured: This summer’s World Cup in Brazil was blighted by cases where players carried on with the game

Succumbing: Germany’s Christoph Kramer was eventually taken off in the final but initially kept playing

This summer’s World Cup in Brazil was blighted by a spate of cases where players — including Germany’s Christoph Kramer in the final — were allowed to play on after suffering concussion. 

Last season’s Premier League also saw a number of alarming cases, one of which involved Tottenham goalkeeper Hugo Lloris, where medics were over-ruled by management desperate to return players to the field.

Earlier this month the FA’s head of medicine, Dr Ian Beasley, told the Mail on Sunday football could face a ‘tsunami’ of damaging legal claims if it fails to radically improve its protocols.

Beasley’s prediction appears to be coming true in the US. The so-called ‘soccer moms’ lawsuit is not seeking financial compensation but is looking for rule changes which allow for adequate time for off-field assessment while limiting the number of headers allowed by children under 17. 

Symptoms such as depression, increased aggression levels and increased risk of suicide have all been linked to repeated concussions, and FIFA’s investigation into mental health issues in football appears to be in response to the lawsuit.

Adamant: Tottenham goalkeeper Hugo Lloris overruled his medics and played on despite his injury

Dazed: Lloris is led off by medical staff but returned to the action soon after and did not want to go off

Back: Lloris, against his medical advisers' wishes, came back on the field after sustaining a head injury

‘Any scientific data on the mental health of athletes is rare, and almost no scientific study has yet investigated the mental health among football players,’ the statement read. ‘To respond to this gap in knowledge, FIFA has established the new research area, so that those in the game feel more comfortable coming forwards to talk about issues and in order to ease access to treatment.’

Last week a group of sports medics — including representatives from the NFL, FIFA, the International Rugby Board and Australian Rules Football — met in New York to discuss what some have termed a ‘concussion crisis’.

‘Fifa’s decision to start research into mental health issues in the same week as a law suit is filed may be coincidence,’ said one attendee.

‘There appears to be so little understanding of head injuries within the organisation they may not even have realised the link.’
