With wheelbarrows, a lawn mower and an abundance of plants and shrubbery, it certainly ticks all the boxes for the average garden.

But with its huge collection of quirky ornaments and life-size scarecrows, which fill the 40ft by 30ft space to the brim, this front lawn gives landscape gardening  a whole new meaning.

The award-winning oasis, which is nestled in the heart of Caol - the largest village in Scotland - is the result of eight years of hard work by 64-year-old grandfather Robert Rae.

Grandfather Robert Rae, 64, has spent the last eight years transforming the front garden of his council house in Caol, which is the largest village in Scotland

The keen gardener and grandfather-of-six took up the hobby after being forced to give up work as a telephone box cleaner following a heart attack about eight years ago

After plenty of hard work and graft, his front lawn now has more than 1,000 ornaments including a year-round Santa, Snow White and Seven Dwarfs and a scarecrows

Mr Rae said many of the ornaments and features of the incredible garden have been bought for him as gifts by his four children and six grandchildren

He has spent much of the last decade transforming the garden of his council house as part of a project to keep him busy after being forced to give up work as a telephone box cleaner following a heart attack.

Mr Rae initially took up gardening to pass the time and help with his recuperation but it soon turned into a full-time hobby.

His first addition to his front lawn was a stone garden ornament of a motorbike with a rider. He later added a few more bits and pieces and it wasn't long before his four children and six grandchildren also started buying goods to add to his collection.

The garden is now choc-a-block and Mr Rae said there's so many different ornaments that he's lost count of how many different features he has in it.

'It's probably around a thousand but I can't be sure. It could be more than that,' he said. 

From mannequins complete with sunglasses and wigs, to figurines, ornaments, dolls and gnomes, the garden features everything imaginable. 

As well as a year-round Santa on display and the children's favourite of a Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, it also has boasts a white ornamental tiger, life-size ornamental cats and dogs and replicas of every type of farmyard animal you can imagine.

The 40ft by 30ft space is full to the brim of quirky ornaments  and gives landscape gardening a whole new meaning. He now attracts visitors from around the country

Mr Rae has even been forced to install CCTV cameras to keep watch over his garden after vandals broke in one night and damaged some his hard work

The 64-year-old initially took up gardening as a hobby to pass the time and recuperate following his heart attack but it has now turned into a full-time job

He's even managed to fill it with a mini lighthouse, an old bike, an old wheelbarrow – which he retrieved from dump – an ancient pram complete with a doll of a baby, a few chimneys and a clutch of clocks.

Fairy lights have been strung up around the edge of the garden and solar lights and panels also help to add to the magical nighttime experience which sees it light up much of the estate.

All of the quirky ornaments sit on a lawn of artificial grass, but real goldfish and tadpoles can be found swimming around in his pond.

He's also got a riot of real flowers growing in pots and hanging baskets which are scattered throughout the garden.

He said: 'It gives me something to do. I never thought it would end up like this when I started but the village children enjoy it. There's still room for more.'

His wife Margaret added: 'He really loves his garden. I think it's what keeps him going. He says he does it for the kids but I'm not so sure.'

Mr Rae said of his passion: 'It gives me something to do. I never thought it would end up like this when I started but the children enjoy it. There's still room for more'

His wife Margaret said fondly: 'He really loves his garden. I think it's what keeps him going. He says he does it for the kids but I'm not so sure'

Mr Rae has won numerous competitions for his beloved garden over the last couple of years including Best Ornamental Garden in 2009 and Best Easy Care Garden

Visitors from all over the country flock to the council estate to see Mr Rae's garden, with many spending hours marveling at his creations and taking pictures of the site

His daughter Doreen, 42, has helped contribute ornaments to the garden - which has become an enjoyment for the whole family.

She said: 'Everywhere we go we bring him something back for the garden. Every anniversary, every birthday, every Christmas we buy something for him. 

'Everyone in the family does. It's really mounted up but dad thinks it' s great. He spends a lot of time and effort on it and he's very proud that "Caol In Bloom" have presented him with awards for the garden. 

'In 2009 he won Best Ornamental Garden, the following year he got Best Easy Care Garden and then in 2011, 2012 and 2013 he was commended. So he's done very well.'

While visitors initially flocked to the garden at Christmas to see it lit up like a fairyground with an abundance of festivities, tourists have now started to visit all-year round to marvel at his creation.

From teddy bears and lifesize ceramic dogs to baby dolls and homemade scarecrows, the front garden features a wide range of quirky and unusual items

Despite laying artificial grass on the lawn, Mr Rae has filled his pots and hanging baskets with real flowers which he tends to on a regular basis to ensure they stay fresh

However, the increased number of  visitors arriving to take pictures of the incredible site has also brought increased problems for Mr Rae.

The garden was recently vandalised in the middle of the night and the grandfather has now been forced to install a CCTV system to watch over his pride and joy.

He said: 'It was vandalised. The police advised me to get the surveillance cameras and we've had no more trouble'.

His wife added: 'Someone came in the night and moved nearly everything. It was all out down along the middle of the street. Can you imagine anyone going to all that trouble? We could hardly believe our eyes when we looked out in the morning.'
