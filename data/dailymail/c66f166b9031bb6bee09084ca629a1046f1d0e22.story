It is a post-Cold War collaboration between the US and Russia, which has provided heat to millions of homes across America.

But the little-known Megatons-to-Megawatts programme, which has seen 20,000 decommissioned Russian nuclear warheads transformed into nuclear energy in the US, has drawn to a close this month.

The final shipment of low enriched uranium (LEU) was unloaded at the Port of Baltimore in Maryland on December 10 after a four-week journey by sea from St Petersburg.

The little-known Megatons-to-Megawatts programme, has seen 20,000 decommissioned Russian nuclear warheads transformed into nuclear energy in the US, heating millions of homes

It was the last of the LEU converted from more than 500 tonnes of highly enriched uranium from the Russian warheads, deactivated under the 1991 START treaty at the end of the Cold War.

The recycling and transfer of the uranium to the US was formalised in a 1993 agreement and has seen hundreds of shipments arrive in the US destined for the country's nuclear reactors.

The programme has supplied nearly 10 per cent of all American electricity and around one in 10 light bulbs powered via the scheme in the last two decades.

The shipment marks the end of the unprecedented programme, which has seen the US pay its former enemy $8billion (Â£5bn) in the last 20 years.

The programme has supplied nearly 10 per cent of all American electricity and around one in 10 light bulbs have been powered via the scheme in the last two decades

The shipments are transported from St Petersburg to America by sea, before they are taken to the USEC Paducah plant to be converted into uranium pellets used to fuel nuclear reactors across America

The four cylinders of LEU was taken from
 Baltimore to the Paducah Gaseous Diffusion Plant in Kentucky, where it 
will be turned into uranium oxide pellets destined for nuclear power 
plants across the country.

Towards
 the end of the Cold War, Philip Sewell, a former deputy assistant 
secretary at the US Department of Energy, was given the task of seeking 
ways to collaborate with past enemies.

His quest saw him travel through the Russian countryside, to military facilities, many of which were not on the map.

Describing a typical scene, Mr Sewell said: 'Windows were broken, gates were not locked, and there were very few people around.'

But
 it was inside the crumbling, dilapidated buildings that the Russian 
government stored the uranium from thousands of decommissioned nuclear 
weapons.

Concerned that the
 material could so easily fall into the wrong hands, Mr Sewell and his 
colleagues decided the situation was so dangerous that they needed to 
negotiate with the Russians to persuade them to sell the surplus to the 
US.

Initially, the Russians refused.

'It
 was a matter of pride, principle and patriotism,' said Mr Sewell. 'Even
 though they didn't need that excess material, [and] they didn't have 
the money to protect it, they didn't want to let go of it.'

But the Russian nuclear industry needed funding and so the government yielded and a deal was struck in 1993.

The United States Enrichment Corporation (USEC), is the US government agent responsible for implementing the historic agreement.

Before
 the uranium was shipped to the US, the bomb-grade highly enriched 
uranium was converted and diluted into low enriched uranium.

'The Megatons to Megawatts Program made a
 substantial contribution both to the elimination of nuclear weapons 
material and to nuclear energy generation in the United States,' said US
 Energy Secretary Ernest Moniz.

'Nearly every commercial nuclear reactor in the United States received nuclear fuel under the programme.

'This Agreement serves as an example of what the United States and Russia can achieve when we work together, and we are carrying this success forward into other nonproliferation activities with each other and with our international partners.

'For two decades, one in ten light bulbs in America has been powered by nuclear material from Russian nuclear warheads.'

'The 1993 United States-Russian Federation Highly Enriched Uranium Purchase Agreement has proven to be one of the most successful nuclear nonproliferation partnerships ever undertaken,' Secretary Moniz added.

'The completion of this "swords to ploughshares" program represents a major victory both for the United States and Russia.'

National Security Council spokeswoman Caitlin Hayden, said in a statement: 'The United States and Russia are commemorating the completion of one of the most successful non-proliferation programs in our history.

'The United States and Russia remain strongly committed to building on this success, and will continue to collaborate across various fields of nonproliferation, nuclear security and nuclear research and development.'

The initiative has come to an end after Russia claimed the US was not paying enough for the uranium - which is roughly the equivalent value to 10 billion barrels of crude oil.

While the Megatons-to-Megawatts programme has ended, Russia will continue to supply uranium to the US.

A new 10-year programme is expected to supply around half the level of the previous scheme by 2015, with the option to increase it to the same level as the Megatons-to-Megawatts programme if both sides agree.

The difference is that, under the new contract, the supply will no longer come from decommissioned warheads, but from Russia's commercial activities.

The programme came to an end this month as the last shipment reached the US

The process began with the removal of the warheads and their highly enriched uranium metal components.

At
 plants in Seversk and Ozersk the components are ground down into metal 
shavings, which are then heated and converted into a highly enriched 
uranium oxide.

That was 
then heated to make a gas, which was mixed with a very low enriched 
uranium material before it was diluted to less than five per cent 
concentration the fissionable uranium-235 isotope, a level too low to be
 of any military value but ideal for producing electric power.

The
 material is then transferred to 2.5-tonne steel cylinders, enclosed in 
protective shipping containers and sent to a storage facility in St 
Petersburg.

After 
completing its journey to America, the shipment is then taken to the 
United States Enrichment Corporation (USEC) plant in Paducah, where it 
is tested to ensure it meets the appropriate specifications.

It
 is then converted into uranium oxide pellets and fabricated into fuel 
assemblies. delivered to plants across the US to be used in their 
nuclear reactors to create energy.
