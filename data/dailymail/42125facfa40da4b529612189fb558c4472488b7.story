A shocking video has emerged of a football supporter being savagely beaten by a rival fan after the League Cup final.

The footage shows a row between Tottenham and Chelsea fans at Wembley Park tube station after the two teams met at the national stadium in London on Sunday.

One the men, who appears to be a Tottenham fan then attacks another man, raining punches on him after pinning him against a wall.

A shocking video has emerged of a football fan savaging a rival after supporters clashed at the weekend

The attack, in which a man was repeatedly punched in the face and chest, took place after Chelsea played Tottenham in the league cup final on Sunday

The row appears to start when a female Chelsea fan's scarf is thrown onto the railway track at the tube station by a rival supporter.

She then challenges another fan and the argument develops into an ugly melee, with a number of men throwing punches at each other.

As the group are broken up, one man emerges shouting 'f****** Chelsea c****' before hitting one man then repeatedly punching another to the face and chest.

The man then holds his arms aloft in apparent celebration as fellow supporters on the opposite platform cheer his actions.

Police then appear  and lead the man away, as other supporters sing chants.

A Tottenham club spokesman said today: 'We are absolutely appalled by this video footage and will take the strongest possible action against any of our supporters who are identifiable including banning orders. We have no wish to be associated with any individual who behaves in this manner.'

A spokesman for Chelsea said the club was  leaving the matter in the hands of the police. 

Although a Chelsea fan appears to be a victim in the incident filmed in the footage, it the latest incident of hooliganism to involve the London club's supporters in recent weeks.

Yesterday, another video emerged appearing to show Chelsea fans chanting the N-word and anti-Semitic slurs - prompting three Asian women and a black man to leave a train.

Filmed on the same day as the latest incident, it showed a man  heard to say on the London to Manchester train: 'Paris, Paris, Paris, that's the way we like it, a n***** on the door'.

It was a reference to another incident that saw a group of Chelsea fans prevent a black man from getting onto a train on the Paris Metro last month before a Champions League game.

A 40-year-old from Brighton has been arrested on suspicion of causing actual bodily harm and bailed in relation to the latest incident.

A second man, aged 35, also from Brighton, was arrested on suspicion of common assault. He has also been bailed until Monday, 23 March.

A British Transport Police spokesman said: 'The vast majority of football fans use trains and stations without problem.

'However, a mindless minority whose intention is to cause trouble make journeys unpleasant for law-abiding fans and other rail passengers and rail staff.'

It comes just the day after another video emerged of Chelsea fans apparently chanting racist words on a train, which was filmed on the same day as the fighting incident

Images of Chelsea supporters refusing to allow a black man onto an underground train in Paris last month shocked the world

The spokesman added: 'We work closely with other police forces, the rail industry and those in football to identify offenders and bring them to justice.

'We support banning orders, where appropriate, that can prohibit trouble-makers from specific areas, including parts of the rail network, at certain times around matches.

'Our officers can, and do, intercept trains to remove anyone causing anti-social behaviour.

'Law-abiding supporters and other passengers and rail staff are our eyes and ears, and we will investigate any incidents reported to us. We particularly welcome any footage from mobile phones that can be sent to us, to help our investigations.'

Chelsea won 2-0 in the League Cup final at Wembley Stadium in north-west London on Sunday, with the goals scored by John Terry and Diego Costa.
