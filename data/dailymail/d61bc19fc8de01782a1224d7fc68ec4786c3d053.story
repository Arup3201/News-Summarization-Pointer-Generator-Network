Barcelona defender Dani Alves is already looking for his next club after the Catalan giants failed to offer him a new contract.

The Brazilian's current deal finishes at the end of this season, which means he is free to negotiate with clubs outside of Spain ahead of a free transfer this summer.

Alves' agent, Dinorah Santana, believes Barca's failure to offer a new contract means the 31-year-old's time at the Nou Camp is up.

'They haven't contacted us,' Santana told Spanish radio station Cadena SER.

'I interpret that silence to mean they don't want Dani Alves, so we will begin searching for a new club.'

Alves has made 16 appearances in La Liga this season and another five in the Champions League but still appears surplus to requirements under Luis Enrique.

Manchester United have shown an interest in the former Sevilla star, who joined Barcelona for £23million back in 2008.

'We won't wait for Barcelona, they have to take the plunge,' added Santana. 'Alves has spent seven years here and he has behaved like a professional at all times.

'Barcelona have not had a sporting director for a month and Alves is free to negotiate with any club. (Former director of football) Andoni Zubizarreta didn't tell us anything.'
