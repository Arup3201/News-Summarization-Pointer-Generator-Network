Voters cannot understand why the bankers who oversaw the collapse of RBS have not been pursued by prosecutors, Vince Cable said last night.

The Business Secretary piled pressure on the authorities to bring Fred Goodwin and other former bosses to account.

A legal report prepared for Mr Cable is understood to have concluded there was 'prosecutable evidence' against several of the bank's executives.

They steered RBS into the biggest corporate disaster in British history, leaving taxpayers with a £45billion bill for its rescue.

Financial crash: Voters cannot understand why the bankers who oversaw the collapse of RBS have not been pursued by prosecutors, Vince Cable (pictured, file photo) said last night

Mr Cable asked Scotland's Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service to consider prosecutions in January 2012.

He is now understood to have asked Lord Advocate Frank Mulholland – Scotland's chief public prosecutor – why there has been no resolution three years on. 

As well as Mr Goodwin, who was stripped of his knighthood in 2012, it is believed that Johnny Cameron, the former head of RBS's investment bank, and a few other directors might also be pursued.

Disqualification, which would ban them from sitting on company boards, could be enacted by the courts or through civil action. 

Mr Cable told the Daily Mail: 'The investigation into the misconduct of directors at RBS has been a long and complicated affair.

'I have spoken to the Lord Advocate, who is responsible for overseeing the investigation in Scotland, and he has updated me on the latest progress of the investigation. 

'Whilst I fully appreciate the complexity and volume of the materials being investigated, I also have a lot of sympathy with ordinary members of the public who cannot understand why it has so far taken three years to look into this.

'I will be keeping abreast of any further developments and will continue to press for these investigations to be concluded as speedily as possible.'

Aides stressed that Mr Cable was not seeking to influence the outcome, but believed voters were angry about the lack of accountability.

Watchdogs who investigated the collapse of RBS found that its directors made a number of poor decisions in the run-up to Labour's £45billion bailout of the bank.

The Financial Services Authority (FSA) concluded bosses had aggressively expanded the institution during Mr Goodwin's eight-year tenure in charge, culminating in the disastrous acquisition of ABN Amro in 2007. 

It found RBS had been brought to its knees by 'multiple poor decisions' and a £50billion 'gamble' on buying the Dutch bank.

The FSA report detailed the strained relationship between the watchdog and Mr Goodwin before 2005, in particular RBS's reluctance to allow its non-executive directors to meet the FSA one-to-one.

'FSA supervisory records from 2004 suggest that RBS management, and in particular the RBS chief executive, had been resistant to what they saw as unnecessary FSA interference,' the watchdog said.

The FSA said Mr Goodwin pushed ahead with the reckless ABN Amro deal without 'a sufficient understanding of the risks involved'.

It added that many would find the idea that no director would face sanctions 'difficult to accept', adding: 'Surely someone can and should be held responsible.'

The report also concluded that Mr Goodwin's 'robust and assertive' management style had been flagged as a potential risk as early as 2003.

The banker won his knighthood under the last government in 2004, only to see it removed by a Whitehall committee following pressure from Prime Minister David Cameron.

A Crown Office spokesman said: 'The Lord Advocate instructed an investigation into allegations involving the Scottish banking sector.

'That investigation is being led by the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service Serious and Organised Crime Division, with assistance from expert forensic accountants and banking specialists. The investigation is complex and ongoing.'

The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) is considering introducing a time limit which could block victims of Britain's biggest mis-selling scandal from making a claim.

Banks have so far paid out £17.3billion to those who were wrongly sold PPI alongside loans and credit cards.

If the FCA proposals are passed, then victims could be barred from making a claim three years after they first realised the mis-selling had taken place.

The City watchdog will announce its plans in the summer, which could involve introducing the deadline, an advertising campaign to alert mis-selling victims who have not yet put in a claim, or other rule changes.

Martin Lewis, of MoneySavingExpert.com, said: 'The banks have been trying to pull a fast one with asking for a time limit for years.

'To make it work fairly for consumers they'd need to put out a multi-million pound advertising campaign over the few years before the limit, so people know they have been mis-sold.

'More importantly they'd need to ensure they stop rejecting people who they know the ombudsman would order them to pay out to, knowing most people won't take it this far ... I can't see either of those things happening, so a time limit should be a strict no-go.' 

Tens of millions of PPI policies were sold between 1990 and 2010 to people taking out loans, mortgages and credit cards. 

They were supposed to protect borrowers who fell ill or lost their jobs. But banks routinely flogged the cover to customers who could never make a claim because they were ineligible to do so. 

Often, victims had no idea they had even been paying for the cover for years.

Since the scandal broke, banks have been inundated with PPI complaints.

Although many of these come from actual wronged customers, others are driven by claims from management firms who sign people up by bombarding them with texts and phone calls. Alongside millions of legitimate claims, banks say they have also spent vast sums wading through vexatious and speculative claims made by these firms.

The independent Financial Ombudsman Service says it is receiving around 4,000 PPI complaints a week, down from a peak of 12,000. It finds in the customer's favour in roughly two-thirds of cases.

Marc Gander, founder of the Consumer Action Group, said: 'I fear that the majority of people who would lose out by a deadline would be those who are vulnerable or elderly. 

The banks had their hands in customers' pockets for years. Victims shouldn't be allowed to be the fall guy a second time around.'
