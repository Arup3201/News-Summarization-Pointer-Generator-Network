Three lapdancers and their female agent were yesterday cleared of kidnapping a nightclub boss in a dispute over unpaid fees.

Curtis Woodman had claimed he was bundled into a car and driven to a field where he was beaten up after refusing to pay the women.

He said he had withheld the money after being forced to close his temporary strip club where they worked because the women had refused to keep some clothes on, breaking the terms of the venue’s licence.

But Mandy Cool, 29, Rachel Goodchild, 24, Stephanie Pye, 31, and their agent Charlotte Devaney, 34, claimed they should have been paid their share of the takings – including half of a £42,000 bill racked up by just one customer.

Mr Woodman claims they set up a kidnapping to force him to pay up.

But Miss Devaney told the jury he had concocted the kidnap story to avoid paying his debts.

‘You don’t make girls take their clothes off and then not pay them to work. It is not a moral thing to do.’

The four women and brothers Robert Morris, 27, and Alexander Morris, 23, were all found not guilty of kidnap following a three and a half week trial at Bristol Crown Court.

Speaking outside court, Miss Devaney said: ‘It is the right verdict. We are now looking forward to getting on with our lives.’

Civil proceedings against Mr Woodman for the share of £42,000 are ongoing. Robert Morris was also acquitted of robbery.

Alexander Morris was convicted of two counts of robbery – taking Mr Woodman’s £4,650 Breitling watch and £60 in cash.

The court had heard how the women confronted Mr Woodman in September 2012, six months after the Cheltenham Festival.

They turned up at the 34-year-old’s office in Tewkesbury, Gloucestershire, in miniskirts and high heels, accompanied by the Morris brothers. The court heard the two men had been enlisted because the women feared Mr Woodman saw them as ‘ditsy strippers’.

Tempers then flared when Mr Woodman described the women as ‘a bunch of prostitutes’ and Robert Morris, who was Mandy Cool’s boyfriend, attacked him, it was claimed.

He says he was punched once in the head before being taken behind a hay bale where Robert Morris continued to punch and kick him.

Mr Woodman claimed he was driven a short way along the M5 motorway before Alexander Morris produced a Stanley knife and insisted Mr Woodman hand over his watch.

Robert Morris told the court that Mr Woodman’s account of the ‘kidnap’ was ridiculous.

He said: ‘There are four women dressed in mini-skirts, daisy dukes and high heels, we stood out, you couldn’t have missed us. I’m a black guy in a tight T-shirt, we all stood out, why did no one spot us if we kidnapped him like he says?’

At the beginning of the trial Alexander Morris admitted carrying a bladed article on the day of the alleged kidnap.

He will be sentenced for that in two weeks’ time, together with the two robbery convictions.
