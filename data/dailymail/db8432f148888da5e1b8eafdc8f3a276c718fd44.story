A Pennsylvania couple married in an emergency room on Friday after the groom had a heart attack 15 minutes before the wedding.

Bob Adams, 68, of North Huntingdon told KDKA he took a nitro pill when he realized he was having a heart attack minutes before his wedding to Mary Pizzuto at the Jacktown Ride and Hunt Club - and thought his outfit was to blame.

'I started feeling a little funny,' he said. 'And I thought it was because I was dressed in a suit and tie, which I never wear.'

The happy couple! Mary Pizzuto and Bob Adams wed in an emergency room on Friday after Adams had a heart attack before their wedding was to take place

Despite his condition, Adams was determined to get hitched.

'He said that he was getting married one way or another, no matter what,' paramedic Rob Leuthold told the station. 'He wanted it to happen.'

Pizzuto, meanwhile, 'was a nervous wreck' as she rode in the front of the ambulance while Adams was in the back, EMT Belt Walter told KDKA.

'She herself had had five heart attacks,' Walter said, 'so they were all worried about her.'

Adams told The Tribune Review he originally wanted to keep going with the ceremony, but relented when minister Rev. John Gropp agreed to come with them to Forbes Hospital.

'I love her. I wanted to go ahead with it,' he said.

It is the bride's first marriage and the groom's third, the paper reports. Pizzuto reconnected with Adams on Facebook after 36 years when her friend - who also happened to be Adams' second wife - died of cancer.

'She helped me after my second wife's death,' Adams told the Tribune-Review.

Adams had some fun with the situation, telling people in the emergency room 'We're not doing the last rites - we're doing a marriage' as Rev. Gropp entered, according to KDKA. The couple will reportedly honeymoon in Las Vegas, it adds, after Adams recuperates from his angioplasty.
