Police investigating the death of Jessica Ridgeway believe an unusual wooden cross could be the key to locating her killer.

Pictures of the cross, which is 1.5 inches tall by 1 inch wide with a hole at the top so it can be worn as a necklace, were released by Westminster Police Department today.

The 10-year-old Colorado girl's dismembered body was discovered in a park 10 miles from her home on October 11, six days after she vanished on her way to school.

Breakthrough: Police believe a sinister wooden cross, pictured, found during the investigation of Jessica Ridgeway's murder could help locate her killer

'Authorities are looking for someone who may carry or wear this type of cross, may have recently purchased one of these, or is known to have some association with one,' Westminster Police Department investigator Trevor Materasso said today.

Police are also looking for local businesses that may sell these types of crosses.

The solid wood pendant has three vertical markings etched into the horizontal bar of the cross and a zig-zag pattern carved into the opposite side.

'The
cross appears to be a solid piece of wood and the upper post portion is
offset from the lower post below the short horizontal section,' Mr Materasso said.

He added that the item 'could become a pivotal piece of evidence that helps authorities identify and locate Jessica's killer.'

Yesterday, police revealed that they 
suspect Jessica's killer may have attempted to abduct a woman in the 
same area months earlier.

In the previous abduction attempt, a 22-year-old woman jogging around a lake about a 
half-mile from the Ridgeway home was grabbed from behind by a man who 
placed a rag with a chemical odor to it over her mouth.

The woman escaped and described her 
attacker as a light-skinned Caucasian male between 18 and 30 years of 
age, 5 feet 6 to 5 feet 8 inches tall with a medium build and brown 
hair.

Police released this 
description yesterday, appealing to the public for information. Today 
they added a cross to that description.

'Police
believe there may be a connection between the Jessica Ridgeway murder 
and the attempted abduction at Ketner Lake, and urge the public to 
specifically look for someone with a cross like this that matches the 
suspect's description from Ketner Lake,' Mr Materasso said.

'In
an ongoing attempt to identify the predator responsible for (Jessica's)
abduction and murder, police are asking the public to look at several 
pictures to see if these will help lead police to the 
killer.'

Jessica Ridgeway disappeared on her 
way to school on October 5, prompting a search by hundreds of police 
officers and scores of volunteers.

Any
hope of finding the girl alive was dashed six days later when police 
said they had found the 'not intact' remains of a girl in a park area 
about 10 miles from the Ridgeway home.

A day later, police positively 
identified the remains of as those of Jessica, turning the search for 
the girl into a hunt for a killer that FBI profilers are certain is 
male.

After police questioned the girl's parents, they were both ruled out as suspects in their daughter's abduction and murder.

A task force comprised of local, state and federal law enforcement is looking into some 4,000 tips that have come into the command centre, police said.

More than 2,000 family members, friends, neighbors and others gathered on Tuesday to remember the 10-year-old suburban Denver girl who tragically lost her life after being snatched on her way to school.

The ceremony at Faith Bible Chapel in Arvada opened with a slideshow of pictures set to the Jessica's favorite songs, including Call Me Maybe by Carly Rae Jepsen. Many attendees wore the fifth-grader's favorite color, purple.

Westminster Police Chief Lee Birk said at the evening service that investigators are working the case 'tirelessly, diligently, and we are committed until we achieve justice for Jessica.'

Earlier, police said they had received more than 350 more phone tips on Tuesday.
