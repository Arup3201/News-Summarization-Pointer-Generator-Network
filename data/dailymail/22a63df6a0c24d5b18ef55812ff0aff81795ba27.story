Urgency: David Cameron called off a long awaited speech on Europe

David Cameron dramatically called off a long-awaited speech last night in which he was due to warn Britain is heading towards the EU exit unless key powers are returned.

In the wake of the bloodbath in Algeria, the Prime Minister abandoned a planned trip to the Netherlands, where he had been due to deliver a landmark address on Britain’s future in Europe.

Mr Cameron had initially been expected to make the speech at last autumn’s Conservative Party conference, but it has been repeatedly delayed. It is now not clear when it will happen.

The Prime Minister plans to promise the first referendum on Britain’s place in Europe since 1975.

When the speech is finally delivered, he will say the UK no longer accepts one of the founding principles of the EU – that membership means ‘ever closer union’, according to senior sources.

He will insist that powers must flow in both directions between member states and Brussels, setting out plans to renegotiate the terms of Britain’s membership before asking voters to accept or reject it in a vote expected to take place in 2018.

Senior Eurosceptic Tories, including Iain Duncan Smith and Liam Fox, are content with Mr Cameron’s stance.

But the long-delayed speech will lead to demands from dozens of Tory MPs for the Prime Minister to legislate for a referendum before the next election – even without the support of the Liberal Democrats.

MPs are also insisting a referendum pledge must be a ‘red line’ in any future coalition negotiation with the Lib Dems, warning it cannot simply be ditched if Mr Cameron fails to win an outright majority and seeks a new power-sharing deal with Nick Clegg.

Warning: Mr Cameron was to warn that the UK could exit the EU if powers do not 'flow in both directions' between member states and Brussels

Downing Street sources said Mr Cameron, who had chosen the Netherlands as his venue because it is a founding member of the EU and shares some of Britain’s concerns about the need for reform, would set out a ‘positive vision’ of how Britain can remain in a changed EU.

But he risked infuriating Eurocrats by warning them that their union could fall apart unless they addressed a growing democratic deficit felt not just in Britain but across the Continent.

In extracts released by No 10 before the speech was called off last night, Mr Cameron said: ‘I want to speak to you today with urgency and frankness about the European Union and how it must change – both to deliver prosperity and to retain the support of its peoples.

‘I come here as British Prime Minister with a positive vision for the future of the European Union. A future in which Britain wants, and should want, to play a committed and active part.’

Mr Cameron was to argue that there were three challenges that threatened the EU – the eurozone crisis, competitiveness and public support – which must be addressed.

‘Why raise fundamental questions about the future of Europe when Europe is already in the midst of a deep crisis?

'Why raise questions about Britain’s role when support in Britain is already so thin?’ he was due to say.

‘There are always voices saying, “Don’t ask the difficult questions”. But it’s essential for Europe – and for Britain – that we do because there are three major challenges confronting us today.

‘First, the problems in the eurozone are driving fundamental change in Europe. Second, there is a crisis of European competitiveness, as other nations across the world soar ahead.

‘And third, there is a gap between the EU and its citizens which has grown dramatically in recent years and which represents a lack of democratic accountability and consent that is – yes – felt particularly acutely in Britain.’

The Prime Minister had been expected to point to a rise in anti-EU sentiment in countries that have been forced to implement austerity measures in order to remain in the union.

‘There is a growing frustration that the EU is seen as something that is done to people rather than acting on their behalf, and this is being intensified by the very solutions required to resolve the economic problems,’ he was due to say.

He believes the best opportunity to reshape Britain’s relationship with the EU will be offered by treaty change to allow the countries of the eurozone to forge a closer economic and political union designed to keep the single currency together.

Repatriation of powers on social and employment law and a UK opt-out from policing and criminal justice measures are seen as key areas.

Last night former Belgian PM Guy Verhofstadt, a leading federalist, likened the Prime Minister to ‘a suicide bomber threatening to blow himself up unless he gets his own way’. He added: ‘Cameron will not succeed if he attempts to hold his European partners to ransom.’

Provocative: MEP Graham Watson's Tweet

A Lib Dem MEP provoked widespread disgust last night when he claimed the terrorists had won by forcing Mr Cameron to abandon his speech in Amsterdam.

Sir Graham Watson, leader of the liberal grouping in Brussels, tweeted: ‘Al Qaeda 1, @David_Cameron 0.’

A senior Government source said: ‘That is completely inappropriate.’
