Read Matt Lawton on why Whelan is a man stuck in the past on the issue of race 

Wigan owner Dave Whelan is the subject of a new FA race investigation after making extraordinarily offensive remarks about Jewish people and the Chinese.

Whelan, 77, attempted to defend the appointment of controversial Scot Malky Mackay as his new manager by playing down racist, sexist and homophobic texts sent and received by the 42-year-old while he was manager of Cardiff City.

But in doing so, Whelan only managed to whip up a fresh storm by claiming his manager's texts referring to 'Chinks' and Jews pursuing money were merely indicative of general opinion in this country.

Dave Whelan risks ostracising himself from football after his outburst about Jews

Malky Mackay was appointed Wigan boss this week, despite the text and email scandal

'The Jews don't like losing money,' said Whelan. 'Nobody likes losing money. Do you think Jewish people chase money a little bit more than we do? I think they are very shrewd people. It's telling the truth. Jewish people love money, English people love money; we all love money.

'If any Englishman said he has never called a Chinaman a 'chink' he is lying. There is nothing bad about doing that. It's like calling the British Brits or the Irish paddies.' 

Whelan's remarks came in an interview published online by the Guardian. Shortly before that, the Wigan owner had learned that one of the club's shirt sponsors — Premier Range — was severing ties with Wigan as a result of the decision to appoint Mackay. A second commercial partner, drinks supplier iPro Sport, also cut its links with the club over the Mackay arrival.

Mackay himself is still under investigation by the FA for his part in the text scandal uncovered by Sportsmail in August. This means that Wigan manager and his club owner find themselves in the undignified position of being investigated by the FA for similar alleged offences at the same time.

Whelan had claimed at a press conference to unveil Mackay as manager on Wednesday that FA sources had told him there were unlikely to be any charges brought against his new coach.

But the FA said: 'We wish to make it clear that the FA investigation into the conduct of Malky Mackay remains ongoing and no assurances have been given by the FA as to the outcome of this case. The FA did not come into possession of the relevant evidence relating to the messages until mid-October. 

'The FA is still investigating whether these messages indicate a culture in which other acts of a discriminatory nature may have taken place. This process inevitably takes time.'

Premier Range ended their sponsorship deal with Wigan over Mackay's appointment

Mackay, who was sacked by Cardiff's Malaysian owner Vincent Tan last Christmas, took Wigan training for the first time on Thursday as he prepares them for his first game, at home to Middlesbrough on Saturday.

Now, however, there is a fresh storm to weather, even if it was not one of his own making on this occasion.

Whelan tried to back down from his comments when contacted by Sportsmail.

He said: 'I don't know how it's come across but it's unfair if it's come across like that. What I said is this: Malky criticised somebody and called them a name. We all get called names. We get called Limeys, Brits. The Scots get called Jocks. And we don't take a blind bit of notice. I don't know what all this is about. 

Whelan's archaic views have been slammed by the Jewish Leadership Council

'There's a big difference if you criticise a black person because that is something I would never ever do or agree to.

'I would never even dream of that. That is something that is totally taboo. Everybody on the planet is equal and everybody who plays football is equal and I believe in that. I go to Barbados a lot. I have friends, black people, white people, everybody is the same and everybody should be treated the same on the planet and that's all I have to say on the subject. We are all equal under the sun. OK?'

Whelan later appeared on Sky Sports in an attempt to repair some of the damage and apologised for his published comments, saying: 'I would never upset a Jewish person, I hold them in the highest regard. I have loads of Jewish friends. If anyone takes offence to what I've said, please accept my apologies.

'It's either a misquote, or I've done 50 interviews that day. Please accept my sincere apologies if they feel that way.

'I've got loads of Chinese friends too. I would never insult the Chinese. They take that name (chinks) a bit more serious, and they get more upset than the British people do (about the name Brits). I understand the Chinese and I understand their view completely. I apologise on my behalf and on behalf of the club. 

'Our reputation, I don't want it tarnished. We're not the biggest club, but we're very, very honest and we're a happy club.' 

Whelan appeared on Sky Sports News late on Thursday night and apologised for his comments

Whelan's decision to hand Mackay a return to football has been widely criticised

Sponsors Premier Range — who became Wigan's first 'back of the shirt' sponsor in the summer — had explained earlier their decision to withdraw over Mackay's arrival.

A spokesman said: 'The texts Mr Mackay has admitted to sending are wholly unacceptable — and the thoughts expressed within them are a shocking reminder of a past we thought football had left behind. A team that would employ a man who expresses views such as these is not the kind of team Premier Range wish to deal with.' 

Asked about this, Whelan expressed a rather forlorn hope that he had not damaged his club's reputation for ever.

'I hope I've not, because I have no intention of doing that,' he added. 'But I think when it gets to the end of the season there may be a big change in attitude, even after a few games. The man we have appointed, he's a very honest and open man. He's done something wrong. He's made the apology. Let's forgive and forget.'

One of the first people to criticise Whelan, before the apology on Sky, was West Ham joint chairman David Gold, who is Jewish. 

Sportsmail's Matt Lawton exclusively broke the story about Mackay's obscene messages

He said: 'His remarks are offensive. I hope he retracts it because it will damage relationships between him and many other people. I hope Dave will see the hurt this has given many people, retracts it and says he didn't really mean it.'

'If I have upset one person I apologise,' Whelan told BBC Sport. 'All I was trying to say was that Jewish people are very similar to the English people in the desire to work hard and get money. I didn't think that I did anything wrong in that.'

Kick It Out, the game's equality and inclusion organisation, also released a statement in response to Whelan's comments, saying: 'The remarks act as another example of the culture which continues to exist within football, and further prove that some in positions of power seem comfortable sharing those views either privately or publicly.

'These comments must not go unchallenged and have to be investigated by the FA.' 

We wish to make it clear The FA investigation into the conduct of Malky Mackay and Iain Moody remains ongoing and no assurances have been given by The FA as to the outcome of this case.

In the particular and exceptional circumstances of this case, The FA would like to provide some clarification as to the status of the investigation.

The FA did not come into possession of the relevant evidence relating to the messages until mid-October.

This came out of many thousands of emails and texts and we are still in the process of obtaining additional information.

Iain Moody and Mackay are both the subject of an FA investigation

The FA is still investigating whether these messages indicate a culture in which other acts of a discriminatory nature may have taken place.

This process inevitably takes time.

Both Mr Mackay and Mr Moody are fully co-operating with the ongoing process.

We fully appreciate the need to act expeditiously on this matter.

However, it remains a complex investigation and The FA will make no further comment at this time.
