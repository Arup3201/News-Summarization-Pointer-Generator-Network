Skinnygirl millionaire and reality star Bethenny Frankel has denied she is dating billionaire Warren Lichtenstein after being named as his 'girlfriend' in a bitter legal suit.

The 43-year-old mom-of-one, who is currently going through her own difficult divorce from husband Jason Hoppy, was named in court papers filed by Mr Lichtenstein's ex-girlfriend Annabelle Bond.

Miss Bond, who has a six-year-old daughter called Isabella with Mr Lichtenstein, named the former Real Housewives of New York star as her former lover's girlfriend while suing him for $570,110.05 in child support.

Bethenny and Mr Lichtenstein were pictured together on vacation in St Tropez in the South of France last July. However, today a source told MailOnline that Bethenny is still dating her financier toyboy Michael Cerussi - and is 'very happy'.

Dragged in: Bethenny Frankel - seen on Saturday in New York with her daughter Bryn - has found herself at the center of a legal suit between her close friend Warren Lichtenstein and his ex-lover and the mother of his daughter, Annabelle Bond

At war: Billionaire Warren Lichtenstein and his ex lover and mother of his daughter, British adventurer Annabelle Bond, who has filed suit calling him a 'deadbeat dad' and naming Bethenny Frankel as his 'girlfriend'

The source added: 'Bethenny and Warren have been friends and ONLY friends for many, many years.'

According to the New York Post, the suit says Warren, who runs the $4 billion hedge fund Steel Partners, is 'traveling the world on private jets, expanding his 
huge compound in Aspen . . . living in a beachfront mansion in 
[California], and dating [former “Real Housewives” star and talk-show 
host] Bethany (sic) Frankel.' But that Mr Lichtenstein, 'claims that he is 
too broke to support his only daughter.'

British adventurer and heiress Miss Bond, who is the daughter of former Vodafone and HSBC chairman 
Sir John Bond, has conquered Everest and was the first woman to complete the Seven Summits by climbing the highest peak on every continent in record time.

She filed the suit on March 28 in New York's Supreme Court claiming that Mr Lichtenstein is a 'deadbeat father' who owes her $570,110.05 in child support, while 
living an 'extravagant playboy lifestyle.'

The couple split in April 2007 when Miss Bond was five months pregnant, and following Isabella's birth, she told the Daily Mail: 'I am happy. He is happy. We're both thrilled about the baby, but we are no longer together. No one else is involved.'

Miss Bond’s child support ruling was made in
 Hong Kong, where she lives and is dating a Tampa Bay Rays owner, Andrew
 Cader.

Meanwhile, Mr Lichenstein last year accused Miss Bond in his own legal suit against Mr Cader of pursuing the massive child support 
settlement against him to, “improve upon her own already extraordinary 
life of leisure, luxury, privilege and modest fame.”

He alleged Mr 
Cader was conspiring to defraud him by giving Miss Bond millions in loans to 
inflate her child support needs, but later withdrew the 
suit.

Bethenny and Mr Lichtenstein were first linked together in January 2013 - and Bethenny was said to have moved into his sprawling Upper East side home with her daughter Bryn.

However, a friend said at the time there was NO romance between the pair, adding: 'Bethenny and Warren have been great friends for more than 20 years and he has really been a support system during this sad time.

Cosy: Skinnygirl founder Bethenny Frankel has moved out of her $5 million Tribeca apartment - where her ex-husband Jason Hoppy still lives - as her relationship with Michael Cerussi grows

'Bethenny stayed at Warren's apartment 
one night earlier this month with her daughter Bryn as he was out of 
town, so  that she and Bryn could have some girl time.

However, as her romance with Michael 'Mac' Cerussi, who at 34 is nine years her junior, heating up, Bethenny HAS moved into a rented apartment while her ex husband stays in their $5 million Tribeca home during the divorce.

Bethenny and Michael, the son of a prominent New York lawyer, were frolicking on the beach on a sun-soaked New Year's Eve trip to Miami.

The couple were seen sharing a tender kiss on New Year’s Eve at the Mondrian Hotel in South Beach in Miami.

A source told E! 'The reason Bethenny did it is that Jason is still living at the original home.

'On the weekends, his parents come and sleep on the sofas. It's incredibly uncomfortable for Bethenny and it gives her and Bryn no space to have one on one time.'

In October, Bethenny, who is thought to have sold her Skinnygirl brand for $120 million, revealed on her talk show Bethenney that she and her ex were still living under the same roof.

The brunette filed for divorce from Jason in January 2013 after two years of marriage, and in September, Hoppy was photographed still wearing his wedding ring, a whopping nine months after the couple announced their separation.

'Jason is still holding out on signing off on the divorce,' the source claimed.
