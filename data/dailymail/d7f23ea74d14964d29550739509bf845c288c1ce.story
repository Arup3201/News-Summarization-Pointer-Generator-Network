Disgraced former New York Governor Eliot Spitzer is reportedly dating a press secretary for Mayor-elect Bill De Blasio - and has been spotted having late-night liaisons at her Manhattan apartment.

Spitzer, 54, who is still married to wife Silda, has been pictured slipping into the home of 31-year-old Lis Smith, who recently worked on his failed bid for New York City Comptroller.

The former governor, who resigned in 2008 after admitting he had paid thousands of dollars for high-class prostitutes, was seen twice last week arriving at Smith's Soho apartment, taking her to a candle-lit dinner, then disappearing back upstairs.

The New York Post snapped pictures of Spitzer arriving around 10pm two nights in a row last week, then leaving before dawn.

The disgraced politician was seen dashing from the building shortly before 6am before hopping in a cab a few streets away.

On one occasion, the pair walked together from the apartment to a nearby restaurant, the cozy French bistro Le Pescadeux.

The manager of the restaurant told the Post that the couple were regulars, adding: 'The first time I saw Spitzer, I didn’t know if he was Eliot Spitzer or Anthony Weiner. Those two are like the same exact guy.'

After the romantic meal, the couple were seen entering Miss Smith's apartment building together.

Spitzer and his wife Silda remain married five and a half years after the scandal that cratered his meteoric political career.

However,
 multiple reports indicate that he and Silda have been living apart and Mrs Spitzer was noticeably absent from the campaign trail this past year.

Miss Smith joined De Blasio after Spitzer lost in the September primary. She has also served as the spokeswoman for the Mayor-elect during his transition.

The Daily News reports that Miss Smith is a frontrunner to become De Blasio's press secretary after he is formally sworn in.

In 2012, she led the 'rapid response team' on President Obama's reelection campaign.

Spitzer
 has repeatedly refused to comment on his personal life and says he is 
only staying at his parents' apartment because they are in poor health.

A former colleague of Miss Smith's told MailOnline: 'Lis is one of the best political operatives in the country and her private dating life is not going to change any of that. Her accomplishments stand on their own.'

Miss Smith refused to directly comment about whether or not she is in a relationship with 
the disgraced former Governor.

Spitzer has been named as a possible 
presidential candidate before a federal investigation revealed him as 
'Client 9' of Emporer's Club VIP, which ran $1,000-an-hour call girls.
