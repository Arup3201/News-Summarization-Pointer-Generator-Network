Guilty: Anthony McSweeney has been convicted of indecent assault on a young boy 35 years ago

A Catholic priest dubbed the 'fat vicar' was today found guilty of sexually abusing a boy in a care home and downloading child porn onto his computer.

Father Anthony McSweeney, 68, faces jail after he was convicted of preying on the vulnerable boy while he was working at Grafton Close Children's Home in Hounslow, west London, more than 30 years ago.

The care home was run by McSweeney's friend John Stingemore, who was found dead in January weeks before he was due to stand trial alongside the priest.

Southwark Crown Court heard that McSweeney watched young boys shower for his own sexual gratification, and kept a collection of child porn at home.

He denied being a paedophile - but today a jury of six men and five women found him guilty of indecent assault and three counts of making indecent images of children.

The attack on the young boy took place between 1979 and 1981, while the child porn was found on his laptop after he was arrested in 2013.

McSweeney was cleared of three indecent assaults on two other boys at the care home and taking a pornographic photo of one of these boys.

The 20st priest was once enlisted by TV cook Delia Smith to hold a special football service at Norwich City.

And he officiated at the 1990 wedding of boxing star Frank Bruno and his now ex-wife Laura.

McSweeney was investigated as part of Operation Fernbridge, the police probe into an alleged VIP paedophile ring at Grafton Close and Elms Guest House in Barnes, west London.

Stingemore used his connections to help get his close friend a job at Grafton Close, where they molested vulnerable boys together, the court heard.

McSweeney watched as a teenage boy was abused by Stingemore in the care home shower.

Denial: The Catholic priest insisted he had no sexual interest in children but was found guilty by a jury

Three years earlier, McSweeney was seen ogling a Boy Scout as he washed at a retreat.

When the boy reported him to a warden he was told not to be 'stupid and make trouble', and his mother slapped him because a 'priest would not do anything like that'.

A schoolboy from Grafton Close told the court that McSweeney was 'touchy feely' and referred to him as a 'fat vicar'.

He said that the priest went into his bedroom and told him he had to take his clothes off for a 'medical', before taking photographs of him on a Polaroid camera.

Friend: John Stingemore was set to face a string of  charges alongside Sweeney but was found dead in January this year

The priest confessed to watching a porn film featuring boys as young as ten on a home cinema with Stingemore - but claimed he turned it off in disgust.

And he denied molesting boys as they sat on his lap, claiming he was too fat to do so.

Stingemore was sacked from Grafton Close in mysterious circumstances in 1981, and McSweeney's visits abruptly stopped as he continued with his career in the priesthood.

In 1998 McSweeney nearly lost his job when his cleaner discovered his stash of sex toys, truncheons and pornographic videos at St Peter's Catholic Church in Leigh-on-Sea in Essex.

She played one of the tapes and saw it featured two boys between 14 and 16 years old having sex, the court heard.

McSweeney was originally told that he would be 'banished' from the priesthood, but after around six months was quietly moved to a new parish, St George's in Norwich.

The defendant, who now lives in Pease Pottage, West Sussex, was told he could be jailed when he is sentenced in a month's time.

Judge Alistair McCreath said: 'You are not to come to court in four weeks thinking to yourself that the judge gave me bail and therefore I'm not to go to prison, because that would be a false hope.'

Responding to today's verdict, Gillian Norton of Richmond Council said: 'The council is sorry that a child in its care was indecently assaulted.

'The assault happened 35 years ago and clearly the service leadership and management laid bare in court were totally unacceptable. The situation today is completely different.'

Detective Chief Inspector Keith Braithwaite of Metropolitan Police said: 'McSweeney was an abuser who used his role in a position of trust.

'I would like to pay tribute to the courage of the victim in speaking out against McSweeney. It was that testimonial that secured the charges and enabled this case to be brought to court.

'I would also like to thank those witnesses who provided key evidence that ensured the court could hear what sort of man McSweeney really is.'

The Bishop of East Anglia, Alan Hopes, said that McSweeney had been barred from the ministry since his arrest and will now face disciplinary action.

He said: 'These are grave crimes, and I wish to reassure firstly the victims and all of those affected that I take the matter very seriously.

'As a bishop and as an ordinary member of society, I share the experience of great sorrow and regret that such offences take place.

'The later offences of accessing indecent images of children whilst serving as a priest have both served to compound the abuse already committed on the children themselves, and breached the trust that was placed in him as a minister in the Church and those who held him in high regard.

'I wish to assure the victims and their families that their suffering is taken seriously by the Church.'
