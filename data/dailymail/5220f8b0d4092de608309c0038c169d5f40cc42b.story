A physical education teacher injured in Tuesday's shooting at 
Reynolds High School saved lives by rushing to the main office and 
initiating a lockdown procedure, Troutdale Police said.

The yet-to-be-identified gunman shot PE teacher Todd Rispler and a 14-year-old student before reportedly committing suicide. Freshman Emilio Hoffman didn't survive the attack, but Rispler was able to escape since the bullet only grazed his hip.

On Tuesday afternoon, Troutdale Police Chief Scott Anderson held a press conference in which he detailed the timeline of events during the shooting, thanking Rispler for his quick actions that saved lives.

The unidentified gunman entered the school's separate gym building armed around 8am Tuesday morning and proceeded to open fire.

At some point, the gunman shot and hit both Rispler and Hoffman. Hoffman was found dead in the men's locker room, while the gunman's body was later found in a different restroom.

Despite being hit, Rispler ran to the school's main office to warn the rest of the students about the active shooter situation.

Anderson said the quick action of both Rispler and local authorities 'saved many of our students lives'.

It's still uncertain whether the shooter was targeting a specific person in the attack. Authorities have tentatively identified the gunman, but have yet to release his name to the public.

Rispler's family report that he is recovering fine after his brush with gunfire.

'They just stitched him up,' brother-in-law Jeff Nelson told the Oregonian. 'I don't think any bones were hit. It's a blessing.'

Rispler has been described as a beloved teacher and former athletics coach at the school, his alma mater.

His students have since taken to Twitter to thank him for his selfless act.

'Rispler's a hero. Ran to the office after getting shot to get the school on lockdown' one student wrote.

Rispler
 and his three siblings grew up in the area and all attended Reynolds 
where Todd was the star quarterback during his freshman year.

'Rispler deserve a medal,' one student wrote

'He was being looked at by every major university. He was going to be all-American,' Nelson said.Â 

However, his career came to an end after a head-on collision with a line backer that sent him to the hospital and nearly paralyzed him.

After that injury, Rispler set his sights on becoming a teacher and coach.

He went on to get a masters of education from Portland
 State University before returning home to Reynolds where he currently 
teaches PE and has coached basketball, football and track. He was even 
voted state track coach of the year once.

'He
 loves to coach kids,'Rispler's older brother Bob said. 'He's very 
encouraging. He's technically astute. He has a great rapport with kids.'

Rispler lives nearby with his wife and their two daughters, who are middle and high school age in the Gresham School District.
