Holland striker Klaas-Jan Huntelaar believes he should be given the chance to start for his country in their next match against Iceland on Monday, after coming off the bench to score on Friday.

Guus Hiddink's side trailed Kazakhstan by a single goal when Huntelaar came on as a 56th minute substitute, but the Schalke striker was on target within five minutes as the Dutch came back to collect win 3-1.

And while Huntelaar stopped short of criticising his manager, he insisted that he deserves a chance from the start.

'If it was up to me, obviously I would start every game, but that decision is up to the coach,' Huntelaar said on uefa.com. 

'The important thing is always to be sharp and score when the opportunity arises. When the spaces are small, the crosses have to be good.

Robin van Persie wrapped up the three points from the penalty spot late on in the game 

'I always want to score as quickly as possible, whether I am in the starting lineup or playing as a substitute. It was important to score fast, so there was still time to score a second.'

Holland's win lifts them to third in Group A, but a defeat to the Czech Republic in their first game means they are still three points behind Monday's opponents Iceland, who have won their two games without conceding a goal.
