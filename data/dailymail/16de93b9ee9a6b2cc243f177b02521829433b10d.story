A budding British entrepreneur has high hopes for a piece of unique artwork he spectacularly created on the outskirts of space.

Josh Taylor, 22, from Guildford, Surrey, created his world-first artwork by using a helium-filled weather balloon with attached canvas and dripping paint tubes to float the project to an incredible 100,810ft.

The freelance media technician sent
his contraption soaring towards space from a field
in Worcester, West Midlands, with it crashing back down to earth when the balloon popped two hours later some 40 miles north of the launch site.

He said: 'I did it really to push boundaries. It's a world first thing, I wanted to do something that nobody has done before. It was a great feeling to achieve something like that.'

He continued: 'I try and do creative, 
science and technology projects in order to inspire other people, 
entertain and educate them.'

Josh's contraption was made up of a large helium-filled weather balloon, attached at the bottom to a payload which consisted of a parachute, small GoPro HD camera, four paint pots with hanging tubes and the canvas, attached by wires.

As the project floated up to the edge of Earth's atmosphere, paint dripped down from the tubes onto the canvas, creating the artwork.

Once the project reached an incredible 100,810ft, the weather balloon popped, causing it to fall at incredible speeds back down to earth. After an automated parachute was deployed, the artwork touched down about 2 hours after it had been launched.

Josh was able to track the artwork because he added a tracker to the payload.

He said: 'Within the payload we had a tracker which allowed us to track it using radio telemetry.

After we launched it, we kept on having it relay data back to the computer and that allowed us to see where it was in relation to the car.'

He continued: 'We drove about 40 miles north to find it. The tracker worked so well that within 15 minutes of it landing we had picked it back up.

'I'd like to exhibit it in an art 
gallery somewhere, purely for others to see it and for it to hopefully 
inspire others to be creative.'

In 2011, Josh completed a project which saw him send a camera up into space to record the curvature of the Earth.

Josh's next project, which was a challenge laid down for him on social networking site Twitter by Virgin boss Richard Branson, is to discover the depths of the ocean.
