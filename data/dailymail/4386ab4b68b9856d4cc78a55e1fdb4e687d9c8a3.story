Recent thunderstorms in NSW could have a direct impact on the number of Sydney rock oysters available  in the lead up to Christmas.

Heavy rain has halted harvesting of the oysters grown in the majority of waterways on the NSW far south coast from Batemans Bay to the Victorian border, the ABC reports.

Growers, who have been forced to stop harvesting until storm water run-off subsides, now fear they won't meet Christmas demand for oysters.

The harvesting of oysters on New South Wales' south coast has halted due to heavy rain  

Wholesalers may be forced to source rock oysters from Tasmania and South Australia if the harvest is delayed by long periods. 

Farmer Andy Baker said the torrential rain caught him off-guard and he wasn't able to bring in the oysters at his Pambula Lake farm prior to the storms. 

'I've been at this job a long time. I read it wrong on Saturday,' he said. 

Oyster farms like this one in Coffin Bay have been affected by the recent rain storms  

'I thought we might have got up to 25 millimetres of rain but I didn't think we'd get over 70 millimetres as quickly as we did.'

Mr Baker and several other farmers managed to bring in several oysters prior to the storms.  

'Pambula Lake is probably going to be shut for at least a fortnight,' he said. 

A few farmers were able to save their oyster harvest by storing them before the storms hit 

While Mr Baker admits he might not be open again until the New Year, he is remaining optimistic. 

'There's money in mud and this is an inconvenience at the moment, but in the next weeks and months and even the season ahead, this rain is a blessing,' he said.  

Oysters could now be off the menu at Christmas because of the bad weather
