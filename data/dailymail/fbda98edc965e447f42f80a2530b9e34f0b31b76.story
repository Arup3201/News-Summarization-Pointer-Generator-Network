A security guard has told how he watched in horror as a teenager hanging by his fingertips from a shopping centre balcony let go and plunged 80 feet, landing on a shopper walking below.

Lakhdar Segar, 31, rushed to help when he was alerted to the 18-year-old dangling from the second floor barrier at Westfield in Stratford yesterday.

But the Miss Selfridge security guard could only watch in dismay as 'a couple of seconds later' the boy let go and fell two floors, crushing a 47-year-old man walking beneath.

'I looked outside and I saw a man hanging onto the balcony by both hands and dangling over the edge,' Mr Segar said.

'He was just hanging there very still. He was holding on and within a 
couple of seconds he let go and he was gone. He didn't say anything when
he fell down, he just fell in silence.'

The security guard said he had hoped to help the teenager back on to solid ground, but the 18-year-old dropped out of sight before he could reach him.

'I was going to go over and help him. When I looked outside I was about to walk around to where he was and try to speak to him,' he said.

'In my mind I thought, if I can get over there I can help him, but he jumped too quickly. There just wasn't time to help him.

'I thought, if only he had held on a bit longer someone might have been able to get to him, but it just happened too quickly.

'It was horrible to see someone like that, I don't know what he was thinking.

'I have thought about that moment, 
and wondered if he was alright. I am thankful he didn't die, it would 
have been horrible to see the last moments of someone's life.'

Incident: Police were called to the scene after stunned shoppers saw the man fall from the upper floor and land on the pedestrian at about 3.30pm yesterday

Peering over the balcony to the 
ground floor where the teenager had landed on a passing shopper, Mr 
Segar described hearing groans of pain.

'Once he landed on the floor below I could hear groaning, it sounded like he was in a lot of pain,' the security guard said.

'I looked over the balcony and could 
see him laying on the floor and another man lying near him. The old man 
he had hit was looking up, but he seemed really dazed.

'Three women went over to try and help them.

'Then the police cordoned the area off.'

The teenager and the injured shopper were both
taken to hospital with serious injuries and kept overnight for 
treatment following the terrifying incident yesterday.

Police were 
called to the scene after stunned shoppers saw the 18-year-old man fall 
from an upper floor and land on the 47-year-old pedestrian outside the 
Party Fiesta store, on The Arcade, in the shopping centre.

Witnesses were reported to have seen the man dangling from the balcony by his arms and shouting moments before he fell.

Some shoppers suggested they had seen him jump: 'Just saw a dude jump to commit suicide,' one Twitter user wrote.

Others blamed the design of the shopping centre for the incident. Paolo Vignali wrote: 'Always said the barriers in Westfield Stratford were too low.'

The
18-year-old man is from nearby Manor Park, according to police, while 
the 47-year-old victim - who was out shopping with his wife - is from 
Dunmow in Essex.

A shop 
assistant at Party Fiesta said: 'I was serving some customers and then I
heard a loud crash like a car crash, and then everybody in the shop 
just started screaming and shouting - it was really scary.

'I
went outside and I saw a big black guy, he had fallen and hit a man. 
They were both lying there on the floor, the white man was moving but 
the black man was totally unconscious.

'The man who was hit was with his wife, she was really upset, crying and shaken up by it.

'The man who was hit was obviously in
a lot of pain and was touching his shoulder, but he wasn't crying, he 
was in shock. It looked like he was disorientated and hadn't quite 
realised what had happened.

'The black man was really, really 
tall, around 6ft, and he was broad and stocky, if you get hit by him it 
is going to really hurt you.

'One of the shoppers was a doctor who
was walking around carrying his baby in his arms, when he saw the 
accident he rushed over and was helping to treat both of the men.'

A worker at a nearby store told the Evening Standard: 'There was lots of shouting before it happened so I thought the man might
have been in a fight. but then we heard it was attempted suicide.'

Another one expressed anger at the 
situation and accused the man who fell of endangering shoppers, telling 
the Standard: 'There are so many families in this part of the centre, 
mothers walking with prams and pushchairs.

'I just thank god it wasn’t any of them who got hit or a child. If it had been a new-born child, they wouldn’t have survived.'

Investigation: Police have said inquiries are ongoing to establish the full circumstances of the incident

A Metropolitan Police 
spokesman said officers were called at 3.36pm yesterday to reports of a 
man having fallen from an upper floor.

The
spokesman said: 'The man fell upon a male pedestrian who was walking 
beneath. Officers and London Ambulance Service attended.

'Both men were taken by LAS to an east London hospital suffering serious injuries - we await an update on their conditions.

'Newham officers are investigating. Enquiries are ongoing to establish the full circumstances of the incident.'

This morning a spokesman confirmed that both men were still at Royal London Hospital in Whitechapel in a stable condition.

Westfield shopping centre, Stratford, to reports of a person who had 
fallen from a height.

'We sent two ambulance crews, 
two single responders in cars, a duty officer and a team from London's 
Air Ambulance in a car to the scene.

'Our staff treated two patients - both men. The first (who fell from a height) had leg and pelvic injuries.

'The second had a head injury and back pain. Both were taken to the Royal London Hospital.'
