Carl Froch will have to make a better start against George Groves in Saturday's Battle of Britain rematch if he is to hold onto his world titles, according to former heavyweight champion David Haye.

Froch was put on the floor for only the second time in his career by Groves in the first round when the pair met back in November.

And Haye says that the Cobra must learn from his mistakes if he is to beat Groves again and retain his IBF and WBA super-middleweight belts.

Haye said: 'Carl Froch vs George Groves II is the fight of the year. It is the fight that everyone is losing their mind over.

'After I have seen the first round, I will know who the victor is.

'I don't know how either of them are going to start, whether they are going to do exactly the same thing, whether Carl will get dropped in the first round?

Controversial: Referee Howard Foster stopped the fight in Froch's favour in the ninth round

'I don't see that happening this time round, because Carl knows that now, he did not respect George's power first time round, this time he will.

'But now George will respect Carl's power of recovery, so he is going to be on it even more. So you can make arguments for both fighters because it was such an evenly matched fight.'

Froch won the fight in November via a controversial ninth round stoppage in Manchester and with 80,000 fans set to watch the re-match at Wembley Haye can understand why the fight has captured the public's imagination.

Haye knows both fighters well. He worked with Groves in his early days as a professional as part of his Hayemaker stable under promoter and trainer Adam Booth and is a former roommate of Froch's going back to their amateur days 15 years ago.

And Haye does not expected any of the 80,000 fans to be short changed after Saturday's rematch.

Haye added: 'The decision at the end to stop the fight raised a lot of eyebrows and that is why this fight is happening again.

'Rightly it has gone to a bigger venue, Wembley Stadium is absolutely massive. And if ever a fight deserved to be staged there it is this one.

'Both are very nice guys. I know both of them very well and they will both put it all on the line and give everyone their money's worth.'
