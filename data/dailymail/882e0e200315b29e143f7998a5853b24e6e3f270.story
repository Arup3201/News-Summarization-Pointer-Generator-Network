Some 200,000 Americans want Justin Bieber deported after a week of run ins with the police, but the teenage pop star has at least one defender: beleaguered Toronto mayor Rob Ford.

Ford, a staple of late-night punch lines since he admitted in November to smoking crack cocaine while in a 'drunken stupor,' gave his support to Bieber Thursday during an interview on a Washington, D.C., radio show called The Sports Junkies.

'Well, you know what, he's a young guy,' said Ford, an avid football fan who is regular guest on the sports show. 'At 19 years old, I wish I was as successful as he was. He's 19 years old, guys. Think back to when you were 19.'

Ford made the comment after one of the hosts call Bieber 'Canada's worst export.'

Asked if he was a fan of Bieber's music, Ford said his tastes leaned more toward classic rock acts such as Led Zeppelin, the Rolling Stones, and the Eagles.

'I'm 45 years old, so there's a big difference here,' he said, adding that he hadn't met the teen either.

On Wednesday, a White House petition demanding the administration deport Bieber, who is in the U.S. on a temporary work visa, reached 100,000 signatures, the threshold to require a response from the White House.

By Thursday, more than double that number had signed the petition and a similar one on the White House website.

Bieber was charged Wednesday with 
assaulting a limousine driver in Toronto in December.

The singer's 
Canadian lawyer said in a statement that Bieber is not guilty.

Last
 week, Bieber was charged with driving under the influence in Miami 
after police say he was caught drag racing a rented Lamborghini.

Miami Beach police said Bieber told them he had taken a prescription medicine, smoked marijuana and consumed alcohol. Bieber has pleaded not guilty to those charges.

Ford, who is running for re-election as the mayor of Canada's largest city, also faced fresh controversy Wednesday after his sister's former boyfriend filed a lawsuit alleging Ford had conspired to have him threatened and beaten while in prison.

Asked about the lawsuit on the radio show, Ford declined to comment, saying the matter was before the courts.

Ford's lawyer said the allegations were false and irresponsible.

It was revealed Thursday that Justin Bieber tested positive for marijuana and prescription drugs after he was pulled over and arrested in his Lamborghini.

The wayward pop star had already 
allegedly told cops he had been smoking weed all day when he was stopped
 and thrown in jail overnight in Miami Beach on 23 January.

But the official toxicology report confirms that he had marijuana and the active ingredient of Xanax in his system.

The news comes as his father, apparently unconcerned by his son's recent behavior, tweeted a whimsical picture of Bieber tucked up in bed with his toddler brother this morning.

One of the White House petitions to deport Bieber reads: 'Nineteen years ago America was a place of serenity before our ears were tainted by Justin Bieber's abominable music and the images of him peeing in mop buckets and atop the snowcapped Colorado mountains.

'He has shown that he is incapable of contributing anything to our society other than stimulating the marijuana industry, single-handedly keeping the saggy hammer-pants trend alive, and giving Selena Gomez inspiration to write break-up songs.

'Taxpayers say NO MORE to footing the bill for his little jail slumber parties. Send him back to Canada, revoke his green card and his hair gel.'
