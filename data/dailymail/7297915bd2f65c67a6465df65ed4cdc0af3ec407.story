A former polygamist kicked out of the Fundamentalist Mormon church by 'prophet' Warren Jeffs is fighting in court for custody of his more than a dozen children.

Lorin Holm was excommunicated from the sect two years ago for being 'unfaithful' and shortly after sued for custody of his children by wives Lynda and Patricia.

Holm was one of the 7,500 members of the FLDS church settled in an area between southern Utah and northwestern Arizona. The members of this sect practice plural marriage, which the mainstream Mormon religion abandoned in 1890.

Holm still lives with first-wife Helen and their 12 children in Colorado City, Arizona, but his other two wives remained faithful to the sect and now share a new husband who happens to be imprisoned-leader Jeffs' nephew.

Suing for custody: Former polygamist Lorin Holm is fighting for custody of his children with former wives Lynda and Patricia Peine. His children were taken from him when he was kicked out of the Fundamentalist Mormon church in 2011

Woman of faith: Holm's former wife Lynda Peine (right) testified in court on Tuesday, saying she fears Holm is a bad influence on their children ever since he was excommunicated from the church

Protection: Holm fears his children will be the victims of sexual abuse, child labor or abandonment if they remain with two of his former wives

Holm is arguing that his children will be the victims of sexual abuse, child labor or abandonment if he isn't awarded sole custody.

Holm certainly isn't the first man to be kicked out of the FLDS church and kept from his family. In addition to gaining custody of all 25 of his children, Holm hopes this case will help other men in his position rescue their children from the grasps of the strict sect.

'There’s thousands of families, thousands of children that this will affect,' Holm told Fox 13. 'I want every father and every mother to have their children.'

Meanwhile, Lynda Peine told a judge Tuesday that she doesn't want her children to be around Holm, who she believes is a bad influence, as she fights to retain her custody rights.

Holm's attorney Roger Hoole grilled Peine about her religious beliefs, seeking to prove that her faith could come lead to dangerous parenting decisions.

'You’ve also testified that you understand marrying 12-year-olds or 13-year-olds is against the law,' Hoole said. 'If there is a conflict between the laws of God given by Warren Jeffs and the laws of the land, which is supreme in your mind? Which would you follow?'

'The laws of God,' Peine replied.

Hoole continued to ask her whether she believed it was OK for an adult male to have sex with an underage girl, as Jeffs preached.

'He never said that, in my hearing,' Peine said. 'I don't believe it.'

When Jeffs' sister was brought to the stand to testify about how she had been sexually abused by the prophet when she was just 14, Peine refused to listen - plugging her ears with her fingers.

Jeffs is currently serving a life sentence in Texas prison for  sexually assaulting two underage girls he called his 'brides' but he is still the de facto leader of the sect.

The prophet: Holm was kicked out of the church with an edict written by de facto leader Warren Jeffs who is currently serving a life sentence in prison. Jeffs recently returned to prison after being hospitalized earlier this month

It was while he was in jail that Holm was excommunicated, per his written edict.

Holm received the edict just as he was sitting down for Sunday dinner some three years ago and was told he needed to go to the church for a meeting.

At the church he was told he no longer belonged to his family and wasn't allowed to contact them, as they now belonged to Jeffs.

Jeffs nephew moved into Holm's 14-bedroom house, took over his business and was named the new husband and father to Holm's three wives and 25 children.

But Holm didn't follow the church's orders and returned to his home, where he got a cold welcome.

Church leaders informed the family that he was evil and that even talking to their dad would send them to hell. 

The future: Lorin and Helen Holm hope getting custody of the children will help other ex-fundamentalists in future custody cases

Eventually, his first-wife Helen left the church to be with him, bringing their 12 children, but his other two wives refused to betray Jeffs' orders.

In court on Wednesday, Lynda said that while she teaches her children to follow Jeffs' orders, she also tells them to respect Holm and she doesn't know why they call him an apostate.

Jeffs himself was called to testify in the custody case, but wasn't allowed to leave his prison in Texas to attend court.

Instead Holm's attorney visited Jeffs in prison where he collected a deposition. Hoole described Jeffs as looking 'gaunt, thin, and ashamed'.

'He looks at the ground when you ask him questions about his conduct,' Hoole said.

The judge in the custody case is still deciding whether Jeffs' deposition will be allowed in court. Hoole's meeting happened right before Jeffs was transferred to a hospital earlier this month for an illness.

True love: Holm shared a romantic picture of he and wife Helen on his Facebook page

It was announced today that Jeffs has been transferred back to prison after his extended stay at a Galveston medical facility.

Holm was allowed visitation every other weekend last year when he was interviewed for VICE.

While he showed reporters the home he used to share with his three wives, Holm talked about the kids' visits and how they would make pancakes, bounce balls, ride bikes and swim.

'The minute the door shuts they gotta go back across the Berlin wall and pray and read, and read and pray, and that's all they can do,' he said.

'Warren Jeffs isn't a prophet and never was one,' Holm added. 'Warren is not dad. Warren doesn't run my home. I'm the father of my home and God gave me this family. And I'm not going to have a thief take it.'

While custody is being decided, the judge has ordered that none of the minor children may marry without the court's consent.
