The boss of Microsoft's Windows division has left the company just two weeks after launching the flagship Windows 8 software and Surface tablet described as 'make or break' for the company.

23-year veteran Steven Sinofsky, head of Microsoft's Windows unit, was widely tipped to be the next 
chief executive of Microsoft Corp.

His 'shocking' departure is seen by many as an attempt by CEO Steve Ballmer to increase his control of the company as it faces increased competition from Apple and Google.

Steven Sinofsky launching the Windows 8 operating system in New York City two weeks ago. Today it was announced he is leaving the firm.

The Surface is Microsoft's first foray into computer hardware.

However, it has hit problems with 'modest' sales and users complaining or problems with the gadget's snap on keyboard.

Based on a Nvidia Corp chip designed by ARM 
Holdings, the Surface will run a simplified version of Windows 8 that is
not compatible with old Microsoft applications.

However,
the tablet will feature new app-style versions of Office mainstays such
as Word, PowerPoint and Excel, and will include Xbox games, video and 
music apps.

The Surface, with two cameras and a USB port, will be Wi-Fi only

The move was unexpected and neither Microsoft nor Sinofsky gave an explanation, although an executive at the company, who asked not to be named, said the decision was 'mutual' and said he was not expecting Sinofsky to take a job at another company soon.

'This is shocking news.

'This is very surprising,' said Brendan Barnicle, an analyst at Pacific Crest Securities.

'Like a lot of people, I thought Sinofsky was in line to potentially be Ballmer's successor.'

Sinofsky, 47, joined Microsoft in 1989 and made his mark as Bill Gates' technical assistant.

He grew into an uncompromising leader whose ruthless style of cutting layers of management and formalizing the process of software development gave rise to the term "Sinofskyization" in the company.

He wielded immense power as head of the Windows unit, the traditional center of Microsoft's business, but was not known for working well with other executives.

One former Microsoft employee who worked with Sinofsky and other executives said his relentlessly aggressive style exasperated other leaders and may have alienated too many people, including his mentor Gates.

'He had no one left to fight for him,' said the staffer, who asked not to be named.

'Gates gave him cover, so he must have eventually caved.'

It leaves Steve Ballmer, 56, shows no sign of leaving after almost 13 years in the job, despite almost constant criticism.

Sinofsky was also one of the team behind Microsoft's Surface tablet, which has only had 'modest' sales the firm has said

He has now replaced all the leaders of Microsoft's five main operating units in the past four years.

He told employees in a memo on Monday simply that: 'Steven Sinofsky has decided to leave the company.'

In a later media statement, he added that it was 'imperative that we continue to drive alignment across all Microsoft teams, and have more integrated and rapid development cycles for our offerings'.

'Windows has to be much more thoroughly integrated with Xbox, with other parts of the company,' said Barnicle. 'I don't know that was something Steven was as excited about as focusing on Windows.'

Sinofsky had a stellar career at Microsoft, overhauling the hugely profitable Office division before going over to manage the release of Windows 7 in 2009.

That was regarded as a success and Sinofsky was then tasked with overseeing Windows 8, Microsoft's new-look, touch-friendly operating system designed to bridge the gap with mobile computing leaders Apple and Google.

Silicon Valley may have a stereotype 
as the land of computer nerds and alpha males, but the modern technology
boss is increasingly likely to be a woman.

Now
the likes of Facebook's Sheryl Sandberg and Marissa Mayer, CEO of Yahoo
have been joined by Julie Larson-Green, the new president of Windows 
who is just the latest female tech maven to step in to a high-profile 
role.

Microsoft said on Monday that it has 
promoted company veteran Ms Larson-Green to lead all its Windows 
software and hardware engineering.

Tech Titan: In 2008, Sheryl Sandberg became COO at Facebook and is now the first woman on the company's board of directors.

Tami Reller will take over 
responsibility for the Windows business, while retaining her posts as 
chief financial officer and chief marketing officer.

Since 1993, Ms Larson-Green has worked on and led some of the most 
successful products for Microsoft, including the user experiences for 
early versions of Internet Explorer, and helped drive the thinking 
behind the refresh of the user experience for Microsoft Office.

For 
Windows 7 and Windows 8 she was responsible for program management, user
interface design and research, as well as development of all 
international releases.

She has a master's degree in software 
engineering from Seattle University and a bachelor's degree in business 
administration from Western Washington University, according to CNET.

In her new role she 
will be responsible for all future Windows product development in 
addition to future hardware opportunities.

Ms
Larson-Green is the latest woman to ascend the largely male-dominated 
tech industry.

Melissa Mayer was appointed CEO of Yahoo in July.

At the same time, Sinofsky led the development of Microsoft's Surface tablet, its first own-brand computer, aimed at tackling Apple's wildly successful iPad head on.

Analysts said it may be too early to judge whether Windows 8 and the Surface have been a success, after launching on Oct. 26, but Sinofsky's departure could have been tied to his abrasive management and ambition for the top job.

From Windows 8 to Outlook.com to Windows Phone 8, Sinofsky has worked across all aspects of

He joined the Windows team after the Vista operating system debuted and headed up the development of Windows 7 and then Windows 8.

'We started to look back and we said, ‘Wow, the user interface, the experience, the form factors, the kinds of PCs were all developed in the mid 1990s,'' Sinofsky said last month in an interview with ABC News.

'We looked and we said, ‘Things are so different. We need to envision a new kind of software for those scenarios, because the world is a different place.’'

'It sounded like it had more to do with his leadership style,' said Barnicle at Pacific Crest. 'There wasn't really a next move for Steven at this point.'

Sinofsky said: 'It is impossible to count the blessings I have received over my years at Microsoft,' he said in a statement. "I am humbled by the professionalism and generosity of everyone I have had the good fortune to work with at this awesome company.'

Sinofsky will be succeeded by Julie Larson-Green, who will head the Windows hardware and software division, and Tami Reller, who will remain chief financial officer of the Windows unit.

Together, they will report directly to Ballmer.

Sinofsky's departure comes two weeks after rival Apple shook up its own top management, forcing out mobile head Scott Forstall and retail chief John Browett.

One analyst cited talk that the moves might be related.

'Some are speculating that the availability on the market of Forstall might have something to do with Sinofsky's departure,' said Gartner analyst Carolina Milanesi.

'I doubt we will have to wait long to know if this is the case.'
