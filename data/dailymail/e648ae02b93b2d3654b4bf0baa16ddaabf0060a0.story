More than 30 years after Jerry Hartfield's murder conviction was overturned he still sits in a Texas prison because two courts can't agree on what to do with him.

A federal appeals court claims the 56-year-old is being illegally held since his conviction was overturned in 1983 and ordered a retrial, but the state argues otherwise, leaving both unsure what to do with his case.

This spat between the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals and state attorney general's office promises without found agreement a new series of legal proceedings potentially dragged out even longer before he could finally face trial.

He’s 'stuck,' according to his federal public defender, with Hartfield arguing his constitutional right to a speedy trial have been violated with the state failing to retry him while also not setting him free.

'It's one of those one-in-a-million deals,' Kenneth R Hawk II said of his client's imprisonment. 'When you see it, it's kind of breath taking.'

Hartfield was 21 when he was convicted in the gruesome 1976 slaying of a 55-year-old ticket agent at a bus station in Bay City.

Waiting: After Hartfield's conviction was overturned, ordering a retrial in 1980, he's sat in a Texas federal prison waiting for that date which has still not come

Hartfield was convicted and sentenced to die, but in 1980, a Texas appeals court ordered a new trial, saying a potential juror had been wrongly excluded from the original trial because of her reservations about imposing the death penalty.

Naming a previous case as an example of Hartfield's situation, his appeal states that the order for retrial 'only affected the sentence and not the determination of guilty. Nonetheless, Texas law at that time required an entirely new trial in such circumstances.'

Eleven days later, then Gov. Mark White 
commuted Hartfield's death sentence to life in prison. At that point, 
both sides let the case lie for about 20 years.

On Wednesday a federal appeals court 
sent his case back to the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals asking they 
define the status of its ruling overturning Hartfield’s conviction.

If
the Texas appeals court accepts the federal appeals court's request, it
could set off a new series of legal proceedings that ties up the 
attorney general's office and drags out the case.

State attorneys twice requested a rehearing on the appeals court’s decision, with the court rejecting their second request on March 4, 1983.

Hartfield, described in court documents as illiterate and mentally impaired with an IQ of 51, got the ball rolling again in 2006, when he filed a handwritten writ of habeas corpus with the help of another inmate. The writ essentially said he should be retried or set free.

It was rejected twice by the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals before Hartfield submitted it in the federal court system.

A judge there agreed with him.

'Hartfield's position is as straightforward and subtle as a freight train,' U.S. District Judge Lynn Hughes said.

The state had claimed that Hartfield was legally serving the life sentence ordered by White. It said he had had one year under federal rules to file an appeal on any aspect of his case, and that year started when the retrial was ordered in 1983.

Hughes disagreed, saying the clock on an appeal doesn't start until there's a conviction, and none exists in this case.

'The court's mandate was never recalled, its decision never overturned, the conviction never reinstated; yet Hartfield never received the `entirely new trial' ordered by the court,' he wrote.

The state's appeal of Hughes' decision eventually ended up before a three-judge panel of the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, which described the state's defense of Hartfield's incarceration as 'disturbingly unprofessional' in its Wednesday decision.

The panel had said in October that it couldn't make a formal decision on Hartfield's complaint that his constitutional right to a speedy trial has been violated because the issue hadn't been resolved yet by his state trial court in Wharton County, about 60 miles southwest of Houston.

But the federal appeals judges left little doubt about their position, saying the state appeals court reversal 30 years ago meant 'there was no longer a death sentence to commute, and thus the governor's order could not have had any effect.'

The state's request for a rehearing on that decision led to Wednesday's ruling.

Hartfield, who is originally from Wichita, Kan., has been moved to a Texas prison hospital for an undisclosed illness and was not available for an interview.

Hawk said he'd discussed the court activity with Hartfield but found it useless to write him.

'Because he can't read it,' he said.
