Cyber thieves hacked into the accounts of more than 1,000 StubHub customers and fraudulently bought tickets for events.

Online criminals obtained the login details and passwords from users around the world in a scam believed to be part of an international cyber fraud ring.

An international investigation involving the City of London Police, U.S. Secret Service and Canadian Mounted Police uncovered the illicit operation and arrests are expected to be announced today during a press conference hosted by Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance.

Online scam: The login details and passwords of StubHub customers from around the world are said to have been hacked 

The San Francisco-based company insist the thieves didn't break through its security — rather, they got account-holders' information from data breaches at other websites.

The company detected the unauthorized transactions last year, contacted authorities and gave the affected customers refunds and help changing their passwords.

StubHub's head of global communications, Glenn Lehrman, said he could not reveal how much money was involved or how many people were being charged.

Fraudulent charges were posted after hackers obtained user credentials by hacking into other sites, then used them to log in StubHub, he said.

'We did not have anyone who hacked into our system,' Lehrman said.

He said the schemes involved a 'pretty intense network of cyber fraudsters working in concert with each other.'

It's unclear whether the digital prowlers then exploited their access to scoop up more information from the compromised accounts. The company and the law enforcement official wouldn't give further details Tuesday.

StubHub, owned by eBay, is the leading digital marketplace for reselling concert, sports, theater and other tickets, offering brokers and fans a way 'to buy or sell their tickets in a safe, convenient and highly reliable environment,' as its website pledges. 

In the last year, major companies such as Target, LinkedIn, eBay and Neiman Marcus have been hacked. 

Target, the nation's second-largest discounter, acknowledged in December that data connected to about 40 million credit and debit card accounts was stolen as part of a breach that began over the Thanksgiving weekend. 

Even Goodwill Industries Inc. found itself announcing last month that shoppers' payment card data might have been stolen.

Ticket-sellers also have been targeted. The event ticketing service Vendini last month settled a class action lawsuit related to a data breach in 2013. 

Authorities generally advise consumers to protect against possible identity theft from such breaches by keeping close watch on their bank statements and using credit card monitoring services, among other tips.
