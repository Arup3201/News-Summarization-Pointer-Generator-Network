Thugs: Margiris Jogela and an accomplice stole the intoxicated victim's wallet and mobile phone

A mugger caught after police followed his footprints in the snow struck just two days after arriving from Lithuania to start a new life.

Margiris Jogela, 22, sneaked up on a student as he tried to unlock his bike at 4am after a drinking session.

The victim was clouted on the head and punched, ending up on the ground.

With an accomplice, Jogela then stole his wallet, mobile phone and cash before running off.

But they were spotted by a CCTV operator who alerted police and two officers were able to follow their trail.

Jogela’s shoes matched the snow prints and he was arrested.

Yesterday he was jailed for 32 months after admitting the robbery in Norwich last month.

However, the second man escaped, the city’s crown court heard.

Judge Peter Jacobs, who was shown footage of the attack on the University of East Anglia student, said it was a ‘serious and frightening’ offence which the men had obviously planned.

He told Jogela: ‘You were caught almost red-handed because it was possible to follow the footprints.’

The judge added that committing the crime so soon after coming to Britain showed his presence was ‘totally undesirable’.

But, he said, there was ‘nothing he could do about that’.

'It's a serious matter - you've used force of sufficient nature to put him to the floor.

'There was obviously some pre-planning.'

He added: 'You targeted a vulnerable victim, you were involved with one other person and the offence was committed at night.'

Big mistake: Jogela, 22, was captured on CCTV and officers then traced his footprints in the snow

On the trail: One set of footprints matched the Lithuanian's shoes. His accomplice was never caught

Jailing him for 32 months, a judge said Jogela's presence in the UK was 'totally undesirable'

Chris Youell, prosecuting, showed the judge CCTV footage of the vicious attack.

Mr Youell said: 'It did prove useful for police in the end as they were able to follow some footprints.'

He said that after sneaking up behind their target and 'clouting him towards the back of the head', Jogela and his friend rifled through the youth's pockets and took his UEA student card.

The drama was followed by the city's CCTV operator before two police officers trailed 'fresh footprints in the fresh snow' and caught Jogela.

Violent: The student was hit on the head while trying to unlock his bike in the city, Norwich Crown Court heard

Target: The University of East Anglia student was said to have been drunk when he was attacked in the city

Mr Youell said his shoes matched the prints and he was arrested.

He said that if they had been able to catch the second thug he would have been 'in the dock' with Jogela.

Ian James, defending, said Jogela, who had been staying in Norwich with friends, 'could not shed any light on the offence at all'.

Mr James told the court: 'He tells me that he doesn't have any problem with drugs or alcohol or health problems.'
