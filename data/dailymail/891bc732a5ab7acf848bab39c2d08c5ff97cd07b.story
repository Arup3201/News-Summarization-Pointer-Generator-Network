Maha Qidwai is still haunted by the image of her murdered mother Shahnaz's battered, bruised body on the floor of their Sydney waterfront home.

Tony Halloun, 36, sat motionless in the dock as Maha, her father, her brother and her two sisters, one after the other broke down as they detailed how the loss of their family's 'angel' on June 15, 2012 had changed their lives.

'I came home and found my mother lying lifeless on the floor - bruised, battered and beaten. She was dead,' Maha, 28, told Halloun's sentence hearing on Friday.

'It is this last horrific image of my mother that I remember and carry with me every single second of my life.'

Dr Khalid Qidwai cried as he described the enormous 'loneliness and sadness' he feels at the loss of his wife of more than 45 years in such violent circumstances.

'She was the love of my life ...my best friend and my world.

'She was the link that bonded our family. Even after two-and-a-half years we are still not able to accept the fact that she is not with us. Now every one of us is crying, sometimes together, sometimes alone,' he said.

The Qidwai family told the NSW Supreme Court of the heartache over the death of their 'angel'

It took just two hours for the Supreme Court jury in September to unanimously find the tradesman guilty of murdering Shahnaz Qidwai in her Sydney mansion in June 2012.

Halloun, who had been concreting the driveway of the Henley property at the time of her death, told police three versions of events of what happened that day.

In one, he alleged masked intruders stormed the lavish house where he had been working and that the last time he saw her she had a gun pointed to a head.

The court has previously heard the financially-strapped Halloun went into the home and killed Mrs Qidwai, stealing more than $3000 from the family home.

Justice Lucy McCallum said on Friday that it was difficult for her to make any finding of what really happened in the house that day as Halloun continued to profess his innocence.

Crown prosecutor Giles Tabuteau, however, submitted that Halloun had an intention to kill Mrs Qidwai because after the 'sustained attack' he stayed at the property for half and hour and didn't call Triple '0'.

Halloun will be sentenced on December 5.
