Pictures of Paolo Di Canio's elaborate fascist tattoo have emerged on the day he takes charge of Sunderland for the first time.

The design features an imperial eagle holding the fasces, the original symbol of fascism in Italy under Benito Mussolini.

Although the tattoo was completed it 2004, the pictures will raise eyebrows as it comes just days after he denounced fascism.

Paolo Di Canio has a large tattoo of the notorious fascist symbols of the imperial eagle and fasces, which were adopted by the Italian Fascist movement and later the Nazi party. The tattoo also features a portrait of Benito Mussolini in a military helmet

Di Canio will take charge of his first match as Sunderland manager today when his side face Chelsea at Stamford Bridge.

He was forced to distance himself from the ideology last week after the Dean of Durham released an emotional open-letter saying his appointment as the Black Cats boss 'raises very difficult questions'.

But despite saying he is not a political person, Di Canio wrote in his autobiography how his tattoo was done by two ultra-right Lazio supporters.

The tattoo design also features a portrait of Mussolini wearing a military helmet.

The imperial eagle was adopted by the Nazi party and used in combination with the swastika on the orders of Adolf Hitler.

The Italian Fascist Blackshirts wore uniform with the fasces or an eagle clutching a fasces on their caps or left arms.

Di Canio has a separate tattoo of DVX on his arm, a tribute to the fascist leader who was known as Il Duce.

In his book, The Return, Di Canio said the designs 'clearly show my political faith.'

However, Di Canio released a statement last week in which he said he is not 'political'.

The Italian wrote: 'I have clearly stated that I
do not wish to speak about matters other than football; however, I have
been deeply hurt by the attacks on the football club.

'This is a historic, proud and 
ethical club and to read and to hear some of the vicious and personal 
accusations is painful. I am an honest man, my values and principles 
come from my family and my upbringing.

'I feel that I should not have to 
continually justify myself to people who do not understand this, however
I will say one thing only - I am not the man that some people like to 
portray.

'I am not political, I do not 
affiliate myself to any organisation, I am not a racist and I do not 
support the ideology of fascism. I respect everyone.

'I am a football man and this and my family are my focus. Now I will speak only of football.'

His stance surprised sports journalist Elisabetta Esposito, who co-wrote his autobiography.

She
told The Sunday Times: 'Maybe he wants people to stop talking about his
politics, or maybe he's changed his opinions. It's incredible'.

Friend Gabriele Bordoni said Di Canio and Signorelli shared common 'ways of seeing the world'

His brother Antonio was quoted today as denying Di Canio was racist but refusing to speak about his links to fascism.

He told The Sunday Times: 'It's better if we don't talk about that. He is suffering because of this.'

Di Canio has previously attended the funeral of notorious fascist and Italian Socialist member Paolo Signorelli.

The extreme-right activist was held in prison on remand for eight years over a terrorist bombing which killed 85 people in 1980.

Their friend, lawyer Gabriele Bordoni told The Sunday Times that the pair shared common 'ways of seeing the world' but denied Di Canio was racist.

He said: 'Paolo can say whether he's a fascist of not, but racist, no.'
