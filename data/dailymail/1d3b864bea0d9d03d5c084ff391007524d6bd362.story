The ticket wartime Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain used on his symbolic trip to secure peace with Adolf Hitler has emerged for sale at £15,000.

Chamberlain waved the ticket as he boarded the British Airways flight from Heston Aerodrome in London to Munich on September 29, 1938.

The aim of the trip was to hold crisis talks with the Fuhrer following Germany’s invasion of Czechoslovakia.

Fearing war, Chamberlain agreed to allow Hitler’s occupation of part of the country in return for the assurance that peace and stability in Europe would continue.

'Peace in our time': The ticket Neville Chamberlain used to board a plane to Munich for a meeting with Hitler in 1938 is expected to fetch £15,000 at an auction later this month

Symbolic: The wartime leader waved the Anglo-German declaration on his return from the crisis talks. But just a year later he was forced to announce that Britain was at war following Germany's invasion of Poland

Along with Italian fascist leader Benito Mussolini and French Prime Minister Edouard Daladier, Chamberlain and Hitler signed a pact that became known as the Munich Agreement.

On his return to Britain the following day, Chamberlain triumphantly declared that war had been averted and he had secured 'peace for our time'.

As he waved the Anglo-German declaration above his head, he told reporters waiting on the runway that the pact was 'symbolic of the desire of our two peoples never to go to war with one another again.'

But just a year later he was forced to make the embarrassing announcement that Britain was at war with Germany following Hitler’s continued invasion of Poland.

The reaction set the grounds for Chamberlain’s political demise and by May 1940 he had been replaced by Winston Churchill as Prime Minister.

The paper ticket carried the number BA/WS 18249 and under 'passenger name' is written 'The Rt Hon Neville Chamberlain'.

It notes that he left from Heston Aerodrome  and in the box marked 'Fare' it is written 'Special Flight'.

Historic: Chamberlain, pictured boarding the plane on September 29 1938,  met with the Fuhrer alongside Italian fascist leader Benito Mussolini and French Prime Minister Edouard Daladier in a bid to secure peace in Europe

Support: A crowd of supporters and reporters gathered at the Heston Aerodrome to see the Prime Minister off 

Farewell: Chamberlain embarks on the crucial journey to Germany 

After the flight it was saved by British Airways founder George Denny and was found among his possessions following his death.

It is believed he kept the ticket as a souvenir as he would have appreciated the historic importance of the flight.

The ticket is tipped to fetch £15,000 when it goes under the hammer at London auction house Spink and Son on behalf of a private collector.

It is only the second time the ticket has been offered at auction. 

Neill Granger, a specialist at Spink, said: 'This plane ticket is quite exceptional.

'Neville Chamberlain’s visit to Munich in 1938 was an iconic moment in history. He thought he had solved the problem of Hitler and returned triumphant.

'But famously things didn’t turn out the way Chamberlain expected and a year later we were at war with Germany.

'What Chamberlain had intended to be a landmark moment ended up being one of the nails in his political coffin.

'The flight ticket was issued on September 28, 1938, the day before the flight.

'It was found among the personal possessions of George Denny, one of the founders of British Airways.

'Normally these tickets were thrown away but he obviously decided this one was one to keep.

'It is one of those items that if two people decide they want it could see bidding go far beyond our estimate.'

The auction will be held on July 18.
