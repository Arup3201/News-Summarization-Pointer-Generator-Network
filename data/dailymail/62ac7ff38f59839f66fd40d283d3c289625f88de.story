The first two seasons of British period drama 'Downton Abbey' have taken U.S. audiences by storm, and plans are now in place for America to receive a period drama of its own.

And now, just six weeks out from series three, NBC has signed its Oscar-winning creator, Julian Fellowes, to come up with a show based on America's past.

Set in late 19th century New York City, 'The Gilded Age' will follow the lives of 'the princes of the American Renaissance, and the vast fortunes they made - and spent.'

The new television drama will be produced by the NBC Universal television studio and could be on the air as early as Fall 2013.

'This was a vivid time with dizzying, brilliant ascents and calamitous falls, of record-breaking ostentation and savage rivalry,' Mr Fellowes said in a statement.

'(It was) a time when money was king.'

The Gilded Age in New York was marked by the rise of industry, invention and transportation.

The era was personified in bankers J.P. Morgan, Andrew Carnegie, John D. Rockefeller and Cornelius Vanderbilt.

They were the business pioneers who became America's first millionaires after founding steel, oil and finance.

As lavish mansions sprung up along 
Fifth Avenue, the Gilded Age was also the time when the Astor family 
rose to prominence, eventually becoming 'the landlords of New York.'

The famed Waldorf-Astoria hotel, 
Manhattanâ€™s Astor Place and the Astoria neighborhood of Queens are just a
 few of the locations that continue to carry the Astor name.

Success: The commercial and critical success of 'Downton Abbey,' pictured, has been huge since it first graced U.S. screens two years ago

Soap: A glorified soap, 'Downton Abbey' follows the aristocratic Crawley family; their romances, tragedies and endless struggles of the manor's many servants

NBC reportedly passed up 'Downton Abbey' at the start, believing the costume 
drama wouldn't appeal to American viewers.

The commercial and critical success of 'Downton Abbey' has been huge since it graced U.S. screens two years ago.

Winner: Mr Fellowes , pictured at the Emmys, has won scores of awards for his show 'Downton Abbey'

It has won six Emmy awards, including two for Fellowes and two for Dame Maggie Smith, who plays Violet Crawley, Dowager Countess of Grantham.

According to the New York Post, the show's second season was the most watched series ever with its February 5, 2012 episode rated No. 2 at 9pm behind the Super Bowl.

The program has been sent up on 'Saturday Night Live' and by late night host Jimmy Fallon as well as inspiring scores of YouTube videos.

Mr Fellowes will continue working on 'Downton Abbey,' which has been renewed for a fourth season.

In United States history, the Gilded Age was the period following the Civil War, running from 1877 to 1893 when the next era began, the Progressive Era.

The term was coined by writers Mark Twain and Charles Dudley Warner in The Gilded Age: A Tale of Today, satirizing what they believed to be an era of serious social problems hidden by a thin layer of gold.

The Gilded Age was a time of enormous growth as the United States jumped to the lead in industrialisation ahead of Britain.

The economic boom attracted millions from Europe. Railroads were the major industry, but the factory system, coal mining, and labor unions also gained in importance.

During the 1870s and 1880s, the U.S. economy rose at the fastest rate in its history, with real wages, wealth, GDP, and capital formation all increasing rapidly.

Capitalizing on the economic boom were America's first millionaires like J.P. Morgan, John D. Rockefeller, Cornelius Vanderbilt - now regarded as the first success stories in the steel, oil and finance industries.

And they weren't the only flourishing industries.

Between 1865 and 1898, the output of wheat increased by 256 per cent, corn by 222 per cent, coal by 800 per cent and miles of railway track by 567 per cent.

The growth was interrupted by a major nationwide depression known as the Panic of 1893.
