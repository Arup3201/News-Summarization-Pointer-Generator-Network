A Texas hunting club has canceled plans to auction off a chance to kill an African elephant, the club's executive director said Saturday.

Ben Carter of the Dallas Safari Club told The Associated Press, that the donor of the hunt withdrew his donation.

The African elephant is the Earth's largest land animal. The World Wildlife Fund, the world's leading conservation group, regards it as 'vulnerable,' a step below 'endangered' and defined as 'facing a high risk of extinction in the wild.'

A Texas hunting club has canceled plans to auction off a chance to kill an African elephant, the club's executive director said Saturday

The Dallas Safari Club faced international criticism last year for auctioning a permit to shoot an endangered black rhino. 

That hunt has been postponed until the winner receives permission to import the carcass from Namibia.

This year's auction prizes still include a 14-day trophy hunt in Mozambique for an adult male leopard.

Animal welfare activists demonstrated across the street from the Dallas hotel where the club's convention was taking place.

Angela Antonisse-Oxley of the Dallas-based Black Rhino Project, said trophy hunts aggravate the serious problem of big game poaching in Africa.

'A bullet is not going to save them,' she said.

In an earlier statement, Carter said that "elephants, lions and leopards are not listed as endangered species by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and, in fact, are overpopulated in certain areas of Africa."

'These species are commonly hunted where legal, sustainable and where populations need to be managed,' the statement said.

This is not the first time the club has drawn controversy.  

In 2014, Corey Knowlton paid $350,000 at a January auction held by the Dallas Safari Club for a permit to hunt a black rhinoceros in Namibia -- a species listed as critically endangered, according to CBS News. 

Knowlton applied for a permit from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service last Spring that would allow him to import the body of the endangered animal from Namibia after his hunt. The agency has yet to give him an answer.

The Club billed the auction as a fundraising effort to to save the endangered species but the agency is applying extra scrutiny to Knowlton's request because of the rise in poaching CBS reports, and the agency is evaluating whether the hunt will result in enhancement of the species's survival.

'I'm a hunter,' Knowlton said. 'I want to experience a black rhino. I want to be intimately involved with a black rhino.'
