Sir George Christie took a massive gamble when he decided knock down his father's opera house and build a state-of-the-art facility

You may think that going to the opera at Glyndebourne is a relic from the days of Downton Abbey — an activity restricted to crumbling dukes in dinner jackets getting stuck into the champagne in between arias.

It’s true that it’s expensive — £110 for the cheaper tickets to one of Mozart’s greatest operas, Don Giovanni, being performed this summer. But you could pay the same to watch a Premier League game or see the Rolling Stones in concert. So you have to view the cost in context.

For the price of a ticket, you get the best music in the world, in one of the world’s greatest opera houses, and all in a beautifully unspoilt fold of the South Downs. And the black tie is optional.

The unique feel of Glyndebourne is largely thanks to Sir George Christie, the man who took his father’s charming little theatre and turned it into an international opera house — and a fixture of the English summer season.

On paper Sir George, who died earlier this week at 79, looked pretty unremarkable. Educated at Eton and Trinity College, Cambridge, he inherited the manor house at Glyndebourne from his father, John Christie.

John was a World War I veteran, a former master at Eton and a Companion of Honour like his son — an unprecedented double.

The house, a charming mishmash of Tudor, 17th century, Victorian and early 20th century styles, has been in the family since the early 17th century. The Christies can trace their lineage right back to Lady Godiva, the scantily dressed Anglo-Saxon noblewoman.

But in truth, Sir George was far from unremarkable. When you met him, the first thing that struck you was his size — only 5ft   2ins. His character, too — jolly, friendly, anarchic — was far removed from the stuffy clichés that cling to the opera world.

He shared the family passion for pugs — he was even said to have been named after a favourite family pet — and the artists’ pub at Glyndebourne is called the Pug and Whistle. When I met him a decade ago, at a summer party by the sea in Sandwich, he was wearing a sailor’s hat at a jaunty angle, a bright-pink shirt and a smile as broad as the English Channel. But where he displayed the greatest radicalism was in the revolution he plotted for the family opera house.

Like a lot of seemingly ancient British traditions, Glyndebourne opera isn’t really that old. John Christie came up with the idea in 1934 (one of many sadnesses of Sir George’s death is that he didn’t get to see the opening of the 80th anniversary season on May 17).

John built his little theatre as an indulgence for his wife, a soprano called Audrey Mildmay. To begin with it sat 300 people. As it became more popular, it mushroomed: from 433 in 1936 to 600 in 1952.

When Sir George inherited Glyndebourne in 1962, at only 27, the place was still expanding. In 1977 its capacity increased to 850 people. He had to face financial reality — his father had run the opera house at a loss out of his own fortune; the son couldn’t afford such indulgence. Something had to give.

For all Glyndebourne’s charm, this gradual, haphazard growth meant the old theatre was, to be honest, a bit of a dog’s dinner — a village hall with a crazy amount of extensions. Things were done on the hoof, literally — stables became offices; garages became rehearsal rooms; outbuildings became scene docks.

And so, in 1987, Sir George took the biggest gamble of his life. He decided to knock down his father’s amateurish pride of joy and replace it with a state-of-the-art opera house that would rank with the great opera houses of the world.

Traditionalists were outraged —both at the demolition of John Christie’s old-fashioned theatre, and the construction of a daring design by husband-and-wife architects Michael and Patty Hopkins.

In fact, the new opera house carefully bridged the gap between the old and new — as Sir George did. Like the manor house, it was built of brick, but was wrapped in copper, and the huge new metal fly tower soared over the mock-Elizabethan windows of the old house.

Even the sceptics were bowled over, and it was soon listed as one of the most important Grade I buildings of the Nineties. Sir George drove a hard bargain, too. For £33 million, he got an opera house built in only seven years that some say should have cost £50 million.

The capacity was 1,200. But still, the operas played to full houses. And when it came to money, Sir George conducted a careful balancing act. He realised that the new commercial world meant sponsorship and corporate entertainment were crucial sources of support. He also understood that good opera cost big money. He had the honesty to admit that the best opera ‘is always going to be elitist: there’s no point pretending anything else’.

Admittedly, the corporate types are in evidence at Glyndebourne — sometimes more interested in being seen than in seeing the opera. But 30 per cent of the seats are retained for the public, and there are special deals if you sign up as an Associate Member.

The days 
when opera-goers brought their butlers are long gone. And young visitors
 are encouraged — I first went in my early 20s as a broke student, when I
 didn’t know a thing about opera, and fell in love with the place on the
 spot.

Today,
 under-30s can get tickets for £30. And Glyndebourne operas are beamed 
live on the internet and into cinemas across the country.

You
 can be a Hooked On Classics kind of fan like me — whose tastes don’t 
stretch much beyond Mozart and Verdi — or you can be a top-of-the-tree 
classical music aficionado.

This
 year’s Glyndebourne season includes the great crowd-pleaser La Traviata
 by Verdi, and the more obscure Rinaldo by Handel. Sir George always 
took risks with the programme — in 1990, a modernist version of Mozart’s
 The Magic Flute was the first opera to be booed at Glyndebourne.

Controversies
 have continued in recent years. In 2007, Glyndebourne applied for a 
70m-high wind turbine. It was so controversial in an area of outstanding
 national beauty that the Government put planning permission on hold, 
before allowing the scheme in 2008.

Despite
 embracing modernity, Sir George retained his father’s dress code. But 
it was, in the words of the code, ‘customary’ not obligatory. No one 
stops you going in if you’re not in the full gear.

Over the 20 years I’ve been going to Glyndebourne, I’ve worn some pretty ropy versions of black tie —particularly when I’ve just cycled four miles from Lewes Railway Station, my shirt dripping with sweat, my tatty old dinner jacket squashed into a plastic bag. And no one’s said a word or raised a disapproving eyebrow as I get changed in the car park.

Like most of the best British events, Glyndebourne is a glorious mix of the shabbily amateur and the slickly professional.

Yes, you can spend a fortune at the bar on overpriced champagne and upmarket food. But most Glyndebourne regulars come with their own homemade picnics — from a ham roll and a packet of cheese-and-onion crisps, to heaving baskets crammed with lobster and foie gras.

You can eat what you want to eat, drink what you want to drink — again free from any stuffy restrictions or anything as wicked as a corkage charge. You can dine off china on a fold-up table or, as I’ve done, lie in the long grass by the lake, dip one hand in the water and wrap the other around a plastic tumbler of warm white wine.

Formal but relaxed, classic but modern, international but thoroughly English. You could say the same of Glyndebourne and its late, much lamented impresario.
