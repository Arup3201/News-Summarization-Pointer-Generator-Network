Triple police killer Harry Roberts has been enjoying his new life of freedom with a new identity and a state-funded bungalow.

The 78-year-old, who was jailed for life for shooting dead three unarmed officers in 1966, was released on licence from Littlehey Prison, Cambridgeshire, in November last year.

After serving 48 years behind bars, the murderer has reportedly taken his new found freedom in his stride - getting the bus to the supermarket, walking in the park and visiting the gym daily.

The pensioner has to check in with authorities twice a day but is otherwise free to come and go as he pleases, The Sun reports.

He has been seen out and about wearing a pair of sunglasses and using his pension to buy bacon and tinned peaches.

A local who recognised him told the paper: 'Nobody has a clue who he is - but he looks like the cat who got the cream.

'He is wandering around completely unchecked, joking with locals who would be horrified if they knew his real identity.'

They also claim that his three neighbours at the bungalow - where he has his own living area - have no idea who he is.

Harry Fletcher, a former senior official in the probation officers’ union NAPO, said it costs taxpayers about £25,000 a year to keep Roberts at the hostel, which is staffed 24 hours a day.

He is also entitled to draw the basic state pension – £113 per week – taking the overall bill to the taxpayer to around £31,000.

Mr Fletcher said: 'Because of his notoriety, risk and age, they have put him in an "approved premise" - pretty much a bail hostel.

'He wasn't deemed a risk to the public or to himself but the risk is that people in the community would recognise him, although that risk was deemed low as he hasn't really been photographed recently.

'However given these recent revelations the chances are he will now have to be moved to another accommodation.'

He explained that the typical stay in one of these hostels is between three and six months and after that the authorities would ensure he gets another form of sheltered accommodation.

'During the day he will be unrestricted. He will be subject to some form of curfew - probably about 9pm and then he will stay in the hostel until around 7ish the next morning.

'He will report to the probation service weekly and there will be staff in the hostel he will see daily. If he is deemed to be coping okay this will be reduced to fortnightly and then monthly. He is on a life licence so he will need to do that for the rest of his life.'

He added: 'Someone that has been in prison that long will be institutionalised and so they would have considered keeping him in an open prison but as he didn't pose a risk to the public he was put in a bail hostel.' 

Roberts was jailed for life for the murders of Det Sgt Christopher Head, 30, Det Con David Wombwell, 25, and PC Geoffrey Fox, 41, in West London in 1966. 

Despite the heinous nature of his crime, for which he has never expressed any remorse, Roberts was allowed out on temporary release back in 2001. 

Roberts had lost his bid to be granted parole in 2009 after he threatened and intimidated Joan Cartwright, her husband Peter and her son James, who had given Roberts work at their animal sanctuary while he was on day release.

He had threatened to kill the couple after she complained about his behaviour, and he rang her from prison up to five times a week after learning she had given evidence against him.

Several attacks were also carried out on her animals at the East Midlands sanctuary. 

Before their relationship broke down in July 2001, around his 65th birthday, staff at the sanctuary arranged a secret birthday party and even arranged for a birthday cake and champagne.

Roberts, Duddy and Witney were sitting in a van near Wormwood Scrubs prison on August 12, 1966, planning an armed robbery with a Luger pistol.

They were approached by the three plain clothes unarmed police officers who had suspected there had been a jail escape.

Roberts shot at the policemen in Braybrook Street while children were playing nearby.

He killed Det Con Wombell and chased and shot Sergeant Head.

One of his accomplices then shot Geoffrey Fox.

Roberts went on the run for three months and when he was caught he was sentenced to life in prison.

His two accomplices are now both dead. Duddy died in Parkhurst prison in 1981 and Witney was released in 1991 but was beaten to death with a hammer by his flatmate in Bristol in 1999. 

He also received presents of aftershave and socks reportedly made a toast saying 'Here's to freedom... I cannot believe the Home Secretary let me out'.

Around that time he was also treated to a night out 10-pin bowling at the Hollywood Bowl centre in Chesterfield, Derbyshire. 

Mrs Cartwright, 71, is said to be 'sickened' by the revelations.  

Roberts was found guilty of three murders after a trial for what the judge described as 'the most heinous crime for a generation or more'.

He had been sitting with his accomplices John Duddy and John Witney in a van near Wormwood Scrubs prison in West London.

The trio had been preparing for an armed robbery when they were approached by the officers and Roberts opened fire with a Luger pistol on the three unarmed officers.

Roberts shot dead two of the policemen, DS Head and DC Wombwell, and DC Fox was killed by Duddy. 

His accomplices were caught but Roberts, then 30, remained on the run for 96 days relying on his training as a soldier to survive. His disappearance sparked Scotland Yard's biggest ever manhunt.

He was later found near Bishop's Stortford, Hertfordshire, living in a camouflaged den made out of plastic bags and branches.

On November 15, 1966, Roberts was given three life sentences with a 30 year minimum tariff. He went on to become on of Britain's longest serving prisoners.
