The mother of murdered teenager Stephen Lawrence has been named the most powerful woman in the country in a list compiled for Radio 4's Woman's Hour.

Home Secretary Theresa May, who was ranked second in last year's inaugural Woman's Hour Power List, said Baroness Lawrence was 'an example to us all'.

Her son, an 18-year-old student, was stabbed to death by a group of up to six white youths in an unprovoked racist attack as he waited at a bus stop in Eltham, south east London, with a friend on April 22 1993. It took more than 18 years to bring two of his killers to justice.

Dignity: Doreen Lawrence, 61, whose son Stephen, 18, was murdered in a racist attack in 1993, has been named most powerful woman in the country by BBC Radio 4's Woman's Hour because 'she has never given up'

NHS whistleblower Julie Bailey, who helped expose failings at Stafford Hospital, is second on the list

Mrs May said: 'Faced by a terrible tragedy, she picked herself up and carried on fighting to ensure that justice could be done, and the fight still continues.

'What is most striking about this woman is the great strength that she has shown over decades - strength to carry on, to keep on going, even in the most difficult times when all seemed impossible.

'Also striking is the persistence that she has shown, because she has never given up.

'And finally, what is most impressive about this game-changer is that throughout it all, over the years, despite blow after blow, she has dealt with everything with absolute dignity.'

The list of ten women, described as 'game-changers', was revealed in a live programme and included individuals involved in issues including female genital mutilation (FGM), child poverty and internet safety.

Journalist Emma Barnett, who chaired the judging panel, said: 'It was no easy feat to come up with just 10 women who have 'changed the game' - so we had to develop a thesis.

'The ambition for this year's list was to capture a snapshot of a moment in time - of those particular 'games' in 2014 that need changing and the women making a real difference in those fields.

'FGM is now taken seriously by politicians, while internet safety and child poverty are among the biggest problems society faces, and we have highlighted the women leading the charge to make sustainable changes in these areas and seven others.'

Professor Nazneen Rahman, head of genetics at the Institute of Cancer Research, is honoured for her work researching the genes that cause cancer.

Dido Harding, CEO of TalkTalk Group, was named for her work with the government on the dangers of internet safety, and how to protect children online.

And Carmel McConnell, who founded the Magic Breakfast charity which works to present children from poverty-stricken families going to school hungry, was named fourth in the list.

Comedian and disability activist Francesca Martinez,  and Everyday Sexism  founder, Laura Bates, are named

Feminist and author Caitlin Moran, whose works include How To Be A Woman, is the last woman named
