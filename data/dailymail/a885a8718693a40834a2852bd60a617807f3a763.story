Cristiano Ronaldo now seems to rewrite the goalscoring history books every week, and with Saturday’s latest strike for Real Madrid the Portugal superstar broke a La Liga record that had stood for 79 years.

Ronaldo’s second-minute goal in Real’s 4-0 victory over Granada on Saturday took his total to 17 in the opening 10 games of the Spanish league season. That surpassed Isidro Langara’s long-standing record of 16 goals for Real Oviedo in 1935.

Last month the 29-year-old superstar beat Esteban Echevarria’s record from 1943 of 14 goals in seven La Liga games after scoring a double in a 5-0 win over Levante.

What makes Ronaldo’s feat even more impressive is that he has played in one game less than Langara, having missed one match for Real this season. Ronaldo has also scored for 13 games in succession in all competitions.

17 goals in nine league games this season.

274 goals in 261 games for Real Madrid. 

194 goals in 174 La Liga games.

26 hat-tricks.

22 La Liga hat-tricks.

17 Champions League goals in 2013-14.

If he keeps up his scoring average of 1.7 goals per game, Ronaldo could end up with a staggering 65 league strikes to his name this season, should he play every one of Real’s remaining fixtures.

That would comfortably beat Lionel Messi’s remarkable record of 50 goals in a La Liga season, set in 2011-12. The Barcelona striker’s goals-per-game average then was 1.4.

Ronaldo already holds the record for the most goals in a 38-game Premier League season. He notched 31 goals in the 2007-8 season, a feat matched by Luis Suarez for Liverpool last term, before moving to Madrid for a then world record fee of £80million in 2009.

Raul’s record of 323 goals for Madrid is the big number in Ronaldo’s sights, and with 274 to his name already it is seemingly inevitable that record will also be smashed.

In fact, should Ronaldo keep up his current La Liga scoring ratio this term and Real progress to the later stages of the Champions League and/or the Copa del Rey, he is guaranteed to do it before the end of this season.
