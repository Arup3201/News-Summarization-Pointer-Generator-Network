A Houston attorney's crazed ex-mistress has been sentenced to 20 years prison after the 'monster' hired three separate hitmen to murder her lover's wife.

Michelle Gaiser, 39, was handed the sentence today as part of a plea deal, just a week after claiming Jeffrey Stern - the man in the centre of the love triangle - made her orchestrate his wife Yvonne Stern's killing with a web of transsexual prostitutes, money and deviant sex.

At the sentencing, Ms Stern, who was shot in the stomach in a parking lot by the third assassin after two earlier attempts to kill her failed, accused the Harris County District Attorney's Office of being 'corrupt' by offering the agreement.

'It is clear that this monster is 
very unstable and she should spend the rest of her existence behind bars
where she cannot attempt to kill anyone else,' Ms Stern said. She had requested the plea deal be rejected.

Mr Stern had faced two counts of soliciting capital murder but earlier
this week prosecutors dropped the charges against him due to 
insufficient evidence. The 55-year-old has admitted the affair with Ms 
Gaiser but insisted he was not involved in the multiple attempts to kill
his wife.

Ms Stern has stuck by her husband through the affair and murder-for-hire plot against her. She said she forgave her husband for his infidelity, claiming the pair had become victims of a 'fatal attraction' situation.

After the hearing, Yvonne Stern 
declined to speak to reporters but her attorney, Chip Lewis, called the 
plea agreement 'laughable'. He accused District Attorney Pat Lykos of 
agreeing to the deal to appease Ms Gaiser's defense attorney, James 
Stafford, who he said was a long-time political ally and friend of Mr Lykos.

Mr Lewis said prosecutors had promised Ms 
Stern that Ms Gaiser would not be 
offered anything less than 40 years in any plea agreement.

Yvonne Stern told ABC's 20/20: 'The biggest joke of all. Jeff Stern's the mastermind. Is this the plot of a mastermind? My husband is brilliant. He would never be capable of doing such a terrible job'

The former mistress paid three 
different hitmen to kill Ms Stern.

After the first attempt - a drive-by 
shooting - failed, a second gunman missed her when he shot from behind 
glass at the couple's front door.

The woman was wounded in the third attempt, in May 2010, which saw her shot in the stomach.

In a brief written statement, 
prosecutor Kari Allen defended the agreement, saying Ms Gaiser's 
cooperation led investigators to the man who shot Ms Stern.

'With today's plea agreement, the Harris County District Attorney's 
Office has put a fourth person involved in attempts to murder Yvonne 
Stern behind bars,' Ms Allen said. 'Combined, members of these 
conspiracies have been sentenced to a total of ninety-five years in 
prison.'

Later Friday, in a separate written statement, Mr Lykos denied Lewis' claim that the plea agreement was done to benefit Ms Gaiser.

'Today's plea was (Allen's) decision, made after a careful review and 
thoughtful deliberation of the facts surrounding the Stern affair,' Mr 
Lykos said. 'I trust her judgment, and she has my full support.'

Mr Stafford denied claims his client was given special treatment. He said Ms Gaiser should have received less than 20 years
in prison because of the help she gave authorities.

'She is totally remorseful for what happened,' he said.

A lawsuit Yvonne Stern filed in March against Ms Gaiser, seeking damages for the attempts on her life, is still pending.

Papers filed last week by Ms Gaiser's
lawyers claim that she hired the men to kill her romantic competitor 
because Jeffrey Stern was 'emotionally manipulative' and subliminally 
convinced her that it was what he wanted.

The Houston Chronicle reports that 
the 14-page document is in response to Yvonne Stern's lawsuit in which 
she holds Gaiser financially responsible for the three hit men.

Gaiser's lawyers responded by saying 
that Yvonne's husband should be held jointly-responsible, but that 
solution will undoubtedly be rejected by Yvonne as she has stood by his 
side and dismissed any accusations that he was involved in the 
assassination attempts.

'Through sexual grooming, emotional 
manipulation, installation of fear creating dependence on him, 
restricting her options, Jeffrey Stern pulled the strings that led to 
the assault on his wife's life,' the report reads.

The lawyers allege that during their sexual dalliances, Jeffrey would ask Ms Gaiser to describe how she would kill his wife.

He would go on to say that she should get 'someone' to make those descriptions happen. 

'The master plan was that Jeffrey Stern wanted his wife dead, dead, dead,' the report states.

It goes on to say that in addition to
these conversations, Ms Gaiser and Stern's deviant sex life allegedly 
helped him assert control over her, which she argues prompted her 
decision to have his wife killed.

The couple met with transvestites and
transsexual male prostitutes. He flew her to Las Vegas for luxury 
getaways. And he made her dress up in his wife's underwear and bra while
they had sex in the Stern's million-dollar Houston mansion.

While the lawyers representing the 
three main characters- as well as many of the characters themselves- in 
this seemingly fictional court case have spoken freely with the press up
until this point, the judge has issued a gag order to keep them all 
quiet leading up to the beginning of the trial later this month.

Speaking to ABC's 20/20 in April, Yvonne 
Stern said of the charges: 'It's preposterous, I've known this man for 30 years, I know
who I'm lying next to.

'The biggest joke of all. Jeff Stern's the mastermind. Is this the
plot of a mastermind?

'My husband is brilliant. He's smart. He's 
talented. He would never be capable of doing such a terrible job.'

Convinced her husband was not involved in the 
plot against her, she says: 'I love my husband. I believe in him 
wholeheartedly, in his innocence. He had nothing to do with this. We are
victims of a fatal attraction.'

The previous accusation that emerged 
amid the continued media interest in the case ever since Gaiser was 
arrested was the assertion that Gaiser is now trying to take a hit on 
her ex-lover.

Stern's lawyer, Paul Nugent, claimed 
Gaiser, 39, is trying to recruit an inmate to kill Stern, 54, who is 
currently out on $1million bail.

Nugent told ABC News:
'Michelle Gaiser - from her jail cell - has plotted yet another murder.
She has solicited an inmate to murder Jeffrey Stern for $20,000.'

He added that it was her intention to make the killing look like a 'robbery gone bad.'

The first murder attempt was in February 2010, when a hitman blasted Mrs Stern's $800,000 Bellaire home in a drive-by shooting.

The mother-of-two and her children were not at home and escaped uninjured.

Two months later, gunman Nhut Nguyen rang the 
doorbell of her home and opened fire as she approached the door.

Target: Twice a hitman came to their million dollar home in Houston and tried to kill Yvonne - but luckily they missed both times

But Ms Stern was able to 
jump for cover as he shot through the glass.

She told ABC's 20/20 in an April interview: 'Approaching the door, I still saw no one, and then I see this
man jump out of the wall with a gun in his hand and a smirk on his 
face.

'The bullet hit the floor and ricocheted on the opposite wall...He barely missed.'

After the second attempt Yvonne and the children moved to a nearby apartment while Jeffrey Stern worked to secure his home.

It was there that the third attempt on her life took place in May, but this time the gunman didn't miss, shooting Ms Stern in the abdomen.

The third gunman - which the prosecution claim is Damian Flores -  approached 
Ms Stern as she sat in her car at their apartment's garage and pointed the gun at her head.

She begged and 
pleaded for her life and he walked away, only to turn around and point the gun to her 
abdomen, shooting her in the stomach.

Bleeding, she only survived by playing dead and driving to a nearby gas station for help.

Wearing
an orange jail jumpsuit, Ms Gaiser said she hired Flores for $40,000 in 
May 2010 after two previous attempts to kill Ms Stern failed.

She
claimed that she had given him $15,000 in cash upfront and instructed 
him to go to an apartment where Ms Stern had moved after the first two 
shootings.
