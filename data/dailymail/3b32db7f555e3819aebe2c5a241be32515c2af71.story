Brandishing two handguns in a California nightclub, this scantily-clad woman shows off her new acquisition - an official sheriff's badge proudly displayed on her cleavage.

The image has caused uproar as the badge belongs to a Cudahy councilman at the centre of an FBI corruption probe who had been given the credentials by the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department.

Sheriff Lee Baca has now decided to recall some 200 badges his department has handed out to local politicians just two weeks after the picture was released by the U.S. attorney's office in support of bribery charges against three city officials.

'Vulgar display': This picture of a woman brandishing two guns while wearing an official sheriff's badge has re-ignited the debate about the abuse of credentials handed out to civilians with no law-enforcement roles

Abused: The badge, which is similar to the official ones worn by LA County law enforcement officials (left), had been given to Cudahy councilman Osvaldo Conde (right), who has been accused by the FBI of taking bribes

The sheriff's department has long 
faced criticism for dishing out badges to civilians with no 
law-enforcement duties because of fears it could lead to abuse.

With the same six-pointed star design,
they are very similar to the ones worn by deputies, although they read 
'City Official Los Angeles County' instead of 'deputy sheriff'.

The department said the badges were handed out so civilians can pass through sheriff command posts during emergencies, but some believe they are issued as rewards for political contributions.

The gun-toting woman was pictured in 
the El Potrero nightclub in Cudahy wearing the badge given to Councilman
Osvaldo Conde, one of three officials accused of taking a total of 
$17,000 in bribes from the owner of a medical marijuana dispensary who 
wanted to open a store in the city.

Under pressure: LA County Sheriff Lee Baca (pictured) is now recalling some 200 badges given to politicians, but insists the timing of the move was not linked to the release of the picture of the gun-toting woman

The practice of giving out sheriff's badges to city officials has been around since 1986, according to an internal policy memo seen by the LA Times.

Law enforcement officials say the credentials are issued so civilians can pass through sheriff command posts during emergencies.

But critics claims it is more to do with rewarding political contributions.Â 

The policy was reviewed in 2010, but continued despite the attorney general's concerns that it could lead to abuse three years earlier.

Sheriff spokesman Steve Whitmore insisted the timing of the recall was coincidence and had actually been prompted by a warning by the state attorney general in 2007.

The AG's opinion was that the badges had to potential for civilians to falsely pose as police officers.

But when questioned by the Los Angeles Times about why it had taken more than four years to take action, he replied: 'That's a good question.'

Whitmore admitted the picture was a 'vulgar display', but said he was not aware of any other incident when a badge had been misused.

The LA Times reports, however, that it had been a problem in the past.

One of the most notable was the case of the 'Hillside Strangler' Kenneth Bianchi who had used a county emblem to pose as a police officer when luring his victims in the 1980s.

One political contributor revealed previously how they used their honorary badge to gain access to a secure area of Bob Hope Airport in Burbank.
