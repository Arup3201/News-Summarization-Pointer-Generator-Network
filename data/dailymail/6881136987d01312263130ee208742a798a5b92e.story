A two-year-old boy has died after his mother accidentally gave him liquid methadone that she stored in a Gatorade bottle, police have said.

Aiden Goff died and two of his siblings were hospitalized after their mother, Jill Goff, mistakenly served them the powerful drug in a sippy cup at their home in Tooele, Utah on Friday afternoon.

Methadone is a pain reliever that can 
also be used to help recovering addicts through withdrawal symptoms and its side effects can mimic 
heroine. Police believe she obtained the drug legally but they have not said why it was in liquid form or stored in a drink bottle.

Tragic: Aiden Goff, right, has died after his mother Jill Goff, left, accidentally served him methadone

Police were called to the home at 6pm 
on Friday when the 32-year-old mother found Aiden not breathing. 
Emergency responders tried to save him, but he died at the home.

Later that evening, the boy's eight-year-old brother and five-year-old sister went to the emergency room and both tested positive for methadone, police told the Salt Lake Tribune.

The boy had broken out in a rash and his eyes were swollen, according to a probable cause statement. Both of the children survived. The Goffs have five children in total.

The hospitalized children told relatives and detectives that their mother had given Aiden a drink but he did not like it, the probably cause statement said.

When he complained that he did not 
like it, the mother gave it to the five-year-old, who agreed it was 
disgusting. The eight-year-old then tasted it and he said it tasted like
 medicine, the Tribune reported.

Loss: Aiden drank from the cup his mother gave him on Friday afternoon. She was unaware that she had given him liquid methadone, which was being stored in a pink Gatorade bottle

Mother and son: Two of her other children also tasted the liquid but they survived after treatment. After realizing her mistake, Jill Goff put Aiden down for a nap but he did not wake up

'The children had told us there was a sippy cup passed around between the three of them that mom had prepared for them and it didnâ€™t taste right,' Tooele Police Captain Paul Wimmer told KSL.

Investigators believe that, rather than serving her child Gatorade, she inadvertently gave him methadone, which had been stored in the Gatorade bottle, Wimmer said.

The mother then realized that she had switched the liquids and tried to get her two-year-old son to throw up, the statement said. She then gave him a bath and put him down for a nap.

She told investigators that she did not call police because she was scared.

A 14-year-old sibling went to wake Aiden, but he wasn't responsive. Goff called 911.

She was arrested on suspicion of homicide, two counts of child abuse and endangerment of a child or vulnerable adult. She remained in the Tooele County jail.

Mix up: She served him pink liquid methadone (left) - a strong pain killer that has similar side effects to heroin - that had been stored in a Gatorade bottle (right). It is not clear why the drug was stored in the bottle

Scene: Goff went for a nap with Aiden at the home, pictured, and later found him unresponsive

Police said Goff has no prior record and they believe she did not intend to kill her son.

'While we donâ€™t have any evidence that suggests that she was trying to harm the children with it, there is a certain level of care that is required with such a dangerous substance and medication,' Wimmer said.

Her 
husband Cody described her as a loving mother, Fox 13 reported. The four other children - aged 5, 8, 11 and 14 - have been placed with relatives.

Facebook images show her doting over the five children and proudly posing with Aiden.

'I want to let you all know my baby boy Aiden Goff passed away in his momma arms tonight,' she wrote on her Facebook page on Friday.
