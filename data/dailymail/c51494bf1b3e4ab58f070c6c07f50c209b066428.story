Lloyds has racked up yet another bill of more than £1billion for mis-selling to customers and rigging interest rates.

The staggering cost was revealed yesterday, as the state-backed lender announced a sharp fall in profits in the first half of the year.

It has set aside another £600m to compensate customers mis-sold payment protection insurance, taking its total bill for the scandal to £10.4billion.

This equates to around £420 for every household in the UK, or an increase of 2p on income tax.

The total bill across the industry for PPI now tops £23billion, making it the most expensive mis-selling scandal to hit the UK.

But Lloyds, which is still 25pc owned by taxpayers, also revealed a £225million provision for other ‘legacy issues’.

The bulk of this money will be spent on trawling through past sales of investments and protection policies - paying compensation where necessary.

The bank was fined £28million by the City watchdog last year for promoting a ruthless sales culture, where some workers were told their pay would be halved if they missed sales targets.

Staff were also handed ‘grand in hand’ and ‘champagne bonuses’ for selling customers investments they did not want or need.

A £218million fine from UK and US regulators for rigging interest rates and defrauding British taxpayers was also included in the £1.1billion provision for wrongdoing announced yesterday.

Bank of England governor Mark Carney said employees ‘clearly broke the law’ after a series of banking scandals

Last night one MP expressed alarm at the spiralling bill.

Chris Leslie, shadow Treasury minister, said: ‘It beggars belief that just one bank has had to pay over £10billion for PPI, which is the equivalent of more than 2p on income tax for every household in the UK.

The sheer scale of continuing provisions for fines and misdemeanours suggests there is much more to do to reform the culture of banks in the UK.’

The mis-selling costs caused Lloyds profits to more than half to £863million, from £2.1billion in the same period last year.

It caps a torrid week for the lender, which could face a criminal investigation from the Serious Fraud Office for an extraordinary scam to defraud taxpayers.

Lloyds was hit on Monday with a £218million fine from UK and US regulators for rigging Libor interest rates.

Its traders also manipulated a separate rate used to set the fees to access more than £90 billion in emergency loans from a taxpayer-backed scheme run by the Bank of England during the financial crisis.

Between April 2008 and September 2009, four traders shortchanged the Treasury by cutting £7.8million off the fees.

In a furious letter Bank of England governor Mark Carney said the employees ‘clearly broke the law’ and could be guilty of ‘criminal conduct’.

The fine was included in the £1.1billion hit for misconduct.

Yesterday Lloyds boss Antonio Horta-Osorio, who took the helm in 2011, apologised to customers and shareholders.

He said: ‘This was as shocking to us as it was to you. We always knew we had legacy issues but this was probably the most disturbing. I’m sorry for the impact these actions have had on customers, colleagues and shareholder.’

The banks is now pursuing disciplinary action against 22 former and current staff, all of who have now been suspended.

The Bank of England this week announced tougher powers to strip rogue bankers of bonuses up to seven years after they were awarded – even if they have spent it.

But the new regime will only come into force on January 1 and will not be applied retrospectively.

Andy Silvester from the TaxPayers’ Alliance said: ‘Lloyds has acted reprehensibly for years, treating the very taxpayers who ended up bailing it out more like cash cows than customers. The bank has to be returned to private hands as soon as practically possible.’
