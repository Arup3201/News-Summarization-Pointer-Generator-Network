Shamari Jenkins was a few months pregnant on April 29 when she was shot and killed while driving in Hartford, Connecticut. Her unborn son was also killed.

The man who allegedly shot her was Matthew Hall-Davis, a friend of her boyfriend - 21-year-old Carlton 'CJ' Bryan, who was in the car with his girlfriend when the shooting happened.

But in a surprising turn in the case, Bryan may have actually been behind the shooting, according to court documents released Friday. 

Arraigned: Carlton Bryan, right, in court on Friday after he was charged in the murder of his pregnant girlfriend

Apparently Bryan had asked Jenkins to get an abortion, and she refused. He told a friend that she was 'trying to ruin his life and he wanted her killed.'

Bryan 'begged' Hall-Davis to shoot his 20-year-old girlfriend, according to his arrest warrant. Apparently he 'wanted to stay with...his other girlfriend,' Hall-Davis told the police.

The warrant goes on the explain the plan Bryan and Hall-Davis had for carrying out the murder.

Murder for two: Two men are being tried in the murder of Shamari Jenkins, her boyfriend Carlton Bryan, left, and his friend Matthew Hall-Davis, right. Jenkins was shot on April 29. She and her unborn son were later pronounced dead at St. Francis hospital

Hall-Davis would take Bryan's car and drive it to Enfield Street, park the vehicle and walk to Magnolia Street via a short cut where he would wait in the dark for the right time to shoot Jenkins. Jenkins and Bryan would be waiting at Magnolia Street, while another friend would observe from a house and call police, saying the shooter ran away.

But Hall-Davis couldn't muster it. He talked to Bryan who was smoking outside of the car where Jenkins was sitting. He told Hall-Davis to 'go back to Enfield Street and carry out the plan they had to kill Jenkins.'

Motive: Bryan had apparently told a friend that Jenkins was ruining his life by keeping their baby, and that's why he wanted her killed

Hall-Davis agreed but planned to shoot Bryan instead of the girlfriend. He missed, however, and shot the original target. Jenkins was taken to St. Francis Hospital and Medical Center where she and her unborn baby boy were later pronounced dead. She had already picked out a name for the child: Ja'seon Carlton.

In the aftermath of the shooting, Bryan apparently lied twice to police about his girlfriend's death.

Explanation number one was that he and Jenkins were waiting for a cousin to bring them $50 dollars and that he didn't know who the shooter was.

On second questioning, he changed his tune saying that they were waiting to buy marijuana, and that their dealers never showed up. He blamed someone called 'Low' who he met in jail for shooting Jenkins, but the man had an alibi.

The case changed course May 20 when the lookout for the shooting told police it was Bryan who orchestrated the event. Another confidante, Kingsley Minto, was arrested with Hall-Davis for a few jewelry store robbings and told police about helping to hide the gun used to shoot Jenkins.

Bryan was arraigned Friday. He was charged Thursday night with murder, conspiracy to commit murder, carrying a pistol without a permit and second-degree making a false statement.

Family members of Jenkins were quite surprised by the turn of events. Jenkins' cousin Shakaria Matthews told Fox Connecticut that Byran attended Jenkins' funeral and vigil and said he didn't do it. At the vigil he was was even caught on camera acting distraught.

'It was hard - real hard - to see him knowing he used to come to my house and stay the night and talk with me, and then for him to turn around and do something like this,' Todd Jenkins, the victim's father, told Fox Connecticut. 

Bryan is currently being held on $2.5 million bail.
