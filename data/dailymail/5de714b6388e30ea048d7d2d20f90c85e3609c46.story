Marshawn Lynch will remain with the Seattle Seahawks.

The enigmatic running back had apparently pondered retirement, but he penned a new two-year, $24million extension to keep him in the NFL until 2017.

Lynch travelled to Seattle to meet owner Paul Allen and Seahawks top brass and put pen to paper, according to NFL Insider Ian Rapoport.

Marshawn Lynch has signed a new two-year deal which will keep him in Seattle until 2017

Lynch propelled Seattle to within a yard of back-to-back Super Bowl titles, but the Seahawks were thwarted

The 28-year-old has rushed for over 1,200 yards for each of the past four seasons. Since joining Seattle from Buffalo in 2010, no running back has rushed for more touchdowns than Lynch, with 54.

If Russell Wilson is the face of the franchise, 'Beast Mode' is its heart and soul.

After helping Seattle to their first Vince Lombardi trophy in 2014, Lynch played through the pain of a compressed cartilage in his back and carried the Seahawks to within a yard of retaining their title.

Lynch gave a lengthy interview to Turkish TV station NTV Spor last week about the final play of Super Bowl XLIX.

'To be honest with you, I would be lying if I didn't tell you that I was expecting the ball. Yes, I was expecting the ball. 'But in life, these things happen. Like I told a reporter after the game, it's a team sport.'

The Seahawks also announced they have terminated the contract of tight end Zach Miller.
