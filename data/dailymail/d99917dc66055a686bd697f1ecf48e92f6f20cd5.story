James Rodriguez took further steps closer to a Real Madrid return on Wednesday as the Colombian joined his team-mates for a full training session.

The 23-year-old, signed from Monaco for £63million last summer, has been out with a fractured metatarsal since February and first returned to the training pitch earlier this month.

After taking part in some small-sided football tennis games on Tuesday, Rodriguez joined Wednesday's full session with the players left in Madrid for the two-week international break.

Carlo Ancelotti's team held a moment of silence ahead of the training session in memory of the victims of the French Alps plane crash before Rodriguez and Co were put through their paces.

Ancelotti will be hoping Rodriguez is available for Madrid's next La Liga fixture against Granada on April 5 as the Italian looks for a reaction from his team following the 2-1 defeat against Barcelona last Sunday. 

Madrid's El Clasico defeat at the Nou Camp, their third defeat in their last four outings in all competitions, left them four points behind leaders Barca in second place and heaped pressure onto Ancelotti's team.

Sergio Ramos, however, insists that his side must focus on the positives in order to finish the campaign strongly. 

'A defeat is always negative but you can also draw some positive conclusions,' Ramos, one of Real's club captains, said in an interview with Spanish radio.

'We lost with our heads held high ... because Madrid played some good football,' added the Spain international.

'From my point of view the first half was extraordinary. We weren't able to kill off the game and they punished us at the end.'
