Three people were arrested Friday morning after a fight erupted outside a Pasadena, California, Apple Store where a crowd waited overnight for release of the new iPhone.

Police say one of the men appears to have been among several homeless men who were hired to buy the iPhones 5C and 5S for other customers.

When the store ran out of the new smartphones, the homeless men didn't get paid and became upset, according to Police Lt. Jason Clawson.

Clawson says the homeless man was placed on a 72-hour mental health hold after running into the street in an enraged state.

Two of the men were arrested at about 7.30am after getting into a fistfight while in line along Colorado Boulevard.

They face misdemeanour citations. It was unclear what the fight was about, but no significant injuries were reported. It is unclear whether all the men were homeless.

iPhone fans who did not want to stand in line hired the homeless people to do it for them.

 homeless people were seen standing in line on Friday in Pasadena for 
the release of the two new smartphones, which went on sale at Apple and

'Nothing else to do': Homeless person, Mickie, who was hired to sit in line, said she did not mind the wait as she had nothing better to do

One of the homeless people said it suited her well, as she had no other plans.

‘I
 was asked yesterday if I would be willing to sit in line for someone so
 they could get a phone. I said “Sure, I’ve got nothing else to do”. So 
I’m here,’ said Mickie, who was driven from the Midnight Mission area 
along with 10 others.

‘They dropped us, sit in line, get the vouchers and then we’ll be paid,’ she added.

Mickie did not want to reveal how much she was getting paid, saying it was ‘personal’.

However, others in line said they were being paid as little as $35 to wait in line for several hours.

Vouchers were given out at 6am to those in line.

According
 to one fan, Francisco Naranjo, who began camping Sunday night outside 
of the company’s Pasadena store, the new iPhone is ‘just something you 
need to have’.

The wait is over: The new iPhone 5s, bottom, and the new iPhone 5c, top, were released today to excited fans, some of whom hired homeless people to wait in line for them

Apple aficionados around the world 
have been queuing outside stores since Monday to ensure they become the 
first to get their hands on the iPhones 5C and 5S, which use fingerprint
 recognition to unlock.

In
 New York, hundreds of handset hunters camped in the street outside the 
city's flagship store on Fifth Avenue eagerly waiting for the 
apple-embossed glass doors to swing open. Some had been waiting outside the store for weeks.

In Texas, fans camping outside the Houston store were held at gunpoint and robbed them of all their wallets, old phones, and tablets.

Wall
 Street analysts predicted more than two million iPhone 5s' to fly off 
shelves per day.

The iPhone 5S comes in three colours, black, silver and gold. The device ranges from $199 to $399, depending on the amount of memory.

‘It has a new fingerprint reader, so it’s going to be able to lock your phone and other features. It’s going to have a faster processor, it’s going to be a faster phone,’ Naranjo told KNX 1070.

The new phones were available online at 12.01am.
