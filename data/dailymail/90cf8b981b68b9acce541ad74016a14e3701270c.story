Drew Peterson's ex-wife told her sister that she believed he would kill her, then begged her sister to take care of her two sons, just six weeks before her death, the sister testified on Friday.

Anna Doman provided the trial's first testimony including what prosecutors have called 'from the grave' statements -- comments Peterson's ex-wife Kathleen Savio allegedly made to others about him threatening to kill her well before her body was found in her bathtub.

Peterson is charged with first-degree murder in the 2004 drowning death of Savio, his third wife. He was charged in Savio's death after his fourth wife, Stacy Peterson, went missing in 2007.

Drew Peterson's ex-wife's sister told the court: 'Kathleen said that Drew told her he was going to kill her, she was not going to make it to the divorce settlement, she would not get his pension or his children'

Hearsay evidence about what Savio allegedly said to other people is crucial to prosecutors, who have acknowledged they have no physical evidence linking Peterson to Savio's death.

'She said that Drew told her he was going to kill her, she was not going to make it to the divorce settlement, she would not get his pension or his children,' said Doman, referring to what prosecutors have said was a settlement involving two homes, a tavern Peterson and Savio owned and Peterson's pension from his career as a Bolingbrook police officer.

'She made me promise over and over that I would take care of her boys, over and over (she said), "I want to hear you say it because everything's going to them".'

Hearsay, or statements not based on the direct knowledge of a witness, is not usually admissible in court.

But Illinois judges can allow in murder trials under certain circumstances.

Doman's testimony was the most dramatic so far in the trial that, since beginning on Monday, has been beset by a series of prosecutorial blunders that prompted the judge to seriously consider granting a request by Peterson's attorneys to declare a mistrial.

Judge: Edward Burmila decided against declaring a mistrial in Peterson's murder case on Thursday, saying the former police officer still can get a fair trial despite several blunders by prosecutors

But during intense cross examination, Doman acknowledged she didn't tell police about Savio's alleged comments until three years later, shortly after Peterson's fourth wife, Stacy, disappeared.

Peterson has been named a suspect in that disappearance but has not been charged.

'You sat on that for three years,' defense attorney Joe Lopez said to Doman, who acknowledged never voicing any suspicions about Peterson to the county coroner or police after Savio died.

She also said she invited Peterson and his sons to a banquet at a Polish hall shortly after Savio's death.

Doman did not dispute Lopez's assertion that when she did come forward with details and documents about Savio, it was not to police, but to a producer from Greta Van Susteren's cable television show -- one of many media representatives who descended on Peterson's Bolingbrook home after Stacy Peterson disappeared.

Doman said 'no one would listen' when she tried to call police, but she acknowledged she did not have any documentation of the calls she said she made.

She also quietly admitted under cross-examination that after her sister's death she never tried to get custody of Savio's children or even contact them or send them birthday or Christmas cards.

Doman's testimony was cut short on Friday after the judge recessed the court because of a sick juror. A male juror had been repeatedly coughing and testimony had been interrupted several times to let him recover.

Before the recess prosecutors had planned to call a retired Illinois State Police sergeant who was in charge of the investigation of Savio's death and a crime scene technician who responded to Savio's house the night her body was found.

Judge Edward Burmila said the trial would reconvene on Tuesday.

A furious Burmila admonished prosecutors on Wednesday after the second witness in just their second day of testimony began talking about finding a .38-caliber bullet on his driveway.

Thomas Pontarelli, a former neighbor of Savio's, hinted in his testimony that Peterson may have planted it there to intimidate him.

Prosecutors later admitted under tough questioning by the judge that there was no evidence to support the claim.

And Burmila wondered aloud about whether the testimony made Peterson appear menacing in jurors' eyes and undermined his ability to get a fair trial.

But after heated arguments by both sides on Thursday morning, Burmila told attorneys that 'the court believes that the defendant's ability to receive a fair trial is not extinguished at this time'.

Prosecutors contend Peterson killed Savio and tried to make it look like an accident.

Defense
attorney Joel Brodsky told jurors repeatedly during his opening 
statement that there was no evidence Savio's death was anything but a 
tragic accident.

His
defense attorney's argued on Tuesday that Peterson was a victim of a 
24-hour news cycle and cable TV's talking heads, which together created a
media frenzy that did not subside until prosecutors had charged an 
innocent man.

Will County State's Attorney James Glasgow told jurors that Peterson, 58, killed Savio, 40, and made it look like an accident.

'Just weeks before her death, he told her he was going to kill her and she would not make it to a divorce settlement and would never get his pension,' Glasgow said during opening statements.

Peterson's real-life drama inspired a TV movie and a national spotlight was put on the case, as many speculated whether Peterson used his law-enforcement expertise to get away with Savio's murder and make 23-year-old Stacy Peterson vanish.

The
outcome of the trial may also hang on which forensic pathologist the 
seven men and five women on the jury will believe: Bryan Mitchell or 
Larry Blum.

Mitchell, 
who investigated Savio’s death in 2004 and ruled that a gash on her head
and bruises on her body were consistent with an accidental fall, died 
earlier this year. The defense will likely call expert witnesses to 
testify that the woman’s death was accidental.

Blum, who investigated Savio's body 
after it was exhumed in 2007, will testify for the prosecution at the 
trial about what made him switch the cause of death from an accidental 
fall to homicidal drowning.

‘First, they are not going to be able
to say that (the death investigation was botched) because it wasn't,’ 
Peterson's attorney said. ‘By saying that if they had done a better job 
in the investigation, then they would have been able to prosecute Drew 
Peterson, that lowers the burden of proof. Where you don't have 
evidence, you presume innocence.’
