When Lenny Walters informed his bank that his wife had been diagnosed with terminal lung cancer, he discovered a horrifying secret: she had taken out two loans against their house, racking up £48,000 worth of debt.

Joyce died six years ago, just months after Lenny found out about her betrayal. The widower from Pembrokeshire now faces losing his house to the bank and has delayed his retirement to stay on top of the debt.

Tragically, he says that he can never forgive her.

Lenny Walter appeared on ITV This Morning with his daughter Katy to talk about his devastating discovery

It was only when Lenny offered to take over the family finances after his wife was diagnosed with terminal cancer that he discovered the secret debt

Speaking on ITV’s This Morning with his daughter Katy, Lenny, 62, said: ‘It was six months after diagnosis that I discovered it, only because I said I was going to take over the finances because she wasn’t well.

‘I shouldn’t have said anything because then I wouldn’t have known anything about it until after she passed away. The day after I said I would take control of the finances she did a runner.

‘I only had said I would pay the bills and the next day she was gone because she knew I would find out.'

‘I found out that I was massively in debt by £48,000.'

Lenny’s wife had taken out loans against the value of their home, redirecting mail from the bank to a resource centre where she worked to hide the issue from her husband.

Her fraud involved her forging his signature twice to take out the loans. After her lies were discovered, Joyce fled the family home, moving in with her niece, miles away in Stanwell, Surrey.

Lenny didn't see his wife again until he went to visit her in hospital on her death bed.

Despite the huge amount of money spent, Lenny says he has no idea why Joyce needed it. 

Katy says she believes her mother's spending habits and Bingo playing created the debt

‘I have no idea. We were solvent, we were both working. The kids had left home and we had a low mortgage, if any.’

However, daughter Katie suspects a combination of Bingo debts and overspending over years may have been to blame.

‘She had always been an over spender, she’d always buy two of everything. Because it had been that way for years you didn’t question it.

‘When she died she was living with me and I found loads of clothes with tags on that she hadn’t even worn. She just kept buying and buying.’

Despite receiving a letter of apology from Joyce  Lenny, who now faces losing his home, says he cannot forgive her

Lenny has battled with the bank for years in attempt to stay in the family home but faces losing it, and with it his children’s inheritance, in a forced sale to repay the debt.

A month after Lenny, who works as a fisherman, discovered the financial problems he received a letter from Joyce, in which she wrote: ‘I know you must hate me, and who can blame you. You are a hard working man, loving and kind and a heart of gold, you made me a very happy woman and now I have left you because of money.

'This is all my fault not yours, I was spending far too much and it got out of control and I just didn’t know how to get out of it.’

But despite this apology and having been married for nearly 30 years, Lenny says that he still cannot forgive his wife, who died age 56.

‘I can’t forgive her intent, wanting to do that to me. If you’re married for 30 years  you don’t do that. That’s your best mate.

‘I gave her everything and she gave me everything - we had a good marriage. I don’t understand what happened.’
