Wayne Rooney's short tenure as Manchester United captain hit its lowest ebb on Sunday and he wasn't afraid to give his team-mates a rollicking as the Red Devils capitulated at Leicester.

The 28-year-old publicly lambasted virtually all his colleagues as his side let a 3-1 lead slip against the Foxes to lose 5-3.

Rooney's famous tempter was in full flow as United conceded their third goal scored by Esteban Cambiasso.

Cambiasso's strike prompted the forward to explode in a fit of rage with Ander Herrera, Daley Blind and Tyler Blackett, the players closest, bearing the brunt.

Rooney's mood would have only worsened as Jamie Vardy completed the remarkable turned around in the 79th minute before  Leonardo Ulloa completed the scoreline with a penalty as Blackett was sent off for a foul on Vardy inside the box.

The England forward was appointed by United boss Louis van Gaal during pre-season and has currently led the Old Trafford outfit to five points from five games so far - with the only victory coming against QPR last week.

After enjoying such a comprehensive win over the west London side, Van Gaal found the defeat at the King Power Stadium hard to take.

'We start last match against QPR very good with a new team, new players and then we played very well here, but we gave the game away,' the United manager said after the defeat at Leicester.

'Leicester had five shots on goal, and that was it. These five goals were existing because we made errors in ball possession.

'We created a lot of chances and made superb goals but you have to do that over 90 minutes, not 60 minutes. It was not enough today.

'You have to kill the game and we didn't do that.'
