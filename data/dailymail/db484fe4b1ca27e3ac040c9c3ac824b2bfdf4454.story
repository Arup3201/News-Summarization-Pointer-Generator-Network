With courses on David Beckham, Harry Potter and politicising Beyoncé on offer at prestigious universities, it comes as no surprise that students are now able to learn the art of the perfect 'selfie'.

Budding photographers will be taught valuable life skills to prepare them to face an expectant world which could present a photo opportunity at any point as part of a new City Lit course in London.

As well as offering guidance on the most flattering angles and lighting, the course - officially called 'The art of self portraiture' – promises to 'improve your critical understanding' of the 'selfie'.

The 'selfie' trend went viral after Ellen DeGeneres' star-stuffed Oscar photo (pictured) and now City Lit college in London is offering a course in taking the perfect self-portrait

The path to the perfect profile picture will cost you just £132 (£106 for seniors) – but potential students should be warned that it does not come with a free 'selfie' stick.

It is open to all, including those who have only 'engaged in self-portrait –even in the most casual way'.

But the 'selfie' enthusiasts must be prepared to share their snaps, as organisers said a critique of students' work would form an important role in the learning process. 

Over four sessions, students will be taught to 'use light and significant detail' in their work and 'explain ideas of space, place and surrounding issues'.

Even David Cameron and Barack Obama got involved, but their selfie during Nelson Mandela's memorial service with Denmark's prime minister, Helle Thorning-Schmidt, caused controversy 

There will be a brief exploration into the notions of 'identity, self-hood and memory' as well as the opportunity to 'develop new ideas to make your photography more relevant to your aims'.

It is ideal for those who have an understanding of ISO, aperture, shutter speed, white balance and how to change these on your digital SLR or bridge camera.

The 'selfie' phenomenon is so widespread that it was only a matter of time before courses started offering guidance on the most flattering angles and lighting.

Twitter declared 2014 as the year of the 'selfie' after Ellen DeGeneres' star-stuffed Oscar photo was retweeted more than three million times - a Twitter record. 

The trend became so popular that it even inspired a song, '#SELFIE' by The Chainsmokers, which racked up 267 million views on YouTube.
