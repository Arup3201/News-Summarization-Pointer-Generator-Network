A nursery nurse has become the North's 'real life' Princess Elsa from smash-hit film Frozen. 

Samantha Van Rossen was used to putting on shows for her pre-school children at Elswick House Nursery School in Newcastle.

But after seeing the Disney smash hit - which is the highest-grossing animated film of all time with takings of $1.1 billion so far - she decided to buy an 'Elsa' Ice Queen dress and offer her services on Facebook.

Since becoming the 'real-life Elsa', Samantha has been inundated with requests for appearances at toddlers' birthday parties and shows.

'I've got seven Elsa jobs in one day just before Christmas, and I'm averaging three a week,' the 30-year-old from Fenham said. 'When kids see me they really think I'm Elsa. It's really taken off.'

Frozen has united young and old, girls and boys with its feelgood tale of sisterly love. And the sold-out Frozen 'Snow Glow' Elsa doll is the most sought-after Christmas present of the year in the UK, changing hands for up to £90 online.

'I noticed that there was an Elsa costume available to hire and I thought I could do it myself using my childcare experience to enhance it,' Samantha said. 'So I bought a dress and made a Facebook page. What I like about it is that I know that I'm making memories for those families and that it will be a memory that will last a lifetime.'

Clocking up almost 400 'likes' and five stars already on the social media site, Samantha wakes up every morning to at least one new Elsa booking request. In a 20-minute routine to transform into Elsa, Samantha backcombs her hair, puts in extensions, does her makeup and places on her turquoise-coloured sparkly dress.

Then she spends time with children where they have singalongs, dance and story time.

Mother-of-two Marie Air, 36, from Bedlington booked 'Elsa' for her four-year-old daughter Libby's birthday, earlier this month. 'Libby cried herself to sleep in bed that night because she loved Elsa so much. She dresses up as Elsa almost every day and everything in our house has to do with Elsa. We have every toy, we have the Frozen film going and the music playing every day. Sam was absolutely amazing. The children were gobsmacked, she looks really, really good. I had to explain to Libby that Elsa had to go report to Santa and that she had to go work on the next film.'

Lisa Doyle, 41, from Gateshead said her daughter Isla almost cried when Samantha as Elsa arrived at her seventh birthday party. Elsa came as a surprise during the Frozen-themed party which made Isla happy after she had been unwell with a virus. 'She's such a bubbly character and she's super to do that role,' said Lisa, speaking of Samantha. 'She brought so much happiness and sparkle to the room. I started to cry when we all sang Let It Go because we were singing our hearts out and it was just such a special moment.'

Samantha believes that the film has become so popular among children because it is not a traditional storyline. She said: 'It's not like other stories where the princess meets the prince. I think the catchy songs, and the fact that she's saved by her sister, has made it popular.'

Samantha, who has three stepchildren of her own, said they are in awe of her role-playing as Elsa. She said: 'The youngest, who is five, was confused if her stepmum really was Elsa.'

'I would love to do this full-time,' Samantha said. 'The goal is to have an army of princesses and develop male characters. I want to run parties during the day, have loads of events and continue to do charity appearances.'
