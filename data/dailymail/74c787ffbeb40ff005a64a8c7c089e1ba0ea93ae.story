Lance Armstrong has been stripped of his 2000 Olympic Games cycling time trial bronze medal by the International Olympic Committee, continuing his spectacular fall from grace.

'We have written asking for the return of the medal from the Sydney 2000 Games,' an IOC official told Reuters on Thursday after the decision to take away the last major title won by the disgraced American.

The move was confirmed to the AP on the same day that Armstrong's admission of using performance-enhancing drugs – after years of denials – is to be broadcast in an interview with Oprah Winfrey.

Retired Armstrong was stripped of his seven Tour de France titles and banned for life by the International Cycling Union (UCI) in October after several riders testified that he took drugs.

The testimony came in a United States Anti-Doping Agency (USADA) report in which the 41-year-old's former U.S. Postal team was accused of running 'the most sophisticated, professionalized and successful doping program that sport has ever seen'.

Armstrong, a cancer survivor who founded the Livestrong Foundation, has always denied wrongdoing but is due to appear on U.S. television later on Thursday with reports saying he will confess to taking banned substances.

The 2000 bronze was the only Olympic medal Armstrong ever claimed despite dominating cycling by winning the Tour from 1999 to 2005.

He retired for a second time in 2011.

The IOC had been preparing to make a move for the medal for months but decided at its executive board meeting in December to wait for the UCI to inform the athlete of the titles taken from him and give him the right to appeal.

Lance Armstrong faces a series of interviews over his sordid past if he is to one day return to sporting competition.The World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) and International Cycling Union (UCI) have told Armstrong, whose interview by Oprah Winfrey is to be broadcast later this week, to share his information with the authorities.The motives for an admission - revealed by Winfrey - are unclear, but the 41-year-old Texan, who retired from cycling for a second time in 2010, was competing in triathlons until he was banned last year.Reacting to Winfrey's comments ahead of Thursday's broadcast of the first part of the interview, WADA director general David Howman said in a statement: 'Only when Mr Armstrong makes a full confession under oath - and tells the anti-doping authorities all he knows about doping activities - can any legal and proper process for him to seek any reopening or reconsideration of his lifetime ban commence.'The UCI, cycling's world governing body, also urged Armstrong to co-operate with official channels and join the independent review it set up in the aftermath of the USADA report.

The IOC executive board discussed revoking the medal last month, but delayed a decision until cycling body UCI formally notified Armstrong he had been stripped of his seven Tour de France titles and all results since 1998. He then had 21 days to appeal.

Now that the deadline has expired, the IOC decided to take the medal away. The letter to Armstrong also was sent to the U.S. Olympic Committee.

'Following the recent decisions of USADA and the UCI regarding the competitive cycling results of Lance Armstrong, the IOC has disqualified Armstrong from the events in which he competed at the Sydney 2000 Olympic Games,' the IOC said in a statement.

'Namely, the men's individual road race, where he finished 13th, and the men's individual time trial, where he finished 3rd and was awarded with a bronze medal and a certificate.'

The IOC has asked Armstrong to return the medal and certificate to the United States Olympic Committee which should send them on to the Olympic ruling body.

'The decision was taken in principle at the IOC Executive Board meeting in December, but its implementation required the expiration of the appeal deadline,' the IOC said.

Spaniard Abraham Olano Manzano came 
fourth in the Sydney time trial and the IOC official said it had yet to 
be decided if he would be moved up to bronze.

IOC
sources said, however, it was very unlikely Manzano would be promoted 
because the organization preferred to leave the medal vacant as it has 
done with the medals of American athlete Marion Jones, also a doping 
offender, from the same Games.

Oprah Winfrey's OWN Network have begun a countdown clock ahead of the sensational interview with Lance Armstrong that airs tonight and Friday

Contrite? Armstrong has been stripped of his Olympic medal

An IOC spokesman said: 'We have written to Armstrong asking for him to return the medal and informed the US Olympic Committee.

'It was a decision taken in principle at the executive board before Christmas. We were waiting for confirmation from the UCI that he hadn't appealed against his disqualification.'

The shamed icon was written to by the IOC after telling Oprah Winfrey that, despite years of denials, his seven Tour de France titles were fueled by illegal stimulants - an admission that prompted the world's leading crusader against drugs in sport to question cycling's place in the Olympic Games.

Dick Pound, an IOC member and the former head of the World Anti- Doping Agency, said if the governing UCI are complicit in Armstrong's doping offences, 'the only way they are going to clean up is if all these people say, "Hey, we're no longer in the Olympics and that's where we want to be so let's earn our way back into it".

'The IOC would have to deal with it. The UCI are not known for their strong actions in anti-doping. It was the same in weightlifting a few years ago.

'All of a sudden when you get right up against it things go fuzzy and they say, "Well, we can't punish innocent athletes in these sports by dropping the sport from the program".'

Coming clean: Oprah Winfrey said both she and Armstrong were exhausted after the interview

The bleak news mounted up for Armstrong last night with Pound's former organisation, WADA, insisting that the Oprah Winfrey mea culpa will not result in his lifetime ban from sport being overturned.

They told Armstrong that giving evidence 'under oath' - rather than to America's talk show queen - was the only conceivable way he could compete again in his favourite post-cycling pursuit, triathlon.

Those sobering words arrived after Winfrey appeared on the CBS This Morning programme to talk up her exclusive interview.

She confirmed that the 41-year-old Texan finally admitted to cheating.

But hinting at an unexpected turn of events, Winfrey teased: 'He did not come clean in the manner I expected.'

Drama: Lance Armstrong admitted doping to Oprah Winfrey

Asked if Armstrong was contrite, 
Winfrey said: 'I choose not to characterise. I would rather people make 
their own decisions. I thought he was serious. I thought he certainly 
prepared himself for this moment. He met the moment.'

After the interview, Winfrey took the
film away personally 'in my bag along with dog food' ahead of its 
broadcast in Britain on the Discovery Channel at 2am on Friday morning, 
with the second part the following day.

Armstrong is being assailed by 
lawsuits - potentially including one from US Postal, his former team - 
so we can be sure as ever the fallen star is calculating the cost of his
every word.
