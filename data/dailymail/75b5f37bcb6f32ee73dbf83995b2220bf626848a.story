A B&B owner launched a Basil Fawlty-style rant at problem guests who left a bad review of his hotel on TripAdvisor.

When one couple described a ‘nightmare’ stay at Crags Hotel in Perthshire, Scotland, Alex Scrivenor hit back, accusing them of getting drunk, threatening other guests, damaging a wall, and failing to pay their £400 bill after they were removed by police.

The original review read: 'Stay clear of this hotel was the 
worst experience ever. Very poorly managed extremely disappointed:(

Hitting back: B&B owner Alex Scrivenor launched a Basil Fawlty-style rant at problem guests who left a bad review of his hotel on TripAdvisor

Negative: The original review read: 'Stay clear of this hotel was the worst experience ever. Very poorly managed extremely disappointed:(

'Was a nightmare from very beginning as they double booked our room and continually lied to us about the booking.

'Our friends came all the way from England and were very disappointed as their booking was wrong also......will stay clear of this hotel and advise everyone else to!!!!'

In his rebuke, which has since been removed from the website, Mr Scrivenor said he had given the couple a free bottle of wine, £15 off their Valentine’s night stay plus a free overnight stay in March as an apology for double-booking their room.

Response: Mr Scrivenor hit back, accusing the guests of getting drunk, threatening other guests, damaging a wall, and failing to pay their £400 bill

Anger: Mr Scrivenor signed off from his rebuke as 'Basil'

He also accused the guests of deciding to get 'incoherently drunk', before adding that his doctor has advised him to control his anger and that he would try to be 'understanding' and 'balanced'.

He wrote: 'From henceforth I will remember Valentine’s as the miserable day that I had the misfortune to meet you, your husband and your friends from England!'

'And the 16th Feb will now be called "Hatchet Sunday" in memory of the review you left us.

'I understand that you were angry with me... to arrive at a hotel and be told that you can’t have the room you booked is frustrating! I get that! That is why I gave you a free bottle of wine... and £15 off the room... and a free night’s stay in March!

Fighting talk: Mr Scrivenor write that he would remember Valentine's as the 'miserable day that I had the misfortune to meet you, your husband and your friends from England'

Check out: Mr Scrivenor said the guests were escorted out of his hotel in Callander, Perthshire by police who arrested the reviewer’s husband for threatening behaviour, criminal damage and breach of the peace

'(I was contemplating also throwing in a wee hug for you both... but I felt there might be health consequences!)

'I have struggled to understand why you then felt the need to go on a drunken rant through the hotel, threatening customers and shouting abuse? (hmmmm)?

'I also have tried to understand why your husband wanted to drag me outside for a ‘kicking’, as he put it? (hang on a sec, do I really need to try and understand this sort of behaviour)? and the massive hole in the wall of my hotel?

Positive: The hotel owner said the review had done more good than harm as he was able to present the B&B in a favourable light

'The one you kicked with your size 7 clodhoppers? must I try and be understanding that (I feel the anger rising... ).'

Mr Scrivenor said the guests were escorted out of his hotel in Callander, Perthshire by police who arrested the reviewer’s husband.

Police Scotland confirmed that officers had been called to the hotel on Valentine's Day and a wall in a bedroom had been damaged.

A spokeswoman said: 'A 45-year-old man has been charged following a vandalism at a hotel in Callendar on 14th February 2014.'

The hotel owner also commented on the reviewer giving just one star out of five for each of TripAdvisor’s categories - value, location, sleep quality, rooms, cleanliness and service.

Mr Scrivenor posted another ranting response to an unhappy guest who complained about a noisy toilet on 
TripAdvisor in March 2012.

The
 visitor said: 'The TV had been stolen by the last guests
 and so had pretty much anything that was not nailed down.

'The room we were showed to was on the top floor and as soon as we walked in we both regretted booking this place.

'The
 bed had a dip in the mattress supported by some wood on the floor, the 
toilet when flushed made a sound akin to a Spitfire engine starting up 
and overall it was very cramped.'

Mr Scrivenor hit back by outlining the differences between Spitfire fighter planes and the sound of a flushing toilet.

Second round: Mr Scrivenor posted another ranting response to an unhappy guest who complained about a noisy toilet on TripAdvisor in March 2012

Repost: Mr Scrivenor's response to the reviewer, named as 'Andrew E'

In character: Again the review was signed off 'Basil', a reference to the hotelier in comedy series Fawlty Towers

He
 said: 'I am concerned by your simile? I hope you don’t really think 
that I have powered my toilet with a supercharged V12 Rolls-Royce 
engine! I am all for disposing of waste but that would be going a little
 far!

'In order to seek 
clarity I suggest you go to YouTube and type in ‘Spitfire Sounds’ there 
are a number of videos that show MK19 Spitfires in action. I think you 
will agree that they do not sound like my toilet.

'Don’t
 get me wrong? I am not defending my toilet? it does not make a nice 
noise. But do you know? In all my puff I have never heard a flushing 
toilet that made me lie back in bed, slip my weary fins behind my head 
and think “aaaaah nice!”

Popular: The Crags Hotel currently has an overall TripAdvisor rating of four out of five

'If
 you disagree with anything that I have written then I would be only too
 pleased to offering you lodgings once again (not free of charge, mind 
you!) and we can sit in the toilet together and thrash it out!

'If
 you chose to take me up on this kind offer then please remember that it
 clearly states on all websites that check in is from 2pm and you might 
want to bring some sandwiches if the debate is going to stretch into the
 evening? or maybe you would like it if we opened the restaurant just 
for you!'

Mr Scrivenor, 41, who runs his three-star B&B with wife Victoria, 39, even signs off his reply with 'Basil' - a reference to Basil Fawlty.

The father-of-two said: 'I was outraged when I read the review.

Upset: The father-of-two said he was 'outraged' when her read the review on TripAdvisor

Over the edge: The owner said that the reviewer felt 'they could rub salt into the wounds with a horrible review'

'Having done all these things while they were here they felt they could rub salt into the wounds with a horrible review. It tipped me over the edge.

'If a guest has a genuine grievance or bad experience they deserve to be treated with respect and a management response that is apologetic.

'But when people are just out for revenge for something, it needs to be treated in the same way.'

He added: 'I see Trip Advisor as a very useful tool for hoteliers. I think it’s great.

'It is open to abuse but the review has done a lot more good than harm for us because I was able to present the hotel in a favourable light and give a flavour of what we are like here.

Family business: Mr Scrivenor, 41, runs his three-star B&B with wife Victoria, 39

'We had a young couple recently who wanted to see what the place was like because they thought the responses were so funny. It definitely attracts people.

'I’m not going to pursue the £400 because I’m not going to get it back.'

His hotel has eight rooms priced between £55 and £115 plus a pub and a restaurant.

A blurb on the hotel website reads: 'We have put an awful lot of time and passion into creating a cosy and luxurious experience for our guests.

'Each of the rooms has been given a touch of character and individuality and this is reflected in the excellent comments we have received from our guests.'

The Crags Hotel currently has an overall TripAdvisor rating of four out of five.

Classic: A scene from comedy series Fawlty Towers in which Basil, played by John Cleese, bashes a car with a branch

Earlier this month the owners of another Scottish B&B accused TripAdvisor of operating ‘above the law’ after the couple lost a bitter legal wrangle over bad reviews posted on the global travel guide.

Martin and Jacqui Clark went to court in an attempt to force the £3billion organisation to disclose details of the writers of two negative online posts so they can sue the authors.

The Clarks, who run the nine-bedroom Tigh na Cheo guest house at Kinlochleven, Inverness-shire, maintain that both reports posted within a month of each other were fabricated and malicious.

They wanted to raise an action for defamation against whoever posted the comments, claiming the poor reviews damaged their reputation and cost them business.

But their legal bid stumbled at the first hurdle when a judge at the Court of Session in Edinburgh rejected a request for a disclosure order to force TripAdvisor to reveal the names, addresses and other information on the authors’ identity.

In a judgment that could have far-reaching implications for other victims of bad reviews, Judge Paul Arthurson, QC, ruled Scots courts have no jurisdiction in the matter.
