Former Labor leader Mark Latham was dumped from a radio interview for an on-air rant that included calling Triple M host Gus Worland a 'loveable f***wit' and movie star Hugh Jackman a 'North Shore w***er.'

Now Worland wants to punch Latham's head in - for charity.

Mr Latham, who was opposition leader for 13 months from December 2003 and led Labor to lose the 2004 election, had been invited on to the station's Grill Team morning program to talk about his latest book.

The program is co-hosted by Worland, who is also known for reality TV progams including An Aussie Goes Barmy.

An audio recording had earlier emerged of Mr Latham talking to another Triple M presenter, Merrick Watts, about Worland's latest TV show, Gus Worland: Marathon Man, which document's the presenter's efforts to get fit and run the New York Marathon.

'I actually watched Gus' Marathon Man show, flicking through Foxtel one night, and hooked into it on the basis it's got to be the worst TV ever. It lived up to expectations, it was f***ing horrendous,' Latham said in the audio, which was not put to air.

'It was shocking but I couldn't work out he wasn't losing any weight, how's this fat tub going to run a marathon, they ended up shoving tubes up his a***.'

'No doubt I'll drop him like a bad habit,' Latham fired back at Worland. 'I'll knock him into tomorrow and he can whack his mate Hugh Jackman in for seconds.'

His criticisms led to The Grill Team - Worland, Mark Geyer and Matthew Johns - urging Mr Latham to come on their show and talk about his book, Latham at large.

Mr Latham did not back down from his criticism talking directly to Worland and his colleagues.

'The best s*** TV in the history of the entertainment industry,' was how Mr Latham described Worland's show.

He went on to take a swipe at Worland's previous TV efforts focusing on cricket, but left his harshest criticism for last.

'Gus, I’ve been talking to Davey Gyngell down there at Channel 9 and we’re gonna put a proposition to you, you’ve got a lot of talent ... so Gyngell and I want to make you an offer to put on a new variety show, prime time, channel ...' 

But Mr Latham was taken off air before he could finish his sentence. Co-host Johns explained why.

'He said he wanted to call the show, Gus Worland Loveable F***wit,' Johns said.

No backing out now. Social media has already lit up with news of the fight between Latham and Worland and they are already putting odds on it

 After the awkward on-air episode, Triple M said Worland wanted to take the stoush further.

Worland 'has challenged Mark Latham to a boxing match after the ex-Labor leader called him a "f***wit" live on-air,' Triple M said in a statement.

It explained the whole incident like this: 

'Latham was in to talk about his book, which Gus called "rubbish"… after the ex-Labor leader slagged of his TV show, calling it the "worst television show in the history of the media".

'This really p***** Gus off. He called him a "failed opposition leader, a failed pollie" that "even Labor don't even care" about.

Mark Latham said of Gus Worland and his best mate Hugh Jackman (pictured starring in the movie series Wolverine) 'all those north shore w*****rs', seriously, I'll knock them out of the ring'.

'He then challenged the former pollie to a boxing match for charity. Looks like someone is gonna get hurt.'

'I want to put on a boxing match,' Worland said. 'Three rounds. I’ll take him on for charity after what he said.'

'No doubt I'll drop him like a bad habit,' Latham fired back.

'I'll knock him into tomorrow and he can whack his mate Hugh Jackman in for seconds. All those North Shore wankers, seriously, I'll knock them out of the ring.'

Mr Latham ended by daring Worland to name the time and place.

Mr Latham grew up in Sydney's blue-collar south-western suburbs, and represented the area in Parliament for the seat of Werriwa. Known for a brash, sometimes abrasive personality, Mr Latham allegedly broke a taxi driver's arm in 2001 during a fare dispute and is also remembered for a quite aggressive, in-your-face, handshake with John Howard during the 2004 election campaign.
