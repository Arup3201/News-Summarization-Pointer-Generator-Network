The taxpayer is funding six-figure salaries for more than 800 officials and penpushers, it emerged today.

New
 figures reveal the scale of the bill for civil servants and quangocrats
 earning more than £100,000-a-year, despite government calls for 
austerity in public spending.

It includes three men paid more than £300,000 in a single year – double the pay of Prime Minister David Cameron.

High earners: The top 3 best paid from the public purse were Ian Nolan, from the Green Investment Bank, who earned £330,000, Shaun Kingsbury, from the Green Investment Bank, was paid £325,000 while Dennis Hone earned £310,000 as the head of the Olympic Delivery Authority

In
 an attempt to get a grip on vast pay deals in the public sector, the 
Treasury demanded that anyone earning more than Mr Cameron’s £142,500 
salary would have to be cleared by ministers.

But
 details of the earnings of senior figures across Whitehall, the NHS and
 quangos reveals hundreds continue to earn eye-watering sums.

Data released by the Cabinet Office reveals that in March 2013 there were 819 public sector workers earning more than £100,000.

The highest earner was Ian Nolan, the chief investment officer of the Green Investment Bank, who was paid £330,000.

Transparency: Cabinet Office minister Francis Maude insisted the government was making progress in curbing high pay

His boss, chief executive Shaun Kingsbury, earned £325,000 while Dennis Hone earned £310,000 as chief executive of the Olympic Delivery Authority, which he quit last year.

Among the 30 earning more than £200,000 were the chief medical officer Dame Sally Davies (£210,000), pensions regulator Stephen Soper (£210,000), NHS England boss Sir David Nicholson (£210,000) and Ministry of Defence equipment chief Bernard Gray (£220,000).

Despite the huge sums, Cabinet Office minister Francis Maude insisted the government had made progress in reining in spending.

He told the Daily Telegraph: ‘Britain is now leading the world on transparency. We have released more data than ever before and the whole point is to allow armchair-auditors to hold our feet to the fire.'

Mr Maude went on: ‘This Government is slashing costs to help the country live within its means. We have shrunk the Civil Service by 15 per cent since the 2010 General Election and it’s now at its smallest since World War Two.

‘There are a fifth fewer people earning over £150,000 and over 250 fewer quangos than there were under Labour.

‘It’s these sort of tough decisions which helped us save hard-working taxpayers £10 billion last year but there’s so much more that we need to do.’

In the past the government only published details of people earning more than £150,000 but lowered the threshold to increase pressure on government bodies to curb spending.

Dominic Raab, a Tory MP, said: 'These figures show we still have too many overpaid bureaucrats in Whitehall, many at the least efficient departments or quangos.

'As austerity continues, we should be focused on reining in Sir Humphrey's bloated pay package, to spare front line services and avoid taxes going up.

'Too often it appears that the worst performing public bodies are paying the most exorbitant salaries. It's a culture change Whitehall still needs to go through.'
