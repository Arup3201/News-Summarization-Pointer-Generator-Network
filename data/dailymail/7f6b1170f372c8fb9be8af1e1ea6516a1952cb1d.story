A Republican congressman has sparked outrage by claiming Eric Garner would not have died after an NYPD cop put him in a chokehold if he hadn't been in poor health. 

Peter King said on Wednesday that Mr Garner's asthma, heart condition and obesity were the reasons he died on Staten Island on July 17.

The New York representative's inflammatory remarks came as New York City erupted in protests on Wednesday after a grand jury decision not to indict Officer Daniel Pantaleo, 29, who grabbed Mr Garner and put him in a chokehold.

Peter King said on Wednesday that Mr Garner's asthma, heart condition and 350lb weight contributed to his death on Staten Island on July 17

King told CNN on Wednesday: 'If he [Garner] had not had asthma, and a heart condition and was so obese, almost definitely he would not have died from this.'

The politician said the cops had 'no reason' to know that Mr Garner, 43, was in danger - despite the fact the father-of-six can be heard repeatedly saying he can't breathe on the videotaped attack.

King added: 'The fact is if you can't breathe, you can't talk. If you've ever seen anyone resisting arrest, I've seen it, and it's been white guys, and they're always saying, ''You're breaking my arm, you're choking me, you're doing this'' -  police hear this all the time.'

The politician also told CNN that the attack was not racially-motivated and a 350lb white guy 'would have been treated the same'. 

King tweeted his support for the grand jury decision over the death for Mr Garner on Wednesday and offered condolences to the late father-of-six

The representative also tweeted his support for the decision on Wednesday, posting: 'Thanks to SI grand jury for doing justice & not yielding to outside pressure. Decision must be respected. Compassion for the Garner family.'

Responses to Mr King's remarks showed the depth of public anger over the grand jury decision.

@pridgen responded: 'If you only had a brain Peter King. You are a disgrace to your public office.'

Congressman King said Mr Garner would not have died if it wasn't for his size and health concerns 

Tucker Scott Atkins posted in response: 'You're a complete joke.'

sharonM tweeted: '@RepPeteKing Seriously? Not even a Misdemeanor Charge of Strangulation? What a travesty.'

However commenters on a popular police blog joined King on Thursday by supporting the grand jury decision and attacked outraged protesters, New York Mayor Bill de Blasio, President Obama, Attorney General Eric Holder and the media.

One post from VON1, on the Policeone website, read: 'Have you heard the mayor of NY press release. Wow! 35,000 cops just got b****slapped.'  

Esu5 wrote: 'Every now and then we win one. Horrible situation, man lost his life, but like in the Ferguson case he controlled his own destiny.'

The New York City ruled Mr Garner's death a homicide in August because of the compression to his neck and chest and the way he was held on the ground. 

The examiner also said that Mr Garner's health problems contributed to his death. 

The grand jury decision on Eric Garner's death came nine days after the Ferguson grand jury declined to indict Officer Darren Wilson over the fatal shooting of unarmed black teenager Michael Brown.  

The decision by the New York grand jury panel on Wednesday means that a majority of them did not think there was probable cause a crime was committed by Pantaleo, who was the only NYPD officer facing indictment. 

Two other officers at the scene were offered immunity if they testified before the grand jury. 

New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio canceled his first scheduled appearance as mayor at the Rockefeller Center tree lighting on Wednesday and addressed the city instead.

His office issued a statement calling Garner's death a 'tragedy' and a 'deeply emotional day – for the Garner Family, and all New Yorkers'.

Fearing a repeat of the riots witnessed in Ferguson, de Blasio repeated the city's commitment to non-violent protests.

'Today's outcome is one that many in our city did not want. Yet New York City owns a proud and powerful tradition of expressing ourselves through non-violent protest,' the mayor said.  

Cellphone footage from Garner's arrest, for allegedly selling untaxed, loose cigarettes, showed Pantaleo grappling with the larger man, ultimately placing his arms around his neck in a banned chokehold manoeuvre.

On the ground, Garner was clearly heard pleading, 'I can't breathe, I can't breathe' as officers handcuffed him.

He lost consciousness at the scene and was pronounced dead later that day at hospital.
