A Big Mac burger is healthier than three quarters of hospital meals, a study has revealed.

The survey, carried out by the campaign group Sustain, found that 75 per cent of NHS food contained more saturated fat that McDonald's signature burger, while 60 per cent had more salt.

In one case, a curry contained six times more fat that a KFC zinger burger with fries and on another occasion a pasta dish was found to have more than three times a person's daily recommended saturated fat intake and twice their salt limit.

The study also found that 40 per cent of meals contained more saturated fat than a 9 inch Pepperoni pizza.

Sustain's Alex Jackson said: 'It's staggering to think sick patients could be better off eating at McDonald's.

'Without standards, many meals will remain unhealthy and unappetising.'

The survey examined 25 meals from the NHS supply chain, which provides food to most hospital trusts in the UK.

Researcher Katharine Jenner told The Sun: 'Salt and saturated fat is linked to heart disease and strokes.

'Hospitals should provide tasty and healthy meals, rather than ones that could lead to more health problems.'

'Unhealthy and unappetising': Sustain wants the Government to introduce minimum food standards for NHS meals

The survey comes in the wake of MPs discussing a Transforming Hospital Food Bill in Parliament for the first time this week.

Sustain wants the Government to bring compulsory minimum food standards into the NHS.

The Department of Health said hospitals decided what food to serve.

However, it added: 'There's no excuse for any hospital offering poor quality food.'
