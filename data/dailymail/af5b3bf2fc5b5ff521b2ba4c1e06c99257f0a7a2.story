The campaign to tear Scotland out of the United Kingdom has failed to gain any ground despite the launch of the Scottish National Party’s long-awaited prospectus for independence.

An exclusive poll of more than 1100 Scots for The Mail on Sunday has revealed that only 27 per cent of voters plan to vote yes in next year’s referendum, while 56 per cent intend to vote no and 17 per cent still don’t know how they will vote.

It means that support for Scottish independence is still trailing far behind the pro-Union campaign – and remains at the same level as an identical Mail on Sunday poll carried out in September.

The poll was the first carried out since the SNP launched its ‘white paper’ on independence, which was supposed to provide details of every aspect of what an independent Scotland would look like.

As well as asking the main question that will appear on the referendum ballot paper – 'Should Scotland be an independent country?' -  the poll also found that only 23 per cent of Scots think they would be better off if Scotland went it alone.

Experts say that the findings reveal that the series of pledges unveiled by Scotland’s First Minister Alex Salmond last Tuesday have failed to have any impact on voters.

It leaves the yes camp staring at defeat with less than one year to go until the vote.

SNP leaders had described the launch of the White Paper as a ‘key moment’ in the referendum campaign and were desperate to get a pick-up in the polls from the media blitz which followed the launch of the White Paper.

Polling expert John Curtice, a research consultant at ScotCen Social Research, said: ‘There can be little doubt that the yes side will be disappointed with this result because it does not show any evidence of any measurable swing of opinion.

‘Opinion on this has proved to be so stable in the last 12 months.  All the criticism of the no side has not gone anywhere so why should we be surprised a paper by the yes side makes no difference either?

‘The yes side may say the white paper will be a slow burner but, given the intensity of the media splash following the launch, they may have hoped it would make some difference.

‘One of the reasons there has been no immediate impact is it has not immediately persuaded people that people will be better off and this is crucial.’

The Mail on Sunday’s survey, carried out by respected pollsters Progressive Scottish Opinion – the first firm to correctly predict the SNP majority victory in the 2011 Holyrood elections – is the first test of public opinion since the launch of the ‘Scotland’s Future’ document, with 1134 Scots surveyed over the course of last Wednesday and Thursday.

In an identical poll carried out by the same firm in September, 27 per cent of Scots intended to vote yes while 59 per cent intended to vote no and 14 per cent did not know how they would vote.

Despite an unprecedented push to attract female voters, who have traditionally been less supportive of independence than men, the poll shows that just 23 per cent of women intend to vote yes, while 56 per cent will vote no. The SNP had been hoping to secure an upturn in support from women after pledging to increase the amount of free childcare in an independent Scotland.

There was also a huge difference in voting intentions depending on whether people work.  Incredibly, two –thirds of unemployed people intend to vote yes, compared to just one in four of full-time workers – a clear sign that lose who have most to lose are most fearful of separation. Much of the SNP’s campaign has focused on the Westminster coalition’s welfare shake-up.

The poll also asked voters how independence would affect their own household financially – a crucial aspect of the referendum campaign since the SNP claim they will secure a yes vote if people think they will be £500 better off.

It found that just 23 per cent of people think that their household would be better off if Scotland became independent, while 49 per cent think they would be worse off and 13 per cent thought their finances would be the same – with the remainder not knowing how they would be affected.

Debate: Scotland will go to the polls to decide its future on September 18 next year

Since last Tuesday’s launch, the SNP have come under fire for failing to provide a ‘plan B’ on currency if they fail to secure a pound-sharing currency union with the rest of the UK following a yes vote, and for failing to accept the demands that other EU countries may place on them in order to grant a separate Scotland EU membership.

Alistair Darling, chairman of the pro-Union Better Together campaign, said: ‘The SNP’s manifesto for breaking up the UK completely failed to pass even the basic tests.

‘They failed to offer a plan for what currency we would use if, as seems increasingly certain, the rest of the UK say no to Scotland keeping the pound, they failed to tell us anything about how much independence would cost us and their wish list of false promises lacked any sort of price list.

‘And their claims that we could leave the UK without losing anything fell apart when the Spanish Prime Minister said that leaving the UK meant leaving the EU.

‘What was extraordinary was that the only new policy they announced was something that they could deliver now because childcare is already the responsibility of the Scottish Parliament and the SNP Government.

‘This poll confirms that Scots are choosing devolution in the UK over separation from the UK. But we cannot be complacent for one moment.’

Mid Scotland and Fife is the part of Scotland with most support for the Union, with 67 per cent of voters intending to vote no.

Surprisingly, another stronghold for the Better Together campaign is North East Scotland, where the SNP has been most successful in recent years, where 64 per cent intend to vote no and only 26 per cent intend to vote yes.

Support for the Union increases with age, with 63 per cent of the over-55s intending to vote no, compared to 42 per cent of 18-24-year-olds.

On the question of household finances, top earners were more likely to think they would be worse off in an independent Scotland – which is a clear sign that voters fear savage tax rises – with 54 per cent of those in the ABC1 social grade thinking their household would be worse off in an independent Scotland, compared to 45 per cent of people in the C2DE social grades.

Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson said: ‘We take nothing for granted and continue the fight to keep our United Kingdom together.

‘The majority of the Scottish people have seen through the empty prospectus of the white paper and have recognised it is little more than an uncosted wishlist.

‘Scotland is better off as part of one of the largest and fastest growing economies in the developed world, with a stable currency and a fully funded pensions system.

‘In stark contrast, the SNP’s White Paper featured just a single page on how a separate Scotland would be paid for, which beggars belief.’

Drew Smith, Scottish Labour's constitutional spokesman, said: ‘The SNP promised the White Paper would be a game changer but it would appear it has had no impact on the people of Scotland who just don't share the SNP's obsession with the constitution.’
