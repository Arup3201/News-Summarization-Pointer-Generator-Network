Furious: Nathalie Iannetta hit back at speculation that she only got a job advising Mr Hollande on the 2016 European football championships because the president is interested in her romantically

A sports presenter drafted in as advisor to the French government was yesterday the latest woman to be named a potential lover of the country’s bachelor president.

Nathalie Iannetta, 42, is said to have got her prestigious role thanks to her closeness to the notoriously philandering Francois Hollande, 59.

He infamously dumped his live-in-girlfriend earlier this year after being caught out cheating on her with a divorced TV actress.

Now Mr Hollande is said to have had his eye turned by the glamorous Ms Iannetta, who is married with two children to Jean-Charles Sabattier, another Canal Plus sports reporter.

But Ms Iannetta is furious at speculation that she only got a job advising Mr Hollande on the 2016 European football championships, which will be held in France, because the president is interested in her romantically.

Ms Iannetta told Paris Match magazine: ‘I’ve probably got a lot of faults but I am faithful in every way. My family, my man, my children, they are the biggest success in my life.’

She was particularly annoyed at the way Paris Match noted her resemblance to Julie Gayet, the actress whom Mr Hollande left his then first lady Valerie Trierweiler for in January.

Ms Iannetta first met Mr Hollande in a park 12 years ago, when they began talking about watching football.

They have remained in touch ever since, with Ms Iannetta suggesting that Mr Hollande turn Euro 2016 into a feelgood factor before the 2017 presidential election.

‘We mustn’t get this event wrong,’ said Ms Iannetta. ‘We must use it to modernise French football and turn it into a shop window for what France can do.’

Such words hugely appealed to Mr Hollande, whose presidency to date has been an unmitigated disaster.

The bumbling Socialist has noted how well France is doing in the World Cup in Brazil, and is hoping that there will be similar celebration in 2016.

Socialist Party sources have indicated that Mr Hollande’s bachelor status will also lead to rumours about women like Ms Iannetta, who comes from an Italian background.

‘France is used to having a first lady, and it is perfectly acceptable that people speculate about who will be the next one,’ said one party member.

Mr Hollande once lived with his current Ecology minister Segolene Royale, who is the mother of his four grown-up children, but dumped her for Ms Trierweiler.   

He also caused controversy by appointing a second woman, 45-year-old Laurence Boone, to his staff, as financial and economic adviser.

Although she is known as an expert analyst, Ms Boone has infuriated leftwingers because she worked as chief economist for Europe with Bank of America, and for Barclays Capital, where she was chief French economist.

Emmanuel Macron, a leading Socialist MP, said her appointment was a ‘two- fingered salute’ to the French left, many of whom despise the rich and wealth creation.
