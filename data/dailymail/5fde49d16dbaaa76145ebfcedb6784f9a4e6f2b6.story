Her masked face, hiding hideous burns she received when she was caught up in a bushfire during a marathon run, shocked Australia.

Now former model Turia Pitt and another runner, Kate Sanderson, who, like Miss Pitt suffered burns to more than 60 per cent of her body, are each to be awarded £300,000 as an ‘Act of Grace’.

The Western Australia Tourism Minister Dr Kim Hames said today that the money was to ‘assist in alleviating their financial stress while they explore other options.’

Miss Pitt, 24, who was working in mining engineering when she entered a marathon race in outback Australia, told an inquiry that she wasn’t even planning to enter the event because she thought the £1,000 entry fee was ridiculous.

But two weeks before the marathon on September 2 last year, she was invited by organisers to compete for free.

She was joined in the event by adventure enthusiast 36-year-old Miss Sanderson and 40 other runners who were destined to run across the parched outback Kimberley region of north west Australia.

But part-way through the race Miss Pitt and Miss Sanderson, along with two male competitors, became trapped by a bushfire in a narrow, rocky gorge.

Miss Pitt’s injuries were so bad that 
not only did she suffer burns to 64 per cent of her body, she also had 
four fingers from her left hand and her right thumb amputated.

Miss Sanderson had to have her left foot amputated, lost part of her earlobes and part of her right index finger.

They told an inquiry earlier this year they had no idea they were running into danger because the organisers had spoken only ‘in passing’ about spot fires.

Miss Pitt said she and Miss Sanderson would have died at the gorge if not for a risky rescue mission undertaken by a helicopter crew.

Announcing the state government’s decision to pay the women £300,000 each, Dr Hames said:

‘The terrible tragedy that occurred on September 2, 2011, is something with which we can all empathise.

‘But no-one can truly appreciate the pain, ,suffering and disfigurement that Miss Pitt and Miss Sanderson have endured and will continue to experience for the remainder of their lives.’

He said an ‘act of grace’ payment was appropriate for the women.

Two male runners who also received serious burns and required skin grafts will not receive compensation as their circumstances were not as ‘extraordinary’, it was decided.
