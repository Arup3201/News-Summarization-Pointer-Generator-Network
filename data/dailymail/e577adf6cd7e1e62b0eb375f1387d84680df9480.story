Alex Rodriguez is back on the market.

The New York Yankees star has called it quits with wrestler girlfriend Torrie Wilson after three years of dating.

This as many close to the couple point to Rodriguez's failure to commit and his close relationship with his ex-wife as a constant source of fighting for the couple.

Sources claim the couple had been fighting more, especially over Rodriguez's continued close relationship with ex-wife Cynthia Scurtis (above)

'Alex and Torrie would fight over his flirtations with other women, and he wasn’t ready to settle down again,' a source told Page Six.

Not making things easier for Wilson is the fact that Rodriguez has remained closed with ex-wife Cynthia Scurtis ever since their divorce, and the two are often seen out with their two daughters.

And while Scurtis is still very much involved in Rodriguez's personal life and business dealings , it seems like a reconciliation is not in the cards any time soon as the psychologist recently became engaged to another man.

Rodriguez and Wilson began dating in late 2011,  and, as in many of his past relationships with woman such as Cameron Diaz and Madonna, they were frequently spotted working out together.

Prior to Wilson, Rodriguez dated Cameron Diaz (seen above at the Super Bowl)

Despite their divorce, Rodriguez and Scurtis are frequently seen with their two daughters

The timing also seems to hint that 39-year-old Rodriguez may want to devote all his time and energy to the upcoming baseball season, with the Yankees needing to fill the huge void created by the retirement of Derek Jetter.

Making this season even more important however is the fact that Rodriguez has not played in almost two seasons, going out in 2013 following hip surgery and being suspended for the 2014 season for his involvement with Biogenesis, the Miami clinic that supplied performance enhancing drugs to players.

Wilson, 39, is reportedly staying in Los Angeles as she hopes to pursue a career in film.
