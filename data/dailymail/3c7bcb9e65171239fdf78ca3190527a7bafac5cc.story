Jaguar’s sexy new F-Type sports car hits the road for real from today – and from my exclusive first drive of it I can tell you it really
 is the cat that’s got the cream.

MailOnline took the new ‘leaping cat’ for an extraordinary and 
challenging test-drive covering more than 200 miles of twisting alpine 
roads and major highways in Navarre in Northern Spain, plus a dozen 
flat-out laps of the region’s 2.4 mile long ‘Navarra Circuit’  F1 
test-track.

The first cars will only be handed over to dealers and showrooms from this Thursday.

Automatic gear system will even  recognise when car is repeatedly overtaking - and keep it in a lower gear for added acceleration

Sexy looks matched with powerful performance and the refined balance 
and poise of a prima ballerina mean that this British-built two-seater 
roadster is set to cause a sensation – even though only 7,000 will be 
built each year.

With James Bond film producers and 007 star Daniel Craig already having a
 relationship with Jaguar Land Rover – whose vehicles featured 
prominently in their last movie Skyfall - I would not be surprised to 
see Britain’s top agent replacing his trashed Aston Martin DB5 with a 
Jaguar F-Type in the next big screen outing.

And there are other Hollywood A-listers likely to be joining him, I hear.

On looks alone the F-Type is a sight to behold thanks to beautiful and 
contemporary styling from a team led by design boss Ian Callum.

It may 
have been dubbed the spiritual successor to the legendary E-Type of the 
1960s, but this 21st century car is definitely not stuck in a time warp.

One of the neatest touches are the ‘deployable’ door handles which pop 
out when you need to open the door, but return to sit flush with the 
door once you are under way.

It’s already won the prestigious ‘World Car Design of the Year’ title.

But fire up the engine by depressing the ‘start’ button on the dash 
board and the noise of it bursting into life will really set your pulse
 racing as it roars into life ahead of a truly responsive spirited 
drive.

As pop group Slade put it: ’Come on feel the noise.’

Built at Jaguar’s Castle Bromwich plant near Birmingham, the new Jaguar 
F-Type even has an ‘active exhaust system’ which cunningly channels the 
exhaust gases and amplifies the ‘brum, brum’ sound of the revving car
 inside the cabin so you can enjoy the ‘blip, crackle and pop’ as you 
drive.

It’s the hi-tech automotive version of generations of children 
sticking playing cards into their bicycle spokes to achieve a similar 
effect, and designed to take the car to a ‘howling crescendo’. And it 
works.

Jaguar says the new F-Type has been designed to be ‘driver-focussed’ and you can’t fault it on ambition.

Jaguar says the new F-Type has been designed to be 'driver-focussed', which Ray puts to the test on the road

It delivers a spirited and engaging drive on the road, but raw 
excitement on the track. Aerospace technology has been used to keep 
the car light and rooted to the ground.

The interior is designed to resemble a cocooning fighter pilot cockpit 
with cossetting sports seats. Air vents rise up when needed – dropping 
down to remain flush with smoothly curved dashboard.

The driver can even use touch-screen controls ‘tune’ the car’s 
dynamic settings to suit his or her taste or driving style. On the road 
the car is nimble, balanced and powerful – in some cases too powerful 
for the road unless it’s the unrestricted German Autobahns. But it 
sticks to the road like glue.

On the F1 race track I have to admit it was a far better car than I am a
 performance  driver.  But even I pushed it to my limit – though nowhere
 near the F-Type’s.

There are three powerful  versions of the car: the F-Type, F-Type S and the range-topping F-Type V8 S.

Top of the range is the F-Type V8 S powered by a supercharged 495 
horse-power petrol engine, equivalent to five Ford Fiestas. It has a top
 speed of 186mph, will  accelerate from rest to 60mph in just 4.2 
seconds and costs a cool £79,950.

The V6 S (380 horse-power)  will hit 60mph in 4.8 seconds and has a top speed of 171mph and costs £67,500.

Starting price is £58,500 for the  F-Type V6 which  develops 340 
horse-power, accelerates from rest to 60mph in 5.1 seconds and has a top
 speed of 151mph.

The V6 models have a twin exhaust tail-pipe at the centre. The V8 has two pairs of twin tail-pipes.

The eight-speed ‘QuickShift’  automatic gear-box selector resembles the joy-stick of a fighter aircraft. 
  
Beautifully sculpted, it features Drive, Sport and Park modes. Sport is 
engaged with a nudge to the left and creates an even tighter drive.

The joy of gear-changing. The eight-speed 'QuickShift' automatic gear-box selector resembles the joy-stick of a fighter aircraft. Drive, Sport and park modes

For even greater driving engagement, flick the switch for ‘dynamic’ 
driving and feel the car tighten its ‘muscles’. The automatic gear 
system will even recognise when car is repeatedly overtaking – and keep
 it in a lower gear for added acceleration.

This car will do all the work for you and make you feel like a brilliant
 driver.  But F1-style paddles on the steering wheel mean  you can 
switch to manual over-ride at any time and run up and down the gears as
 you feel fit. That’s when it really gets interesting.

For a quick getaway there is a ‘dynamic launch mode’. At rest, the 
driver depresses the brake pedal while simultaneously building engine 
speed. Once a message reading ‘Dynamic launch ready’ appears in the 
instrument panel, the driver simply releases the brake pedal while 
flooring the throttle. Whoosh – you’re away.

For wind in the hair motoring – which frankly was most of the time I was
 behind the wheel - the soft-top cloth roof will open or close in just 
12 seconds and at speeds of up to 30mph.

On the minus side, boot space is limited – but big enough for two people travelling light with a toothbrush.

Three powerful petrol  engines are available: a 3.0 litre supercharged V6 (340 horse-power), a V6 S (380 horse-power)and a 5.0 litre V8 (495 horse-power)
