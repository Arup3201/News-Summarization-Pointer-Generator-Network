Recently the Duchess of Cambridge returned to work for the first time since succumbing to severe morning sickness – and in true royal style hit the ground running with a succession of appearances.

But while she looked every inch the glamorous princess on the Tuesday at an awards ceremony at the Natural History Museum, on Wednesday during an Action on Addiction gala dinner fashion watchers described her as looked rather more washed out.

Why? Is it because she was attending her third event in two days. Because she is the mother of a 15-month-old toddler? Or because she is 13 weeks pregnant with her second child? None of the above according to certain style experts, who say it is because she doesn't always choose colours that suit her complexion.

According to Colour Analysts the Duchess of Cambridge looks her best in the cool soft tones of 'summer colours', like the like the baby blue gown she wore for the Wildlife Photographer of the Year 2014 Awards Ceremony (left) whilst harsh black, like the Temperley cocktail dress she wore for a gala dinner on Wednesday (right) can make her look washed out

Colour analyst Melissa Nicholson, of Kettlewell Colours, has identified the shades that compliment Kate’s skin tone and says they are from the 'summer' palette, which means she looks her best in clothes with a blue tint rather than a yellow one.

‘It is quite obvious that Kate is a summer,’ she said. ‘I would say her best shades are French navy, airforce blue, aubergine, plum, burgundy, soft berry and grey (anything from silver to slate).

'Spring colours are too bright and playful for Kate, winter colours too overpowering and autumn colours are too heavy and boring. The summer colours accentuate her natural beauty – she looks sophisticated and elegant in cool soft tones.’

According to Melissa, people who want to look their best – like Kate – should visit a professionally-trained colour analyst, who will put swatches of fabric against your skin to find out which season you are. Certainly 'having your colours done' is the latest craze on Mumsnet.

'If you have blue tones in your skin, you are either summer or winter,’ she explains. ‘Both tend to suit the cooler, silver jewellery and colours that have a blue tint rather than a yellow tint.

'Winter can wear more intense bold colours in high contrast – black and white, dark navy, fuchsia, scarlet - while summer look better in a softer blend of colours – grey, plum, powder pink, French navy, berry tones dusted with icing sugar.

'If you have warmer, yellow tones in your skin, you are likely to be either spring or autumn. They tend to look better in gold jewellery and colours that have a yellow tint rather than a blue one.

'Autumn colours are earthier shades with a hint of black in them – browns, russets, olive greens. Spring colours, on the other hand, are brighter, fresher and more playful – yellows, corals and turquoise blues.’

From the glamorous burgundy coat chosen for her first Christmas at Sandringham to the yellow Emilia Wickstead coat worn to a Buckingham Palace garden party last summer, FEMAIL reveals the Duchess's best style hits (and a few misses) with colour analyst ratings...

10/10 LOOKING GOOD IN BLUE: Kate chose French Navy both during her 2011 visit to Quebec (left) and her engagement photocall in Novemeber 2010 (right). Expert Melissa Nicholson says: 'French navy is a cool mid-tone blue but with just the right amount of depth to give Kate a glow.’

10/10 BEAUTIFUL IN BURGUNDY: Kate looks much better in this wine colour for her first Christmas Day at Sandringham in 2011 (left) rather than the brown coat she wore in Grimsby in 2013 (right). The expert's verdict: 'Dark pink berry tones compliment her natural colouring and are sensational for Kate. The cool tones of the plum coat compliment Kate much better than the warm mahogany colour.'

9/10 GLAMOROUS IN TWEED: Kate wore this Missoni blue tweed M dress and Rachel Trevor Morgan hat when she joined the Queen and Prince Philip during the Diamond Jubilee tour . The verdict? ‘The tone-tone effect of the tweed creates a softer look and compliments Kate beautifully.’

ELEGANT IN SILVER: The Duchess wore this subtle shade for the UK's Creative Industries Reception at the Royal Academy of Arts  London in 2012 which Melissa describes as a 'winning colour on Kate'

9/10 LOOKING STUNNING IN GREYS: Kate chose this cool tone for both an  Easter Sunday service at St Andrew’s Cathedral in Sydney 2014 (left) and Emerging from the plane at LAX airport on her first overseas tour in July 2011 (right). The expert says: ‘Soft grey looks sophisticated on Kate and evens out her skin tone.’

8/10: MUTED EVENING WEAR: Kate wore a stunning dusky pink gown to a gala dinner in Kensington Palace in June 2011 (left) and a soft lilac  to a 2011 gala in LA. Melissa says: 'Soft, delicate and sheer also works well for Kate, while soft lilac is a sophisticated alternative to white.’

7/10 BEAUTIFUL IN BERRY: Kate chose a brighter shade when she visited her new portrait, hung at the National Portrait Gallery London by artist Paul Emsley in 2013 and the expert says 'Soft berry reds  are better than vibrant orange reds'

6/10: CREAM SHADES: For both the Diamond Jubilee service (left) and a dinner at Thirty Club at Claridges in May 2012  (right) Kate wore off-white. However the expert says: 'Soft white is preferable to optic white although we feel Kate needs a little more colour to look her best.’

5/10 WHITE Kate wore this  Alexander McQueen white broderie anglaise suit when visiting the Rolls Royce jet engine factory in Singapore in September 2012. What the experts say: ‘Swap optic white for a soft white or soft grey and this outfit would be a winner.’

4/10 CANDY CANE COLOURS: This Reiss £159 white Nanette engagement dress and Sylvia Fletcher at Lock & Co red hat with maple leaf which Kate wore for Canada Day celebrations July 2011. But Melissa says: ‘You see the hat first! Red and white is too contrasting for Kate.’

3/10: Melissa thinks this Ralph Lauren £350 olive green turtle-neck dress (left) 'looks heavy on Kate' . While the mint green Burberry coat (right) is ‘an uncomfortable combination of both colour and style. A grey taupe hat with an airforce blue jacket would be a better combination.’

2/10 AN EARTHY DISAPPOINTMENT : This green Emilia Wickstead coat dress with Lock & Co £245 brown ‘Betty Boop’ hat were worn by Kate  at St Patrick’s Day  2013. What the experts say: ‘The combination of brown and green are too earthy and detract from her natural style.’

1/10 YUCKY IN YELLOW: This Emilia Wickstead bespoke coat in yellow silk was worn to the Buckingham Palace Garden Party in May 2013 but Melissa says: ‘Acid yellow is harsh, bright and overbearing on Kate.’
