Samuel Eto’o believes Liverpool striker Mario Balotelli’s troubled past is behind him and has backed the mercurial Italian to make a positive impact on his return to the Premier League.

Balotelli endured an eventful three year spell at Manchester City before leaving for Serie club AC Milan in January 2013.

However Everton’s new recruit Samuel Eto’o, who was also linked with a move to Liverpool this summer, claims it’s time to stop punishing Balotelli for his past errors and thinks the striker will be a success back in the Premiership.

Debut: Samuel Eto'o scored in his first game for new club Everton during the 6-3 defeat to Chelsea on Saturday

Eto’o tried to act as a father figure to Balotelli during their season together at former club Inter Milan in 2009-2010.

He told the Sun: ‘Mario was very young at Inter but he is a person of great qualities – not only in terms of football.

‘It is only right to give him the benefit of the doubt. He is more experienced as a player and a person now and will make some very positive contributions to the Liverpool team.’

Eto’o made his Everton debut on Saturday, scoring in the 6-3 defeat to former club Chelsea, and insists Balotelli will have grown up during his time away from the Premiership:

He added: ‘Lots of people make errors in their young life which are later corrected and I would think Mario has done some growing up as a player and as a person.’

Balotelli is set to make his much anticipated Liverpool debut on Sunday against Tottenham.
