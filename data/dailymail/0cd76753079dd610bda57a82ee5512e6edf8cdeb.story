A man opened fire in his home in the early hours of Thursday morning, killing his daughter and himself and seriously wounding his wife and son. The family beagle was also killed.

James Edwards, 52, and his daughter Laurin Edwards, 19, died from gunshot wounds in the family home on Winterset Drive in Allegheny County, Pittsburgh.

Edwards' wife, Charlene, 51, and son, Jimmy, 21, were taken to Allegheny General Hospital and are listed in a critical condition.

Police told WTAE that James Edwards went 'from room to room' shooting his family members before turning the gun on himself.

Police found Laurin Edwards with two gunshot wounds to the torso and her father dead of a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the chest in the hallway of the home.

According to the Post-Gazette, Charlene Edwards was found on the patio and her son Jimmy was in his bedroom. Both had been shot twice.

Charlene Edwards managed to call 911 to report her husband's rampage from inside the house around 3:10am.

Jimmy Edwards was playing an online Xbox game when the shootings occurred, and someone who heard the shooting through the video game also dialed 911.

According to WTAE, the family had that night celebrated Laurin Edwards' 19th birthday.

Police investigators are searching for a motive in the horrific 
shooting, but so far there has been little to indicate a reason for the 
crime.

'There were no journals, diaries or other writings found to lead to a clear explanation,' said Lieutenant Schurman of the Allegheny police department.

According to WTAE, James Edwards was an electrician at Pittsburgh International Airport until he was suspended from the job last Friday.

Airport officials have refused to comment on Edwards' employment situation except to express sympathy and condolences for the Edwards family and say that as of Friday, Edwards still had a job at the airport.

Police are uncertain as to whether his job situation may have fueled the rampage.

Neighbors said that although there were no obvious signs of trouble at the home, they sensed Edwards was 'stressed' 

'Well, there were some conflicts, I'll say that. Conflicts with the 
women across the street, the people next door. Conflicts,' neighbor
Ruth Duerstein told WTAE.

'Just when we got to thinking that maybe he'd gotten 
help or whatever - it seemed to be going better for him - and this 
horrible thing.'

Neighbors told WTAE that Charlene Edwards works as a patient care technician in a nearby hospital, while Jimmy Edwards is a pharmacy student at Duquesne University.

Laurin Edwards was also a university student, studying to be a physician's assistant at St Francis University.

She was a member of the Phi Lambda Psi sorority on campus, where a candle will be burnt in her honor all week.

One of her sorority sisters, Courtney Zajdel, wrote in an email to the Post-Gazette: 'Laurin was one of those people that could take any situation you were going through and make you smile. She lit up a room when she walked in, and she was one of my biggest support systems. She was a beautiful person and now she is a beautiful Angel.'

Neighbors and friends are still struggling to comprehend Thursday's events.

'It’s a tragic situation. The family is a good family. The 
kids were absolutely perfect. You couldn’t ask for better kids. And 
smart. Both are in the National Honor Society through high school and 
college,' neighbor Linda Behrhorst said.

'We are really shook up over 
this.'
