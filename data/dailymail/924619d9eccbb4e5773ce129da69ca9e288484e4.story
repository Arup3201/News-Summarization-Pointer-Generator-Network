A New York subway train went the wrong way down the tracks earlier this month, the city's transport authority has revealed. 

The terrifying mistake has led to a subway operator and conductor being taken out of service while an investigation is carried out, the Metropolitan Transport Authority (MTA) said on Tuesday.

Officials said the uptown A train pulled out of the Canal Street hub onto downtown tracks on August 11. The crew apparently did not hear a dispatcher's radio warning.

The operator stopped after seeing another train's headlights at the next stop, West 4th Street. 

The Metropolitan Transportation Authority said there was no danger because the oncoming train had been halted.

The MTA says there had been signal problems, and the operator had been told to back up and switch to the other track. Instead, she kept going.

The MTA said a wrong-way train is 'extremely uncommon'.

CBS said that the risky situation occurred when the train was rerouted due to signal problems, CBS reported.
