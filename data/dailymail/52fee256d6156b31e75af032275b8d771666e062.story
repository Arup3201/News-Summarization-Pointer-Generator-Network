It all started with a Chihuahua named Bandit who was left chained to a fence. 

And now almost 10 years on, Anthony Rubio's rescue mission has developed into a fashion empire - strictly for dogs. 

Mr Rubio credits his extensive array of designs to studying womenswear design and being inspired to create fancy dress outfits for his rescue dog after he noticed the animal appeared to like clothes.

Anthony Rubio has created a range of bespoke designs for dogs after being inspired when he rescued a dog

From here Anthony Rubio Designs blossomed into a range of couture outfits for both male and female dogs of any breed and size, including elaborate capes and intricately decorated tuxedos. 

Mr Rubio rescued the Chihuahua, who he later named Bandit, after he spotted him chained to a fence in 2005.

'A year later after I rehabilitated him I found he liked clothes,' said Mr Rubio, of New York. 

'I had studied womenswear design a lifetime ago and wouldn't you know how handy that came in.

Capes are made for male and female dogs and Mr Rubio also creates hats and tuxedos for other animals 

Some of the capes are more intricate than others and prices range from £127 to more than £3,000 per outfit

'One Halloween I created an elaborate costume for him as Elvis and he not only won, he was front page of the newspaper the next morning and a book cover.

'I could have continued to design costumes but I chose to create my own niche and coined the title 'Pet Couturier' to stand out from other designers.'

All his designs are bespoke handmade pieces and require meticulous fitting and attention to detail. 

Mr Rubio was inspired to create his bespoke dog clothing business after his chihuahua liked wearing clothes

The designer used some of the skills he learned during a womenswear course to create technical details 

Outfits are made to order and some owners even ask Mr Rubio to include material from their wedding dress

The price of the outfits depends on the type of material used, as well as how many gems are added onto them

The designer said price is usually not an issue for clients who ask for a variety of materials to be incorporated

His works, which range from the simpler patterned pink capes to elaborate head pieces and shimmering tuxedos, range in price from £127 to £3,200.

Mr Rubio added: 'The sky is the limit with cost because it all depends on the materials that I use as well as how much work I must put into that garment.

'Price is not really that big a concern for my clients.

'I have had clients ask me to apply jewels or use the fabric from a wedding dress so anything can be possible.'
