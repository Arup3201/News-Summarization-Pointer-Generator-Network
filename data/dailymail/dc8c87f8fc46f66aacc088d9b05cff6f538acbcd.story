Missing: Miller Redpath, 18, above, vanished from his home on August 13, sparking the police investigation which led to the discovery of the body yesterday

Police have admitted that a body found in an overgrown rear garden at the home of missing public schoolboy Miller Redpath is likely to be his decomposed remains.

A post mortem on the body by a Home Office pathologist has been unable to determine the cause of death which is still being treated by police as unexplained.

The 18-year-old disappeared from his home almost two months ago have found a body in the property’s overgrown back garden.

He was last seen by his mother Anastasia Miller at their house on August 13.

Ms Miller woke him up in the morning so they could attend an open-air Christian service together but found him ‘grumpy’ in bed and left without him.

When accountant Ms Miller returned home, she found items missing from their detached Victorian home in Wenhaston, in Southwold, Suffolk, and her son gone.

But she said she was not immediately worried because he had a habit of ‘making unannounced departures’.

However, when he failed two days later to pick up his A-level results from £21,105-a-year Langley School, in Loddon, Norfolk, where he was a weekly boarder, she was more concerned.

On August 16, she reported the theft to police and mentioned her son’s disappearance.

Officers searched the house and garden but failed to find anything.

It was only on October 15 that police formally recorded the teenager as a missing person after Mrs Miller, 56, and officers investigating the theft raised concerns.

Police carried out a second search nine days later, on Thursday afternoon, and found a body in the ‘overgrown rear garden’ at the family’s ivy-covered home.

Crime scene: The family home of Miller Redpath and Anastasia Miller is now the scene of a police investigation as they try to identify the decomposed corpse

The death is being treated as ‘unexplained’ by police and the house and garden – which is largely hidden by trees and bushes – have been cordoned off while the area is examined by crime scene officers.

A Suffolk police spokesman said  a post-mortem examination will  take place to confirm whether or not the body is that of the missing teenager.

Questions could now be raised about the initial police search and why there was a nine-day gap between Miller being reported missing and the second search.

A spokesman for Suffolk Police confirmed the matter had been referred to the IPCC.

Plea: Miller's mother has been appealing for any information on her son's whereabouts since his disappearance ten weeks ago

During a press conference last week, 
Mrs Miller recalled how she began to worry when she realised her son had
not taken his passport, bank cards, phone charger, a jacket or any 
money.

She spoke to the 
local media to plead for information from anyone who had seen him and 
distributed pictures of the teenager around the town.

Appealing directly to Miller last week she said: ‘I’m really worried about your safety and well-being and I just hope that everything’s okay.

‘If you’re in trouble in any way, just remember there’s very little that can’t be sorted out with some goodwill, negotiation and a humble heart.

Investigation: Police were searching the house as part of the missing person investigation

Ambitious: Miller was said to be thinking about going to university in London after taking A Levels at co-educational Langley School in Loddon, Norfolk

Appeal: Miller's mother Anastasia, has led the search for her son, issuing appeals in the local media

'You’re certainly not in any trouble with me. I just need you to get in touch.’

Mrs Miller, who runs an estate agency
in Eastern Europe, also trawled the streets of Ipswich and Norwich 
looking for any sign of her son and speaking to homeless people to ask 
if they had seen him.

She
said before the discovery of a body: ‘There’s a cold dark place in my 
heart that I’ve got to keep pushing back so that I can focus on the hope
that he’s alive and we’ll see him again.’

She added: ‘Everything was on track for him as he was doing well at school, he was thinking of London University, had lots of friends and I just don’t understand what happened.’

Suffolk Police said last week that they believed Miller had left the house ‘of his own free will’, but that there were ‘concerns for his well-being’.

The teenager was a keen singer and a member of the Waveney Light Opera’s Rising Stars group in  Beccles, Suffolk.

The group’s chairman, Chris Steed, said Miller was ‘a bit of a loner’ but ‘always reliable … extremely polite and well thought of by everyone’.

He added: ‘I am gutted about the discovery of this body. We have got a meeting of our group tonight and I will be stuck for words.’
