For 36 years Circus Oz has captivated audiences in a world of fantasy through their  comical performances of incredible craftsmanship.

Circus barriers were broken down when two already well-known Australian groups - Soapbox Circus and the New Ensemble Circus - came together and founded Circus Oz in 1977.  

They developed unique play and group creativity, extraordinary physicality and a playful relationship between spectator and performer. The Australian performance group's first act was in 1978.

What separated Circus Oz from other circus acts was their contemporary performances, including cabaret, popular music, comedy, movement, visual and music theatre and physical performance.  

David Carlin, Professor Associate at the School of Media and Communication has worked with Circus Oz for four years on an interactive exhibition that includes never-seen footage.

He said there is a real unique attitude that is projected by the performers in Circus Oz. 

 'The performers are doing extraordinary things but what is really amazing is there is a real connection with the audience,' Mr Carlin, told Daily Mail Australia.

'There is a sense of real people and closeness that is established - the audience really cares about what they [performers] are doing and who they are.'

Circus Oz has performed on every continent and tens of thousands have flocked to see their artistic performances.

'The sense of humour is an important part of what they do. Sometimes it is a bit bent, satirical or has a political bite and other times it is really wacky and silly. It has a nice combination of being able to not take themselves too seriously,' Mr Carlin said. 

Each show crosses boundaries as acrobats walk on tight-ropes, play with fire, jump from high ceilings and swing from the roof top. Bright coloured lights and eccentric costumes are used to tell their unique fantastical story.

'Circus is the theatre of the impossible and Circus Oz has always approached the impossible in its own irreverent way,' said Mr Carlin. 

Now the 'Vault' of Circus Oz will be unlocked with the release of rarely-seen footage  at the Melbourne Festival.

'Vault sets out to embody this spirit of playfulness within the form of its displays,' Mr Carlin said.

'There will be lots of different things for different people to discover. For some it will be the spectacle of the beauty and grace of seeing bodies doing amazing things - which is what circus is all about.'  

The 'Vault' is presented by Melbourne Festival in association with RMIT University and the Circus Oz Living Archive and will be free to the public from October 10 to October 26.

Circus Oz performers go above and beyond to captivate audiences - as teams of acrobats play with rings of fire

Robyn McGregor from Circus Oz said, 'Contortionist Sosina Wogayehu (pictured, right) came up with an idea to contort in a clear box that could be filled with popcorn. A few years later, after practicing in her bath at home, Sosi was able to perform the contortion underwater. The box was converted to hold liquid and in this version Nicci Wilks (pictured, left) returned to Circus Oz and played 'the shortest, fattest, loudest woman in the world' whilst Sosi performed her daring underwater contortion act' 

 The performances are built on teamwork rather than individual stars, as acrobats work together to entertain audiences through innovative craftsmanship

Robyn McGregor  said, 'Circus Oz contains nothing but 100% human animals, but that’s never stopped us from taking on the guise of various creatures from the animal kingdom. Most recognisably Australian, completely iconic and extending back to the beginning of Circus Oz are the red kangaroos who have created chaos and humour around the globe. Not to be contained to the stage the red kangaroos have been photographed in various locations including Times Square New York, Plazo Mayor Madrid and Calton Hill Edinburgh'
