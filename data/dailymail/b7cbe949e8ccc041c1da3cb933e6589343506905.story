One can imagine the funeral. ‘Mad’ Frankie Fraser, who died yesterday a fortnight short of his 91st birthday, will be given the type of reverential gangland send-off that South London and the East End pride themselves upon — plumed horses, ostentatious floral displays and the streets lined with people bidding farewell to a ‘legend’.

Yet the word ‘thug’ — or even ‘psychopath’ — does not do complete justice to the brutal nature of this man who was known as an ‘enforcer’, meting out violence on behalf of the Richardson gang in the Sixties.

Typical of the obsequies paid to him by those who glamorised his murderous career can be found on the website madfrankiefraser.co.uk, where he was described (before his death) as ‘one of the great continuing criminal links with the last century’. Sickeningly, the site elevates him to the status of some sort of precious historical artefact.

‘Frank’ — he was never called ‘Frankie’ by his acolytes because it was deemed insufficiently respectful — was a ‘cell-mate and partner in crime to racecourse swindlers, train robbers and racketeers. He was quaffing beers with old man Charlie Kray while the Twins were still in primary school.’

Summing up his criminal career, it added: ‘Frank has been a contract strong arm, club owner, club minder, company director, Broadmoor inmate, fire-bomber, prison rioter but — first and last — a thief. 26 convictions, 42 years inside.’

The site should have added that Fraser was an astonishingly stupid man — having been caught so often he spent more than half his adult life in prison. Even so, he managed to get married once and have four sons. Only one boy never went to jail.

Outside prison, Fraser was the sort of gangster who, in popular culture, is associated with the Swinging Sixties (though he was fortunate not to end up swinging in a more literal way, at the end of a rope, since capital punishment was abolished in 1965).

In a sick comment on our age, he inspired modern films by directors such as Guy Ritchie that revelled in the pornography of London gang violence.

Fraser’s one redeeming feature was that he did not attempt to explain away his criminal behaviour. In his autobiography, he stated that there were ‘no excuses’ since both his mother and father were ‘honest, hard-working people’.

Born in 1923, he grew up in a South London neighbourhood full of criminals. It was there he acquired the habit of stealing, helped by his sister, who also became a professional thief. ‘You name it, we nicked it,’ he once said.

When World War II came, and men of Fraser’s age were eager to serve the country as soon as they could, he feigned illness to avoid being called up to the front line.

‘The war was wonderful, thieving wise, gangster wise, for everything . . . I’ll never forgive Hitler for surrendering’.

Fraser was jailed for 10 years in 1967 for his part in the Richardson gang, where he tortured people by pulling out their teeth with pliers if they were disloyal

It was during the war that Fraser was first jailed — as he noted years later: ‘I don’t regret one moment in my life. If I have any regrets at all, it was getting caught.’

In due course, he was called up, deserted, was sent to Borstal for shop-breaking and then, shortly after his release, was convicted and sent to Wandsworth Prison.

His propensity for mindless violence — the aspect of his character his admirers seem most to enjoy — manifested itself early on.

Though not particularly tall, he was tough, physically fit, and learned early on he could get his way and command ‘respect’ by using violence. He particularly enjoyed assaulting prison staff.

In the days before the abolition of judicial corporal punishment, this could have painful consequences. For example, in Borstal, he was birched for such an offence, and in adult prison, later on, was given the cat o’nine tails twice.

Fraser boasted that he beat up the public executioner, Albert Pierrepoint, in Wandsworth in 1953 on the day he hanged Derek Bentley — the teenager executed for his part in the murder of a police constable.

Fraser said: ‘Sure I was violent, but only to people like myself.’

‘I suppose I ranked high,’ he bragged about his place in the world of criminality. ‘I’m quite proud of that.’

Serving time in Pentonville for a raid on a jeweller’s shortly after the war, his behaviour became so uncontrollable he was certified insane: his ‘Mad Frankie’ nickname was not the product of exaggeration.

Fraser dated Marilyn Wiseby, daughter of the Great Train Robber, Tommy Wiseby, for a number of years

Between serving prison sentences for bank robberies in the early Fifties, he acted as bodyguard to the notorious London gangster Billy Hill, the so-called ‘Boss of the Underworld’ — carrying out razor attacks on victims for £50 a time.

Back in prison in 1954, this time in Durham, Fraser was certified insane again and sent to Broadmoor. Surprisingly, he turned into a model inmate and secured a reasonably early release — only to celebrate his freedom by leading a violent attack on a rival gangster, Jack Spot, and his wife, for which he received another seven years.

Free again in the early Sixties, Fraser was on the periphery of the Great Train Robbery gang but worked regularly for Charlie Richardson, one of the Krays’ great rivals. Even by Fraser’s standards, the violence became extreme. Having set up a pub fruit machine enterprise as a cover for his crimes, he was accused of the shot-gun murder of another gangster, Billy Hart, in 1966. But a witness changed his evidence at the last minute and charges were dropped.

The following year, though, he was convicted at the Old Bailey of torturing men who had been ‘disloyal’ to the Richardsons. Victims had their teeth pulled out with pliers. They were also given electric shocks, whipped and burned. Fraser got ten years in jail.

While in Parkhurst, in 1969, he was one of the leaders of the notorious riots there. With the cat o’nine tails abolished, the usual punishment for his assaults on authority was the loss of remission on his time served — hence his almost permanent absence from the streets of London from the mid-Sixties until the Eighties, by which point he was an old man.

Frankie Fraser (pictured in 2012) died yesterday at 90

After Fraser’s release in the Eighties, he met the daughter of Great Train Robber, Tommy Wisbey — and they were together until 2001.

Even after reaching pension-age, Fraser was no stranger to crime. In 1991, he was shot in the head outside a North London club, but refused to name his assailant — though he mischievously dropped hints a policeman was responsible.

And only last year, aged 89 and living in sheltered accommodation, he had an Asbo served on him after a violent altercation with a neighbour.

But he spent much of his old age in a cynical and manipulative attempt to turn himself into a celebrity — something that was assisted by the parade of writers and TV documentary-makers who beat a path to his door to chronicle the story of his amoral and vicious life. By managing to outlive almost everybody else from the supposed ‘golden age’ of gangland crime, Fraser achieved the fame and adulation he so craved.

He was invited to play cameo roles on radio, television and in a number of gangster films. In 1999, he launched a one-man show — An Evening With Mad Frankie Fraser — that toured the country, a highlight of which was when he told his audience how he preferred the cat o’nine tails to the birch because it was ‘more manly’.

He touted his memoirs and gave conducted tours of London’s gangland. ‘Honest, hard-working people were safe, women were untouchable,’ he proclaimed.

His purpose was to foster the malign notion that there is such a thing as a ‘good, honest criminal’. To anyone with an ounce of morality, such thinking — sadly taken up by so many film-makers and writers — is as repugnant as it is absurd.
