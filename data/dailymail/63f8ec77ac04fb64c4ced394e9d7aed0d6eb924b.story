Two brothers who masterminded a £244,000 fraud from their council house bedroom have been jailed for a total of 10 years.

Shilu Miah, 31, and his sibling Dulu Miah, 26, used confidential information passed on from a bank 'insider' to steal elderly and vulnerable people's life savings from 218 accounts.

The criminals spent most of the cash from the 12-month scam on luxury holidays, cars and designer clothes, including Louis Vuitton flip flops ' to the tune of £1,000 a pair', Blackfriars Crown Court heard.

The brothers also went on shopping sprees at Selfridges and Harrods as well as drinking champagne at nightclubs in London's West End.

Victims had been conned after the fraudsters telephoned them pretending to be from their bank.

After speaking on the phone and getting vital details such as a pin number, a taxi was sent to the victim’s house to pick up the bank card and deliver it to the gang.

As well as dressing in Ralph Lauren clothes , Dulu Miah enjoyed two sunshine trips to Miami at his victims' expense, booking an ocean-room at the Ritz Carlton on one of his lavish breaks.

Judge Aidan Marron, QC, said the brothers had not shown a 'morsel of remorse' as he jailed them.

The judge said they had resorted to making 'sinister threats' to persuade their elderly victims, aged in their 80s and 90s, from Camden, north London, to hand over bank cards and details.

Judge Marron told them: 'You clearly had some access to private and confidential bank information, because the information with which you were armed to incite this conspiracy could only have come from the confidential files in a bank.

'The conspiracy lasted for about 12 months, involving about 220 different cases and the loss in the region of a quarter of a million pounds was occasioned.'

They used their parents' council home in King's Cross as the nerve centre of their fraud.

Shilu Miah even set up a bogus 0845 number at their house from which at least 218 victims were called by men posing as bank staff.

The targets were conned into handing over vital details such as PIN numbers to the fraudsters. A taxi was then sent to the victims' homes to pick up the card and deliver it to the gang.

The cards were then used to either siphon cash out of the person's account or open up a loan.

Police launched a string of raids on July 5 last year to smash the complex crime ring after carrying out a huge investigation.

Detectives found confidential bank documents stashed behind the steering wheel of a flash £7,500 BMW belonging to former bus driver Shilu.

The complex fraud of the type carried out by the Miah brothers has been troubling police for some time.

Conmen posing as bank staff, fraud investigators or even police telephone their elderly and vulnerable targets, convince them that their bank accounts have been compromised and persuade, and sometimes threaten, the victims into handing over sensitive information such as their PIN.

A courier, often an unwitting minicab driver, is sent round to the victims address to collect the card before the fraudsters plunder the target's bank accounts for thousands of pounds.

More than 100 people in Camden, London, have been stung so far to the tune of £1million and the fraud is still continuing.

A Hampstead actor and Primrose Hill artist's bank accounts have been raided and former MEP William Hopper had £1,000 stolen from his account late last year.

Cops also seized expensive Louis Vuitton, Ralph Lauren and Gucci designer clothes, an enormous hoard of perfume and electrical goods in the brothers' shared bedroom, along with £14,000 in Shilu's safe.

Shilu Miah, who was jailed for manslaughter in 2002, was found guilty of conspiracy to commit fraud and convicted of being in possession of criminal property after a week-long trial. He was jailed for six years.

His younger brother Dulu was jailed for four years and three months after he admitted one count of conspiracy to commit fraud.

The scam, known as 'courier fraud', is still rife in Camden, with more than 100  cases reported to police every week.

Det Ch Supt Richard Tucker, based in Camden, said after the brothers were jailed: 'These men committed a calculated and ruthless series of frauds to fund their lavish lifestyle.

'They had absolutely no regard for their victims, demonstrated by the fact that they not only took their victims' lifesavings without batting an eyelid but then even taunted and verbally abused some of them.

'These sentences reflect the importance we, the police, and the criminal justice system attach to this cold-hearted crime, and our determination to bring the callous perpetrators to account.

'I urge the public to remember this simple rule "the banks and the police will never ask for your PIN or bank card, so do not give it to them.'

Det Insp Paul Whatmore, of Scotland Yard's Fraud Squad, said: 'This is a great result for the Camden officers who were quite rightly commended for their work by the trial judge.

'Hopefully, these are just the first of many such results as we seek to curb this truly distasteful crime.'
