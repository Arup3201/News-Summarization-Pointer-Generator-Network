A knife-wielding homeless man allegedly stormed ABC's Times Square studio threatening to kill 'Good Morning America' co-host Michael Strahan yesterday.

Andre Johnson, 25, allegedly tried to stab a security guard with a serrated knife near the show's New York City set about 8am, before being tackled by a police officer.

When questioned by cops, Johnson said: 'I was there to kill Michael Strahan.'

Strahan, a former New York Giants defensive end, joined the GMA team part-time in April and also co-hosts 'Live! with Kelly and Michael' with Kelly Ripa.

New York Daily News reported security staff told Johnson to leave when he first demanded to see Strahan but he returned later with a blade.

When he threatened security workers, a police officer working in the network's security detail knocked the knife from Johnson's hand, according to the New York Post.

Johnson was swiftly arrested and taken to the Midtown South police station where he allegedly told investigators he wanted to kill Strahan.

A studio source told The Post that Strahan, a former NFL star, was not in danger or aware of the 
incident until later in the afternoon. Members of the public were not affected.

'An individual lunged at one of our employees and was heroically tackled by a police officer,' ABC News' Heather Riley told The Wrap.

'We understand the man was taken in for psychiatric evaluation. It was a scary situation but thanks to the fast actions of NYPD the situation was quickly under control. Michael was never in any danger.'

It's not known why Johnson allegedly threatened Strahan.

Johnson was charged with attempted assault as a felony, menacing and criminal possession of a weapon. He was awaiting arraignment in Manhattan Criminal Court Tuesday night.

A clerk told The Post Johnson has several out-of-state warrants and was likely to be held without bail.

Good Morning America attracts dozens 
of tourists and fans seeking to catch a glimpse of the program broadcast live from Times Square on weekday mornings.

Strahan, 42, played defensive end for the New York Giants for 15 years until 2008 and will be enshrined in the Pro Football Hall of Fame next month.
