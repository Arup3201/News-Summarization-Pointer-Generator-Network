The gang of bikers who were filmed beating up a SUV driver had allegedly intimidated and terrorized people on a previous rides.

A new video has emerged of a dozens of motorcyclists attacking car drivers, riding through red lights and even speeding along the sidewalk.

The latest footage was reportedly uploaded by the same motorcyclist who posted the shocking clip of driver Alexian Lien being beaten by an angry group of riders.

The footage of the groups - some of them masked - may be linked to the attack on SUV driver Alexian Lien

At least six bikers assaulted Lien after he accidentally ran over a fellow biker when the group started riding aggressively.

In the latest video to emerge, the gang are filmed on a helmet camera speeding along the sidewalk, seemingly not caring if anyone was walking nearby.

The three-minute clip also shows them riding through red lights, accelerating on the wrong side of the road and speeding over a garage forecourt in Ridgewood, New York.

In scenes reminiscent of the Lien video, a group of riders is also seen getting into an altercation with a car driver.

About four riders surround the Prius and hit the window and wing mirror before moving on.

It has not been confirmed whether the riders from the two videos are the same group, but in both motorcyclists are seen wearing biker jackets with diamond designs on the back.

Street FX Motorsport & Graphics, which first highlighted the video, claim it was uploaded to the same YouTube account as the Lien video.

However, it was later removed after attracting criticism.

The website wrote about the footage: 'We have all no doubt seen the Range Rover episode that we posted a few days back...What the bikers DIDN'T want you to see, is that they make a habit of these deliberate intimidation techniques year after year.'

The footage emerged two days after the New York Police Department released pictures of a third man wanted in connection with the Lien road rage assault.

Reginald Chance, 38, who police say is the biker seen in a video smashing his helmet against Lien’s SUV and yanking him out of the vehicle, came forward Friday night along with 35-year-old Robert Sims - who was shown in the video stomping on the driver's head.

Both Mr Chance and Mr Sims have been charged 
with attempted assault, gang assault and criminal possession of a 
weapon, according to the New York Post.

The video shows a biker stamping on Lien's head, as well as punching and kicking him in front of his terrified wife and two-year-old daughter.

Mr Lien suffered two black eyes, as well as cuts on his face requiring stitches, according to a criminal complaint.

'The defendant is clearly seen stomping on [Lien’s] head,' assistant district attorney Joshua Steinglass told Manhattan Criminal Court Judge Diana Boyar during Saturday arraignment.

A $100,000 cash bail was set.

It has been reported this week that at
least five off-duty cops witnessed the beating of Mr Lien, who was driving an SUV on the Henry Hudson Parkway last Sunday 
with his family inside.

The incident left Lien needing stitches and motorcyclist Edwin Mieses Jr possibly paralyzed.

Among the officers reportedly riding in the biker rally were at least two detectives and three other officers who did little to stop the attack.

One of the detectives, the undercover narcotics agent, watched as the
violence broke out and chose not to break it up for fear of ruining his
cover.

Dayana Mejia, the partner of Edwin Mieses Jr, said: 'He is the best father I know.

'To learn that he almost died and that he may not walk again- that is all still sinking in.

'It tears me up that anyone could think that Edwin in anyway deserves what happened to him.'

Mr Mieses was one of dozens of bikers who rode alongside a black Range Rover on Manhattan's West Side Highway last weekend until a biker slowed down and the vehicles bumped, police said.

Video captured at the scene shows the SUV surrounded by helmeted riders.

In the video, one rider approaches the vehicle and peers into the driver's side window.

Police said others tried to damage the SUV before the driver, Mr Lien, took off and plowed over Mieses.

The
bikers then chased after Mr Lien and smashed his car window with their 
helmets, then pulled him from the SUV and beat him to the point where he
required stitches.

Rosalyn Ng, Mr Lien's wife, said in a prepared statement that
her family's sympathies go out to Mr Mieses, but that they had to flee a 
dangerous situation.

Mr Ng said her husband was trying to protect her and their two-year-old child, who was also in the car at the time.

Mr Mieses, from Lawrence, Massachusetts, suffered a broken spine, fractured
ribs, a punctured lung and a torn aortic valve, according to Ms
Allred, who said during a press conference that his injuries may have left him paralyzed.

'He is the best father I know,' Dayana Mejia, Mieses' longtime partner, said at a Friday press conference

'He told everyone to move on and go back to riding, and turned his back to the SUV to start walking back to his own bike,' Allred said.

'It was then, with his back to the SUV, and as he was in front of it, that he was run over and crushed,' the attorney added.

A difficult situation has been made worse by what she described as a 'perception' that some people have about the riders who participated in the rally on Sunday, said Ms Mejia

'They are not gang members. They are not thugs,' Mr Mejia said.

'They are FedEx drivers, plumbers, military reservists, musicians. They are fathers and brothers and sons, and sisters and mothers.'

She also said Mr Mieses, the father of her children, didn't know any of the people he was riding with on Sunday aside from one friend who traveled to New York with him.

The potentially paralyzed biker was recently arrested in Andover, Mass., for driving with a revoked license. He also never applied for a motorcycle license.

Lien needed stitches after he was attacked by bikers in New York on Sunday as he tried to protect his wife and child. He hit some bikers in a bid to escape them but they caught up and beat him
