Wayne Rooney has been unveiled as the new England captain.

The 28-year-old Manchester United skipper succeeds Steven Gerrard after the Liverpool star retired from international duty following England's disappointing World Cup campaign in Brazil.

Lampard, England's vice-captain at last summer's World Cup where the Three Lions failed to win a game, also announced his retirement earlier this week.

Moving forward: Wayne Rooney has been handed the England captaincy by manager Roy Hodgson 

Leading from the front: Rooney has been named Manchester United captain by Louis van Gaal 

Rooney has already captained England and was handed the armband for the first time in their World Cup qualifier against San Marino in October 2012. 

'Wayne is an obvious choice for his honesty, commitment to the cause, his experience, the fact he has already captained England in the past,' Roy Hodgson said.

'Now of course he's got that responsibility at Manchester United as well. All those factors weighed into my thought process and I'm pleased to be able to say I've been able to offer it to him. I had a long conversation with him and he's prepared to accept the pressures the England captaincy brings.'

Asked if he expected the move to spur Rooney on to even greater heights, however, Hodgson demurred.

'I try to shy away from that,' he said.

'I think it's dangerous to demand that of people. We see so often in the past it takes you on to a new level but with 95 caps and all the goals he's scored, all the things he's done, we've already seen he's prepared to take responsibility.

'We hope he continues to push on, he continues to play well and he shoulders the responsibility of the captaincy as well as the other captains before him.'

Rooney told thefa.com: 'To be named as England captain is a dream come true for me personally and of course my family,

'It is something that I will take massive pride in doing.

'As a kid I always loved watching a big England game on the television. Back then I had a burning ambition to play for my country. To be appointed captain is beyond my wildest dreams.

'I would obviously like to thank Roy and the coaching staff for having the belief and confidence in me to do the job.'

Passing it on: Roy Hodgson was left in no doubt that Rooney was the right man to lead the new England 

Rooney was backed for the job by predecessor Gerrard, and will consult his fellow Liverpudlian before getting stuck into his new task.

'I intend to speak with Steven about different aspects of the role,' Rooney said.

'We had a great relationship from the moment we played together for our country and right up to our final game in Brazil. I am sure if ever I need to seek his advice he will be there to help.'

Rooney has had disciplinary problems in the past, but Hodgson said he had not concerned himself with those issues.

'I've got to judge him on the two years I've been with him,' Hodgson said. 'It's not for me to look back too much into the past and whatever misdemeanours the player may have had.

'In the two years with me I've had no reason whatsoever to question anything about his character or desire to play for his country or his wholehearted willingness to offer himself in every situation.

'I'm not concerned about anything else but he has that baggage with him and he will have to accept that as an added part of the pressure. You can't draw a line under the past.'

Moving on: Steven Gerrard relinquished the captaincy when he retired from international football
