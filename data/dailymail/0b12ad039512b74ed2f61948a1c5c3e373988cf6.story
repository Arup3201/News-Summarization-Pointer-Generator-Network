This salty sea dog has taken her love of the ocean to new depths - after exploring life under the waves in a yellow submarine made by her owner.

West Highland terrier Molly has become a frequent passenger aboard the £750,000 semi-submersible craft MSV Explorer designed by her owner Chris Garner. 

Mr Garner, chief executive of his own concept design company, spent 35,000 hours perfecting the two-seater underwater vessel.

The pair are now often spotted taking trips along the Cornwall coastline in the specially designed craft. 

Mr Garner, 59, said: 'Molly knew what the sub was all about as she’s been with me all through the various stages.

'She’s often seen it in the factory and Molls always seems to wag her tail when it’s mentioned.'

As well as joining her owner on underwater visits, Molly has also accompanied Mr Garner on Motorcycle and quad-bike rides.

Launch pad: The vessel can be launched from its custom-built carrier the SP-02 or via a tracked version from the shore

He added: 'We're practically inseparable. No matter what I do, she's there with me and she's a proper adrenaline junkie.'

Mr Garner decided to design his underwater vessel after narrowly avoiding a shark attack while swimming in Portugal 25 years ago.

He added: 'I was around half a mile from shore doing the backstroke when I got the feeling that I wasn’t alone.

'I turned over to see what it was when I was suddenly hit and rolled over twice and I thought "I’m dead".

Safety first: Mr Garner designed the vessel so he could discover the underwater world without being at risk from sharks and other dangers

'Frightened to death I swam as fast as I could for shore before succumbing to cramp.

'That was my motivation for the submarine and I became totally engaged in trying to find a way to see what lay beneath the surface, but in total safety.'

The craft can submerge 4ft below the surface of the water, giving passengers a 360-degree view of life under the sea through the vessel's 40mm thick inverted acrylic hemisphere while remaining perfectly safe. 

Big project: The vessel cost £750,000 and took 35,000 hours to be completed
