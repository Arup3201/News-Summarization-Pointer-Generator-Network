Three girls a day are at risk of having their genitals 'mutilated' in Australia.

Their clitorises are hacked off in unsterilised conditions, condemning them to a life of pain and in many cases infertility and the inability to ever feel sexual pleasure as adults.

Khadija Gbla was nine-years-old when her mother took her into the bush in The Gambia and pinned her down while an old lady cut away at her with a rusty knife.

‘She started hacking away. I remember the pain and trauma of it. The knife was so rusty it felt like it was going on forever,’ Khadija told Daily Mail Australia.

Today the 26-year-old, who lives in Adelaide, still recalls every painful moment of the day she was ‘mutilated’ and the years of mental and physical torture she has endured since.

Khadija Gbla was nine-years-old when her mother took her into the bush in The Gambia to have her circumcised 

‘I was minding my business as a child and then my mother got home and said we were going for a “holiday”…. We got into a car and ended up in the bush in a remote area.

‘An old lady came out and had a chat with my mum. She was very scary looking and had a rusty old looking knife in her hand… my mother took my clothes off and pinned me down on the floor,’ Khadija told Daily Mail Australia.

‘I thought they were going to slaughter me. She lay on my body above what I now know as a clitoris and cut off that piece of flesh.

‘My struggling didn’t help at all. Then she just threw it across the room almost like it was the most disgusting thing she’d seen in her life.

‘I was lying there in shock… It was so confusing and the pain down there was unbearable. Once it was done she put us back in our car took to us to a friend’s house.’

Khadija moved to Australia at the age of 10 after her family was granted refugee status 

Khadija was born in Sierra Leone but when war broke out in 1991 her family moved to The Gambia for safety and then on to Australia when they were granted refugee status in 2001.

As a child Khadija didn’t know what had happened to her or why and for years amnesia state stopped her recalling that terrifying day.

‘You don’t ask question to parents or adults in our culture,’ she explained.

Khadija’s mother ‘circumcised’ her before she came to Australia at the age of 10 because of a lack of education; she thought it was the right thing to do.

Once Khadija came to Australia she was sick ‘all of the time’ with insomnia and depression.

She began volunteering for a charity in South Australia called Women's Health Statewide. She helped educate doctors, police officers and people in the community about Female Genital Mutilation, but all of the while not realising that it was what had happened to her.

This photo was taken of Khadija (centre) shortly after the horrific procedure was carried out and she had arrived in Australia 

It wasn’t until she saw a diagram of the three types of FGM performed on women and children that the memories came flooding back.

She noticed the image of a whole clitoris and labia majora cut off and instantly identified with it.

‘I had amnesia but it all came back to me and from then on I realised I was mutilated in these people’s eyes and that was how the world looks at me.

‘This was what happened to me on that terrible day I realised. It was like I was back at that place.’

From that day on it was something she will never forget.

‘I won’t forget even when I’m 50, I’ll always be able to tell you even when I’m 80… It’s so traumatic, so shocking to the system.

‘Not knowing what was about to happen to me on that day made it worse… there was no pre warning or conversation or knowing what I was getting in to.

The 26-year-old is now an award-winning human right's campaigner who has set up her own charity called NO FGM Australia to help women and girls here

‘That was a shock itself for the body let alone the pain from the cutting and the betrayal from my mother doing it to me even though she thought she was doing it out of love.

A girl is 'at risk' if: 

‘I can’t forget that. Even if I’m asleep and you wake me up. I will always remember,’ Khadija said.

The 26-year-old describes her relationship with her mother as ‘complicated’ and the anger she felt towards her when she found out what she’d done to her is clear in every word Khadija speaks.

‘Once I knew what she took away I was very angry at what she did… as an African Australian I am damaged and I have been abused. There is nothing nice about that,’ Khadija explained.

She confronted her mother and asked why she had circumcised her at the age of nine but her mother ‘saw nothing wrong with what she did’.

‘She thought it was a sign of love, self-control over sexuality and all that nonsense… but really I don’t see how I am empowered by having no clitoris.’

In Africa circumcising girls is seen as the norm in some communities. But Khadija has spent more than half of her life growing up in Australia, she identifies herself as African Australian and she feels very much part of the western country’s ‘clitorial-centric society’.

‘Australia celebrates the clitoris as a symbol of women’s sexuality and it’s an amazing thing,’ she said.

Khadija and her team were finalists at the Human Rights Awards in Sydney on Thursday night

‘I didn’t give her permission to take mine away. No way in hell was it a positive thing. It was so traumatic - even now I am angry.

‘I will be angry for the rest of my life… and her refusal to acknowledge the pain she caused me.

‘She took away something that made me feel powerless and invaded me in the most scared way but she didn’t get it, for her it was OK.’

At school Khadija felt ‘different’ to other children and questioned whether she could still define herself as a woman. She didn’t like her body and she didn’t ‘feel pretty down there’.

‘My private place is a place of trauma. When I take a shower I can feel the scar. I can’t forget it.’

She suffered period pains and such bad stomach cramps that she would crawl on the floor in pain and get strong painkillers from hospital to help her cope. 

She was told she probably wouldn’t be able to have children of her own.

Khadija is now eight months pregnant. Her baby boy is due in February and she just hopes he will be a ‘healthy little boy’.

She calls her pregnancy a ‘miracle’ but even now her FGM is impacting on what should be a happy time.

She continues to fight to stop the violence 'against women and little girls' so that 'another human being doesn't go through this life sentence'

She’s had to deal with health professionals with ‘a lack of knowledge and sensitivity’ and still doesn’t know if she will be able to have a vaginal birth in two months due to her scarring.

‘I’m scared it’s going to be like FGM all over again,’ she said.

Khadija has been working to abolish FGM in Australia, setting up her own charity called NO FGM Australia to provide healthcare and educational support for women and girls.

She also plays a vital role in preventing more children being mutilated in Australia and wants to change the perception that this is about culture.

‘It’s not about culture it’s about violence against women and little girls. They can’t speak up for themselves.

‘In Australia the law say this is illegal and this is child abuse and there is no cultural defence.

'Even back home laws are changing all across Africa… this is a universal concept… it’s wrong and we are being cowards finding any excuse not to take action,’ she said.

Khadija explained for her this is not a political fight, she’s doing it because she has to live with it ‘every single day and there is nobody else that will know what it is.’

‘I wouldn’t wish this on my worst enemy. I know it is a life sentence and it never ends. The consequences never end, from mental health to sexual health.

‘Your vagina becomes a war zone or trauma zone – this is what I fight for, so another human being doesn’t go through this life sentence.’
