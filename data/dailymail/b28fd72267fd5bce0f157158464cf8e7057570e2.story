Inappropriate: The images of women holding phones and peering into the camera suggestively while urging viewers to call them via premium rate telephone numbers has sparked outrage among mothers

Parents have called for broadcasters to stop showing pornography on Freeview channels available in millions of homes.

They are furious that TV companies are allowed to broadcast X-rated material that can easily be seen by children.

Channels such as Dutch-based Babestation and Smile TV show naked women massaging each other and simulating sex to entice viewers to call premium-rate numbers for more hardcore content.

Some 77 per cent of British households have Freeview – leaving most of the nation’s children in danger of accidentally accessing the graphic images.

Although the UK has strict child-protection laws, European legislation stipulates that TV companies are moderated by the regulators from their home country, and not the ones they air in.

This means the channels in question are regulated by the Netherlands’ permissive watchdog, the Commissariaat voor de Media.

As a result, they are free to broadcast graphic, sexually suggestive content on free-to-air digital channels between 10pm and 6am.

Powerless: Ofcom is powerless to ban the channels because they are registered in the Netherlands

Yesterday it emerged that media 
regulator Ofcom has made a formal complaint to its Dutch counterpart, 
following floods of complaints online.

One parent commented on message board Mumsnet: ‘A young child is much 
more likely to scroll down to adult channels than they are to log in to a
computer and type in something related to porn.’

Another added: ‘There are about six or seven channels showing this 
material from 10pm through to 5-6am. I can’t believe they are allowed on
at this time when there are toddlers up and about.’

Although more extreme content is only offered on PIN-protected websites 
or premium rate phone lines, the Freeview channels are relatively easy 
to access through a TV’s electronic programme guide, as they have 
prominent positions below channel 200.

Broadcaster Six TV has complained to MPs and regulators that the porn 
appears before its regional content in the programme list and viewers 
can stumble on them as they scroll through the channels.

It is possible to delete the offending content, but only temporarily. 
Freeview automatically updates its service periodically to scan for new 
channels – a process that also reinstates any that have been blocked.

Last night Caroline Dinenage, Conservative MP for Gosport and a member 
of the parliamentary inquiry into online child protection, said: ‘The 
shocking images we are talking about here are being shown on terrestrial
television and are available free to everyone, including children and 
teenagers.

‘We need to urgently address TV content that could be harming our 
children. It is simply not acceptable to place private profit before the
protection of children.’

A spokesman for Ofcom said: ‘We take the protection of UK viewers, 
especially children, extremely seriously. We are in active discussions 
with the Dutch TV regulator to see if further protections can be put in 
place to protect UK audiences.’

A spokesman for Freeview said plans were under way to move all adult channels to the end of the programme guide.

Freeview, launched in 2002, is run by the BBC, ITV, Channel 4, Sky, and 
transmitter operator Arqiva. It allows homes to access channels such as 
BBC3, BBC4, ITV2 and More 4.
