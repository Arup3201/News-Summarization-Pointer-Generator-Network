An angler hooked two fish for the price of one when he caught a monster pike that had a 4ft long eel in its mouth.

The greedy pike was in the middle of devouring the long slippery eel when he went for Mick Brown's plastic 'lure' fish he was using as bait.

The veteran angler realised something felt very odd about the catch but was shocked when the two fish emerged from the water.

This big: Angler Mick Brown was left stunned when he hooked two fish for the price of one when he caught a monster pike that had a large eel in its mouth

The pike spat out the perfectly intact, but dead eel on the bank and Mr Brown, 66, weighed it at 4lb 8ozs - 1lb heavier than his own personal best for an eel.

He weighed and photographed the 17lb pike before returning it to the water safe and well.

Mr Brown, a professional angler, had been filming a new type of bait when the extraordinary catch occurred at Langtoft Lakes in Cambridgeshire.

Mr Brown, from Market Deeping, Lincolnshire, said: 'I have been fishing for as long as I can remember and this is one of the most amazing things I have ever seen.

'I had just started when I hooked this pike.

'It didn't feel quite right from the start, sort of like I had hooked a plastic bag under the water. I don't think the pike put up much of a fight because it was concentrating on the eel.

'I couldn't believe it when the pike broke the surface and had this eel in its throat. The lure was lodged down inside the pike's jaw and one of the hooks had latched onto the eel.

'Pike eating eels is not unusual but it is very rare indeed to catch one hanging out of its mouth.

'They normally quietly digest them over a number of days so it is very unusual for a pike to take a bait while eating something else.

'It would have been just sitting at the bottom of the lake quietly enjoying its meal when it saw the bait and decided to go for that as well. It must have just been greedy.

'When the temperatures are low like they are at the moment the eels get quite lethargic, so this one wouldn't have put up much of a fight.'

Despite fishing in the same lake for the last 25 years, it is the largest eel Mr Brown has ever caught there by a pound.

Mark Lloyd, chief executive of the Angling Trust, said pikes have massive appetites.and one of the joys of angling is when unexpected things like this happen.

'Pike are known for their appetite and will try and eat all sorts of other fish. I've never seen one eat an eel before but it doesn't surprise me,' he said. 'They'll eat small ducks, mice that fall into the water and frogs as well.

'They are savage predators and it is one of the great attractions of fishing for pike. A small pike eats three times its body weight in two days and they go after anything that moves.'
