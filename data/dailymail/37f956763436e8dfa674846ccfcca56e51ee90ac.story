In the dock: Teacher Stephen Bowers (outside Leeds Crown Court) has been accused of raping a 15-year-old pupil after he discovered she had a crush on him

A teacher allegedly raped a 15-year-old pupil he knew had a crush on him by reading her diary, a court heard yesterday.

Stephen Bowers, 35, started a sexual relationship with the girl, kissing her in the school store cupboard and later taking her virginity at his house, a court was told.

The illicit affair ended abruptly when he allegedly had sex with her against her will, again at his home. The girl claims Bowers forced himself upon her in his bedroom even though she told him she didn’t feel well.

She did not tell the police until eight years later, following a confession to a counsellor.

The sexual relationship began in 2004 when she was a year 9 pupil at the secondary school in West Yorkshire where Bowers taught English. He was popular and regarded as ‘cool’ – singing in a student band and taking pupils to concerts.

Bowers became aware of the girl’s feelings for him when she left her diary in class and he found it.

He went on to a website used by pupils and wrote a poem called ‘Star Girl’ in which he referred to the diary and admitted his feelings for her.

The girl replied by sending him an internet message. He later replied saying he loved her, she claimed.

The alleged store cupboard encounter came in April 2004 – ‘the first time we touched each other’, she said.

On another occasion he is said to have rescued her from town centre bullies and taken her to his parents’ empty house.

She said he took off her bra and they kissed passionately. Although they were disturbed by a relative of Bowers, the girl, who is now in her 20s, said the sex sessions continued at his home in Leeds.

‘I don’t particularly remember being 
pressured into it because I believed I was totally in love with this guy
 and he was amazing,’ she said. ‘He was an English teacher and he kind 
of had a way with words. To me we were in love and it was going to last 
forever.’ Describing their first time together, she said: ‘He had never 
had sex with a virgin before and he told me he was quite excited.

‘It was totally consensual at that point. Even though I knew it was wrong in the eyes of the law I thought the law was wrong.’

The alleged rape happened in autumn 
2004 at Bowers’ house. She said they watched a film and ate a pizza 
before having consensual sex.

Later when Bowers wanted sex again she told him she wasn’t feeling well, she said.

The court heard that Bowers told her: ‘You really don’t want this do you?’

Adrian Strong, for the Crown, said of 
the rape allegation: ‘The prosecution say Stephen Bowers took advantage 
of that vulnerability and forced sex upon her.’

Bowers was arrested in March last year but did not comment in police interview.

Mr Strong said the defendant’s case 
was likely to be that there was no intimate contact with the girl, that 
he was aware of a crush on her part but nothing happened between them.

Bowers, of Ackworth, West Yorkshire, denies rape and three charges of sexual activity with a child.

The trial, at Leeds Crown Court, continues.

Mr Bowers was found not guilty of all charges.  In May 2014, the Disclosure & Barring Service (DBS) decided that it was not appropriate to include Mr Bowers in the Children’s Barred List or the Adults’ Barred List. However, on 19 September 2014 the Secretary of State for Education barred Mr Bowers for life from teaching children after the Professional Conduct Panel of the National College for Teaching found on 17 September on a balance of probabilities that he was guilty of professional misconduct, including having sex with Pupil A “on one or more occasions while she was under the legal consensual age”.
