Danczuk has become well known for her Twitter selfies, which appear to focus on her generous chest

Karen Danczuk, the wife of a Labour MP, has treated her online admirers to one of her raciest selfies yet.

The Labour councillor has tweeted the photograph of herself showing off her ample cleavage in a skimpy top.

Cllr Danczuk, wife of MP Simon Danczuk, is still wet from a dip in the sea in the picture, delighting many of her followers.

The Rochdale politician, 31, has become well known for her Twitter selfies, which appear to focus on her generous chest.

A message she tweeted alongside the picture read: 'How chuffed do I look? I've faced my fear & swam in the sea for the first time in my life! It was fab. I'm made up. KD'.

Fellow Twitter user Alistair Rattenbury, from Lyme Regis, responded: '@KarenDanczuk good buoyancy aids there'.

Another follower, using the handle @LilDegger on the microblogging website, simply asked: 'Breast stroke?'

She has also sparked rumours that she could soon be featuring on the nations television screens, having revealed she has been in talks with Channel 4.

Mrs Danczuk wrote: 'I've got dinner with the big bosses from Channel 4 later. Killer heels or sensible heels?? That is the question!! KD'

She later posted a picture of her in another low curt outfit, adding: 'I'm ready folks! What do you think?? KD'.

Mrs Danczuk has posted more than 50 selfies in recent months and has gained 13,300 followers. 

She has continued to address her critics in recent tweets, which include: 'I agree there are gender equality issues, but to suggest a woman can't embrace her sexuality just in case is madness. Its me & my curves! KD'.

A message she tweeted alongside the picture read: 'How chuffed do I look? I've faced my fear & swam in the sea for the first time in my life! It was fab. I'm made up. KD'.

Mrs Danczuk, who has been urged by friends to run for parliament, added: 'This is the new type of politics. A determined make up wearing female, who takes pride in her appearance! KD #power'.

Earlier this year Mrs Danczuk was embroiled in a furious online Twitter spat with the former Tory MP Louise Mensch over pictures of her cleavage.

The Labour councillor today told her thousands of Twitter followers that she has been sunbathing topless on holiday after Mrs Mensch publicly accused her of demeaning women in politics by posting pictures of her cleavage online.

But Karen, wife of Labour MP Simon Danczuk, hit back - accusing Mrs Mensch of being 'obsessed' with her chest and called on her to stop 'bitching' about other women in politics.

Mrs Danczuk has insisted that her revealing Twitter photos are not meant to be sexy. Right, Simon Danczuk
