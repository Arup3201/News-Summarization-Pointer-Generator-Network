Mitt Romney may be considering another presidential run after all, his wife Ann suggested in an interview that aired Tuesday.

Prodded about her husband's intentions, Ann Romney told Fox News' Neil Cavuto that 'at this point' she and Mitt are 'not making plans' for 2016.

Asked moments later what Mitt would do if a presumed candidate like Jeb Bush, a moderate Republican from Florida, decided not to run, Ann told Cavuto: 'Well, we will see, won't we Neil?'

Mitt, a two-time Republican presidential candidate and former Massachusetts Governor, has sworn up and down that he’s not plotting another presidential campaign, and it would take some serious begging from fellow Republicans to get him into the 2016 race.

The 2012 presidential nominee has adamantly said he’s had his turn and ‘someone else has a better chance’ at winning.

Allies of the Republican power broker say he should stay open minded to the idea of a comeback campaign, however, and insist they’d be right there supporting him if he did choose to run again.

Mitt Romney has said he won't run again unless other qualified candidates sit 2016 out. His presence on the campaign this trail with Republican candidates competing in the midterm elections have stoked speculation that he will.

‘We miss Mitt a lot,’ Women for Romney director Lisa Spies told MailOnline.

‘I can speak for a lot of other staffers when I tell you people would be honored to work for him again. No doubt in my mind. It’s a no brainer,’ she said. ‘We would all die for the opportunity to work for him again.’

Former Romney deputy campaign manager Katie Packer Gage agreed that many of Romney’s former staffers, herself included, who ‘really believe’ in him ‘would love to see him do it because we all think he would have been an outstanding president and still think that he’s the best candidate out there.’

House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan, the 2012 vice presidential nominee who is a potential 2016 presidential candidate himself, said he would also have his former running mate’s back if he saddled up for the rodeo for a third time.

‘I would love to see Mitt run again,’ Ryan told CNBC last month. ‘I hope he does.’

Republicans have a deep bench of presidential candidates to choose from in 2016, with as many as a dozen current and former lawmakers, including Bush, a former governor himself, hinting at plans to form exploratory committees next year, and it would be highly unusual for the party’s most recent presidential nominee to compete for the presidency again. 

Normally when a political party loses a presidential election their nominee becomes an elder statesman.

Sens. John McCain and John Kerry, who were their parties’ respective nominees in 2008 and 2004, went back to lawmaking after their campaigns ended. Former Vice President Al Gore launched an issue advocacy campaign to tackle climate change when he was bested in the 2000 general election by George W. Bush.

But as Romney supporters have pointed out, it took Ronald Reagan three tries at the presidency to get elected, and he is now one of the most beloved former presidents in American history.

Recent polling in early voting states suggests Romney wouldn’t be laughed off the national stage if he decided to follow in Reagan's footsteps and take another shot at the White House in 2016.

A WMUR-TV poll taken in July found that 39 percent of Republicans in New Hampshire would support Romney in the party primary.

In Iowa, Romney would win the support of 35 percent of Republicans in the primary, according to a USA Today/Suffolk University poll conducted in August.

Kevin Madden, a former Romney spokesman who serves as the executive vice president for external affairs at public relations firm JDA Frontline, attributed Romney’s sudden popularity to ‘buyer’s remorse with the current administration.’

‘So many of the points he promoted during the campaign ended up being proven right, whether Ukraine or the economy or Obamacare – you name it,’ he told MailOnline.

Romney said in a 2012 interview with CNN that that Russia was the United States’ biggest ‘geopolitical foe’ after Obama was caught on a hot mic promising then- Russian President, now Russian Prime Minister, Dimitri Medvedev more flexibility after his reelection.

Political analysts mocked Romney at the time for pointing the finger at Russia and claimed that he was out of his depth when it came to national security.

Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has shifted the former presidential candidate’s standing in the foreign policy arena, however, and Romney supporters frequently offer the international debacle as proof that their candidate was right all along.

‘People thought that was crazy, now people are like wait a second, he knows what he’s talking about,’ Spies told Mail Online.

Romney himself has taken Obama to the woodshed over his foreign policy in Russia and other parts of the world in recent television appearances and op-eds.

A flurry of activity in the media and on the campaign trail this summer and has had talking heads and Romney supporters wondering if the former politician really is flirting with another campaign.

‘Every time he comes to a fundraiser most donors will send an email to me saying, “Oh my God, is he running?” ’ Spies said. ‘I think they’re just hopeful.’

Utah Senator Jason Chaffetz says he, for one, thinks Romney may be giving more thought to 2016 than he’s letting on.

‘Right now, I think there are more reasons [for Romney] to do it than not,’ Chaffetz told the Salt Lake Tribune in August. ‘I haven’t yet consulted my Magic 8 Ball, but I bet it would come to the same conclusion.

‘He’s not exactly tucking his hat down low and fading off into the sunset,’ he pointed out. ‘He is still a very visible presence.’

Anthony Scaramucci, the National Finance Co-Chair for Mitt Romney in 2012, told Fox Business earlier this month that Romney could enter the race if an establishment candidate pulled the plug.

'I don’t think he’s 100% made the decision,' Scaramucci said. 'But a couple of factors could happen: If Gov. Jeb Bush drops out or declares that he's not going to run, I think that puts Gov. Romney in...position.

'I think he's going to do it,' Scaramucci concluded. 'I don't think there's any reason for him not to do it. His family is behind him.  

Ann Romney told Cavuto in her interview that while such a scenario is possible - that Bush drops out and husband dives in - it's not likely.

'I think Jeb probably will end up running myself,' she said.

Mrs. Romney indicated that her husband's final decision would hinge on whether former Florida Governor Bush opts to make a political comeback next year.

'I think he would draw on a very similar base that we would draw on,' she said, and 'I'm sure he's considering it very seriously right now.'

Scaramucci, a financier who raised money hand over first for Romney in 2012 from Wall Street, told Fox Business that Romney would still be his guy in 2016.

'I can tell you right now. The governor has a very strong following, including myself. And he'd be my No. 1 draft pick,' he said.

Madden, the former Romney spokesman, told MailOnline he's doubtful that Mitt is positioning himself to do anything other than help out the party, though.

‘What’s happening is he’s going where the need is and he feels he can help,’ Madden said.

‘Say what you want about the Romney 2012 campaign, the one thing it did really well was raise money,’ he said.

‘I think that’s where a lot of the demand comes from for Governor Romney’s appearances on the campaign trail,’ Madden commented. ‘He has a proven ability to attract people and make a case for the raising of resources for candidates.’

Romney has appeared at campaign events this fall for a number of Republican candidates in tight races, including former Massachusetts Sen. Scott Brown, who has relocated to New Hampshire and is now running for the Senate there.

He's also headlined fundraisers for those candidates, helping introduce aspiring lawmakers to the big dollar donors who funded his two presidential campaigns.

Romney's most recent deputy campaign manager, Gage, said she didn’t think Romney would run again, either, and predicted that fevered support for him would die down as other Republicans officially announce their candidacies.

‘Right now,’ she said, ‘there really isn’t really another candidate that’s of the same caliber that people are rallying behind.

‘So of course they’re looking to a candidate that’s so effective and articulated what a lot of people were thinking so well,’ she explained. ‘There’s a little thirst for that leadership.’

Yet the former Romney aide was careful not to count out  another attempt at the presidency for her previous boss, either.

‘Never say never,’ Gage said.
