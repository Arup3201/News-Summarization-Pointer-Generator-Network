Nigel Farage today claimed mass immigration had left parents too uneasy to let their children play in the street - as he appeared shift Ukip policy by backing a cap on numbers.

The Ukip leader used an election campaign launch beneath the White Cliffs of Dover to demand that net migration be cut to 30,000.

It comes less than four weeks after he insisted he would not set 'caps or targets' for controlling Britain's borders.

Ukip claims the current system is 'unsustainable, unethical and unfair' and calls for more high-skilled workers and people from the Commonwealth to be allowed into Britain.

The policy depends on Britain leaving the European Union, with polls showing support for staying in is rising. 

Unveiling a new poster in Kent today, Mr Farage said he wanted immigration reduced to roughly the levels seen between 1950 and 2000.

Mr Farage said: ‘I want to live in a community where our kids play football in the streets of an evening and live in a society that is at ease with itself. And I sense over the last decade or more we are not at ease.’

'If we went to virtually every town up eastern England and spoke to people about how they felt their town or city had changed for the last 10 to 15 years, there is a deep level of discomfort.

'Because if you have immigration at these sort of levels, integration doesn't happen.' 

David Cameron promised to to cut net migration below 100,000, but latest figures show that in the year to September the number reached almost 300,000. 

Speaking in the car park of the Coastguard pub in St Margaret's Bay, near Dover, Mr Farage said: 'When Cameron made that promise he was being wilfully dishonest because he knew the truth and I think now the British public five years on know the truth - that you actually cannot have an immigration policy, you can't set targets of any kind at all, you can't attempt to control who comes into Britain, all the while you're members of European Union.'

Ukip's immigration spokesman Steven Woolfe has repeatedly promised a cap on immigration 

Steven Woolfe, September 26: 'Within the points based system Ukip commits to bringing UK net employment migration down to 50,000 people a year'

Steven Woolfe, October 23: 'I promised to cap migration to 50,000 a year'

Steven Woolfe, February 26: 'We will set a cap on the number of people permitted to work and reside in the UK by introducing a fairer, and more transparent points based system ensuring we get the skilled immigrants we need and in numbers that the economy can manage.'

Nigel Farage, March 4 :'I'm not putting caps or targets ... you need to have more flexibility than that.'

Nigel Farage March 31: 'A return to normality, a return to about a net 30,000 people a year coming into this country.'

Asked what sort of immigration levels he would like to see, Mr Farage said: 'A return to normality, a return to about a net 30,000 people a year coming into this country.

'I'm saying a net level of about 30,000 a year is roughly what we had for 50 years from 1950 almost until the turn of the century. It was a level at which the country was comfortable and that integration was possible and it didn't, crucially, compress the wages, push down the wages of ordinary people.' 

Ukip's immigration spokesman Steven Woolfe had promised a cap, declaring last month: 'We will set a cap on the number of people permitted to work and reside in the UK by introducing a fairer.'

At last year's party conference, he announced: 'Ukip commits to bringing UK net employment migration down to 50,000 people a year.'

But earlier this month Mr Farage ditched the idea, declaring: 'I'm not putting caps or targets ... you need to have more flexibility than that.'

Charlie Elphicke, who is standing for re-election as the Tory MP in Dover, said: 'All we've seen from Ukip on immigration is chaos and confusion: one minute there's a cap, then there's not. Mark Reckless says certain migrants should be repatriated, then Farage says they're welcome to stay.

'The bottom line is that a vote for Ukip puts Ed Miliband one step closer to Downing Street via the back door – and then there will be no action on immigration.'

Setting out the Ukip policy, Mr Farage claimed that Britain was now a country that was not at ease with itself due to the levels of immigration over the last decade.

Mr Farage claimed the figure of 30,000 represented a 'return to normality', when net immigration was somewhere between 15,000 and 50,000.

But the Ukip leader said that if Britain pulled out of the European Union after a referendum, those levels could be achieved within the next five years.

He said: 'We have to have a referendum first.

'If we had a referendum at the end of this year and within two years, all the details (of withdrawing from the EU), I mean it could take a year.

'There is absolutely no reason why midway through this parliament we couldn't return to normality.'

But despite highlighting numbers he would like to see, Mr Farage claimed the immigration debate was 'devalued' by mentioning figures and targets.

'It is by putting out figures that this whole debate was devalued five years ago,' he said. 

He claimed that integration has been made impossible by the numbers coming in as he called for a ban on non-English speakers being allowed into the country.

Asked if all immigrants should be able to speak English, he said: 'Yes, I do.

'There's no doubt, if you talk to Kent Police or Kent hospitals about translation services, it's a cost they could do without.'
