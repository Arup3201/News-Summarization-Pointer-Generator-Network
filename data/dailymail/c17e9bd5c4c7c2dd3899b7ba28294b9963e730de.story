A 'bloody ugly' house in Mona Vale on Sydney's northern beaches has sold for close to $2 million, almost $500,000 over the reserve price on Saturday.

The four bedroom property on Narrabeen Park Parade, was described by the selling co-agent Michael King of Sothesby's as having 'no endearing features whatsoever. It was awful, it just had nothing.'

'Beauty is in the eye of the beholder. But it's bloody ugly,' he told Daily Mail Australia.

One of the selling agents described the property as 'bloody ugly' and having a 'dog smell'

He added that the property even had a bad smell: 'It smelt like a dog had been living there for 20 years.'

The bidding for the house opened at $1.2 million and soon passed the reserve price of $1.45 million, before it eventually sold for $1.91 million, $460,000 above the reserve price.

'It was ultimately about the spot. I put it down to supply and demand. They're generally generational properties. They're tightly held, you seldom see the same one come up again and again,' he said.

The late-60's, brick veneer family home is a short walk from the beach and is in a low-density area, with no apartments around it.

Mr King said the successful buyers were likely going to redevelop the property

'It's all about location': The four-bedroom family home is in the desirable northern beaches suburb of Mona Vale

The property was last up for sale in 1990, when it was purchased for $367,500.

Mr King also added that the northern beaches region has been 'dragging the chain' as property prices have skyrocketed across Sydney and prices in the region are finally catching up to the rest of the city.

'Inner-city markets have been doing well for a while, but the northern beaches have dragged behind it,' he said.

Mr King said the buyers, a couple with adult children, are likely to redevelop the house at some point, although not speculatively.

The property has a direct pathway to the beach nearby
