The plane in which seven Britons died en route to Mount Everest may have crashed because it hit a bird just after take-off, when it was already struggling due to being overloaded, a report into the crash has concluded.

The twin-engine propeller plane crashed shortly after take-off near Nepal's capital, Kathmandu, last September.

Among the seven British victims were Raymond Eagle, 58, from Macclesfield, Timothy Oakes, 57, from Warrington, and brothers Vincent and Darren Kelly, aged 50 and 45, from Lostock, near Bolton.

The plane lost power and slowed down at a crucial point during take-off but investigators were unable to find why this happened.

It meant the plane was not high enough to recover when it went off course.

The report also records that while 
preparing for take-off, the pilot twice noticed a bird and as the plane 
accelerated, he said 'watch out for the bird'.

The first officer reported being clear of it as he accelerated but the crew later reported a bird strike.
However, no evidence of it was found in the engine.

Investigators said: 'It is possible 
that the bird momentarily disturbed the air flow into the engine before 
it was struck by the propeller, causing a surge and the suspected flame 
seen in the CCTV footage, but the engine manufacturer considered this 
unlikely.

'If the flame seen in the CCTV and 
accompanying "bang" heard on the CVR were evidence of an engine surge, 
then another possible cause is a fuel flow problem.'

As the plane turned, it lost power and began to descend, before suddenly hitting the ground just 420 metres from the runway.

The report says one engine failed and the other suffered a power loss.

Destroyed: The fire quickly spread to the rear of the plane, but the tail was still in one piece at the scene near the Manohara River on the south-west edge of Kathmandu

The engine was also operating at low power.

It said: 'There was no evidence to 
suggest that the flight crew recognised that a power loss had occurred 
on the ground, possibly because it occurred gradually and progressively 
rather than instantaneously. This would account for why the takeoff was 
continued.'

They concluded there was no evidence 
of a bird in the engine, both engines were low on power and when speed 
fell, there was no power to accelerate.

It added: 'The investigation was unable to determine the cause of the thrust reduction.'

Five Chinese also died, as well as three passengers and four crew members from Nepal.

The tragedy had been blamed simply on
the plane striking a bird of prey at a height of 
50ft as it took off from Tribhuvan Airport in the Nepalese capital 
heading for Lukla near Everest.

But
experts doubted whether that alone would have prevented 
the pilot from bringing the Sita Air Dornier D-228 back around for an 
emergency landing at the airport.

Indian government aviation minister 
Suresh Acharya said that the combined weight of passengers and luggage 
carried by the plane would play a key part in the inquiry, which British
investigators from the Air Accidents Investigation Branch assisted with.

Mr Acharya 
said: ‘The bird strike may not be the sole reason behind the crash.’

And Kuma Sherchan, an experienced 
pilot with the Nepal  Airlines Corporation said: ‘A bird hitting the 
plane should not be considered in isolation during the investigation.

Traveller: Christopher Davey, 51, from Moulton in Northamptonshire, died in the crash

‘Several factors, such as technical maintenance, load, pressure on airline operators and many more, lead to an air crash.’

All
those on board – including 12 people from Nepal and China – died in the
inferno when the twin-prop aircraft ploughed into a riverbank minutes 
after take off.

The Britons, who were due to begin trekking in the Himalayas, were travelling with Hampshire-based company Explore Worldwide.

They
were named as Raymond Eagle, 58, from Macclesfield, Cheshire; Timothy 
Oakes, 57, from Winwick, near Warrington, and his friend Stephen 
Holding, 60, from Barlaston in Stoke-on-Trent; Vincent Kelly, 50, from 
Lostock, Bolton, and his brother Darren, 45, from Isle of Whithorn, 
Galloway; Christopher Davey,  51, from Moulton in Northamptonshire; and 
lawyer Benjamin Ogden, 27, from London. Former headmaster Mr Oakes and 
retired science teacher Mr Holding had been childhood friends and were 
members of a climbing club.

Mr Holding’s widow, Maggie, said: ‘Steve always loved being in the mountains. He had done a lot of work with Peak Pursuits taking youngsters on Duke of Edinburgh activities.’

Mr Oakes’s wife, Angie Gaunt, 54, said he ‘died doing something he always wanted to do.’

Mr Ogden, an Oxford-educated lawyer, lived with girlfriend Stephanie Illingworth in London and worked at international law firm Allen & Overy.

Miss Illingworth said they had planned to marry and she had lost her ‘soulmate’.

She added: ‘My whole world has been turned upside down.’
