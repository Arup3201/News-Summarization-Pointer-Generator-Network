A disabled grandmother was killed in a freak accident when she got her head trapped in her stair lift an inquest has heard.

Shirley Perkins, 55, toppled backwards down the stairs and got her head wedged between the metal rung of the electric seat and the wall.

Her lifeless body was discovered by her daughter Claire who arrived at the home in Berryhill, Stoke-on-Trent, Staffs., to collect her mother for a shopping trip on June 27.

Freak accident: Shirley Perkins, 55, died after toppling backwards down the stairs and getting her head wedged between her stairlfit and the wall (file picture)

An inquest heard the former pottery worker had a stair lift fitted after she suffered breathing difficulties but occasionally had the strength to walk up them unaided.

On the night of her death the grandmother-of-one, who was said to have a history of alcohol abuse, had got drunk on wine before going to bed.

But as she stumbled up the one flight of stairs she tripped and fell backwards with her head jammed between the wall.

Shirley’s daughter, Claire told North Staffordshire Coroners Court: 'Her health was neither good nor bad, but she was well enough to look after my son.

'She had fallen down the stairs about five years ago and we still don’t know how that happened, but she was in a coma for four months.

'After the fall, she wasn’t very good. It was more her breathing than anything else but she could still do her shopping.

North Staffordshire Coroners Court heard how the 55-year-old grandmother had got drunk on the night of her death although her daughter denied she was an alcoholic

'She used to tell me if she used her stair lift she would lose the use of her legs, so she didn’t go on it very often.

'Mum wasn’t an alcoholic but she did have three or four bottles of wine a week.

'I would go round in the day and thought she had had a drink, but when I asked her she said she hadn’t.

'With her falling down the stairs, I assumed she had been drinking, but there was not a lot of drink in the house at the time when she died.'

A post-mortem found Shirley’s blood-alcohol content was 360ml per decilitre - four-and-a-half times the drink drive limit.

PC Alan Rossi, of Staffordshire Police, was the first officer to attend the scene after he daughter dialled 999.

He told the hearing: 'There was a stair lift and the lady was positioned between the back of it and the wall, with her neck resting on the seat.

'She was wedged in and I think anyone would struggle to get out of that position.

'There was nothing on the stairs and there was nothing out of place, it just seemed as if she had fallen.

'There was an unopened bottle of wine in the living room but there were no glasses.'

North Staffordshire Coroner Ian Smith confirmed that Shirley died from asphyxia as a result of the fall and acute alcohol intoxication.

Recording a verdict of accidental death, Mr Smith told the hearing on Monday: 'The deceased had a history of alcohol abuse and was last seen alive around 6.30pm on June 26.

'It is very difficult to say when she died but I think everyone excepts it was a fall.

'She would have been very intoxicated and my verdict is one of accidental death.

'It was an accident in terms of a fall or a trip but I have no doubt alcohol has played some part in what happened to her.'
