Ed Balls sparked disbelief yesterday by claiming he had no idea Damian McBride was briefing against Labour colleagues

Ed Balls sparked disbelief yesterday by claiming he had no idea Damian McBride was briefing against Labour colleagues.

The Shadow Chancellor insisted the former spin doctor was a ‘law unto himself’, saying he was horrified to learn what he was up to.

Mr Balls worked side by side for years with Mr McBride helping plot Gordon Brown’s eventual path to Downing Street and his takeover from Tony Blair in 2007.

In his book, Power Trip, the former spin doctor describes regular evenings out with Mr Balls and Mr Miliband.

He, the Shadow Chancellor and Mr Brown shared a deep love of football and late night brainstorming sessions over pizza.

Mr McBride even gives one whole chapter of his book to Mr Balls.

BBC political editor Nick Robinson said a ‘collective eyebrow’ had been raised across Westminster when Mr Balls professed no knowledge of Mr McBride’s tactics.

Even some of Mr Balls’s Shadow Cabinet colleagues were surprised at the vehemence of his denials.

And Labour leader Ed Miliband has said he complained about Mr McBride’s behaviour to Mr Brown.

But Mr Balls said: ‘Nobody ever came to me and complained about Damian McBride.

I didn’t pass on those complaints to Gordon Brown. I didn’t complain about Damian McBride, because I don’t think until we saw the revelations in this book, we didn’t know what was going on.

‘I didn’t know that Damian McBride was doing personal briefings against ministers.’ 

Mr Balls said the first time he found out was when a ‘hideous’ email written by Mr McBride proposing to disseminate unfounded smears about the private lives of senior Conservatives was leaked in 2009.

‘I said to Damian “What have you done? How could it come to this?” I think it’s no way to do politics. I think Ed Miliband and I have moved politics and the Labour party a long way from those bad, bad times,’ he said.

‘It’s in the past. It’s irrelevant. It’s depressing. I’m happy to say that what I’ve seen in this book is shocking and despicable. It’s no way to do politics.’

Mr Balls later denied taking part in any negative briefing against colleagues.

‘That’s not something I’ve ever done,’ he said.

‘Damian McBride has come out and said he did some of those things. It was despicable. It was the wrong thing to do. Politics is tough.

There have been times in the past where I’ve had strong arguments with Tony Blair on the euro, with Gordon Brown on different issues. But I’ve always done that in public and in an open way.

‘This kind of negative, nasty briefing is wrong, but also it’s a thing of the past.

The Blair-Brown era is gone. There’s been none of it for the last three or four years. We’re in a better place now.’

When former No 10 spin doctor Alastair Campbell was asked by Channel 4 News if he shared the scepticism about the denial by Mr Balls, he replied: ‘You might say that, I couldn’t possibly comment.’

Mr Balls yesterday visited a children’s centre in Brighton on the second day of Labour’s conference in the town.

I was watching the German election last evening listening to the polititians.It struck me how grown up they are when you listen to our lot.It puts you in mind of a play school.It would be funny if it were not so serious for how far this once great country has fallen.Yes all countries have their problems but it is so dis-spiriting to see and hear people like Balls prattling on.In his defence he is not alone our whole polititical system is geared for doing this country and its people.More harm than good.

...........every so often, a story breaks in the news that involves the government of the day or its affiliates & some will make comments, that then get ridiculed as nothing more than conspiracy theory by tin-foil hat wearing loons......and then we read how our government officials & politicians really behave. 
The simple truth is that most of 'em have no honour nor moral compass, they lie, fabricate obfuscate,contrive manipulate and smear....and that is just how they behave toward each other.

Lets be fair to Mr Balls, he has never "lied" about anything and he certainly never fiddled his expenses or flipped his house for financial benefit!
