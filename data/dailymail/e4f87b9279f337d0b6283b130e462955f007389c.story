Four firefighters were injured after helping a college marching band perform an ALS ice bucket challenge on Thursday.

Firefighters Tony Grider, 41, and Alex Quinn, 22, remain hospitalized after the incident, which happened Thursday morning at the Campbellsville University campus in Kentucky.

The two firefighters were in the bucket of their truck's ladder when a surge of electricity jumped over from nearby power lines and shocked them and two other firefighters.

Captain Grider and Quinn were taken to the University of Louisville hospital where Grider, an 11-year veteran, was last reported in critical condition. This afternoon, Quinn's condition was upgraded from serious to fair.

The incident happened this morning as the Campbellsville firefighters were helping the local university's marching band perform an ALS ice bucket challenge.

The ice bucket challenge has been sweeping social media, with those taking part pouring a bucket of ice-cold water over their heads to raise awareness for amypthropic lateral sclerosis, also known as Lou Gehrig's disease.

The Campbellsville University marching band decided to take the challenge in a unique way, by having the local fire department soak them from above with their fire hose.

Pictures of the marching band being sprayed by Grider and Quinn have already been posted on Twitter.

It was only after the challenge, while Grider and Quinn were packing up the ladder, that a surge of energy struck the ladder.

Dangerous: Police Chief Tim Hazlette said at a Thursday afternoon press conference that it appears the ladder never even touched live power lines, but that the electricity 'arched over' 

At an afternoon press conference on Thursday, authorities said the power lines may have never even touched the ladder.

'It appears energy arched over and the ladder didn't actually hit the lines. If you get within a certain radius that can happen,' Police Chief Tim Hazlette said.

The shock electrocuted Quinn and Grider as well as fellow firefighters Steve Marrs, 37, and Alex Johnson, 28.

Marrs, an 11-year veteran of the force, and Johnson were taken to Taylor Regional Hospital where they were treated and released.

The incident caused power to go down in the community for several hours, but it has since been restored.

No students were injured.

'A number of our students, of course, the entire marching band, witnessed the event and so we're concerned about them and the tragedy of this accident,' Campbellsville University President Dr Michael Carter said.

Tonight, a prayer vigil was scheduled for 7pm on the Campbellsville campus.

The university has also released a statement expressing their condolences to the injured firefighters.

'Campbellsville University is asking for prayers for two Campbellsville/Taylor County Fire Department firefighters who have been seriously injured on the campus of Campbellsville University.

'We express heartfelt sympathy and prayers for the families of the two firefighters injured.
