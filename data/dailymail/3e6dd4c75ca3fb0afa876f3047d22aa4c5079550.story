Hunched down on skis as he is pulled behind a horse, a skijoring competitor races towards the finish line in St Moritz yesterday.

Trailing his horse Bergonzi, Fadri Casty ended up crossing the line in second place at the skijoring - or ski driving - event at the Swiss resort.

The annual White Turf tournament, which runs for three days, features a series of races involving horses on St Moritz's frozen lake.

Annual event: The White Turf tournament, which runs for three days, features a series of horse races

Tradition: The White Turf horse races at St Moritz date back to 1906, while skijoring debuted there in 1928

These include the more traditional sight of mounted jockeys competing for supremacy in a blizzard of kicked-up snow and trotting

The White Turf horse races at St Moritz date back to 1906, while skijoring debuted there in 1928.

Skijoring originated in Scandinavia 700 years ago as a means of transport during the winter months.

Now it is a specialised sport where competitors on skis are pulled by a horse, dog or motor vehicle.

Off the frozen lake, meanwhile, 
jet-setters in the exclusive Alpine resort are upset at a two-ton bronze
sculpture on the slopes giving them the finger.

Artist Nikolai Winter placed the 
artwork on Berg Muottas Muragl, which attracts wealthy people from 
around Europe each year for skiing holidays.

The anthracite-coloured sculpture, which is nearly 8ft high, was flown in by helicopter.

On his website, Mr Winter states: 
'Hands especially fascinate me. They can be shown in various postures 
and sometimes even have a symbolic character.

'Therefore I use their communicative impact to give my sculptures aura and expression.'

In this case, the nail-polished hand leaves little doubt to what it 'symbolises'.

Everyone who passes it gets a glimpse of the universal symbol for telling people they are not wanted.

Mr Winter added: 'In a sexy, 
provocative but elegant way that sort of embodies the jet-set a 
stink-finger now sits perched above the uber-chic resort of St Moritz.'

But the rich and famous have complained to town authorities that they are being made 'fun of' by the Basel-based sculptor.

One industrialist has said to have 
cancelled his holiday, storming: 'If I want rude gestures I can ask my 
wife any time - she always obliges.Â  But not when I am spending thousands
a day.'
