Extremist: New BNP leader Adam Walker, who received a suspended sentence and a driving ban last year after chasing down three boys aged between ten and twelve in his car, before slashing their bike tyres with a knife

Nick Griffin has been ousted as leader of the British National Party after 15 years and replaced by a disgraced former teacher.

Griffin – who received a  suspended sentence for distributing material likely to incite racial hatred in 1998 – was a Euro-MP but lost his seat in May and recently declared himself bankrupt.

He was forced out at a meeting of his party’s national executive. As well as losing his Euro seat, the BNP have lost all but two of their local councillors this year.

The far-right party have replaced him with former teacher Adam Walker, who received a suspended sentence and a driving ban last year after chasing three boys aged between ten and 12 in his car, before slashing their bike tyres with a knife in 2011.

Walker, from Spennymoor, County Durham, claimed they had provoked him.

He was later banned from teaching for life by former education secretary Michael Gove. Last year, as a BNP organiser, he described Britain as a ‘multicultural s***hole’.

He claimed that British people were being ‘ethnically cleansed’ by excessive immigration and claimed that Lee Rigby-style executions would ‘become  the norm’.

A party spokesman said yesterday: ‘Recently appointed deputy chairman, Adam Walker, has accepted the role of acting chairman of the British National Party after Nick Griffin stepped aside at a meeting of the BNP national executive held on 19th July, 2014. Nick Griffin has taken up the position of president.’

The party’s support has plummeted in recent years. It won more than 6 per cent of the national vote in the 2009 European election, but just 1 per cent in May this year.

The BNP blamed its poor performance in the polls on the rise of Ukip, which it said had become the party of choice for protest votes about Europe and immigration.

Mr Griffin ¿ who received a suspended sentence for distributing material likely to incite racial hatred in 1998 ¿ was an MEP but lost his seat in May and recently declared himself bankrupt

Griffin 
went to Cambridge University in 1977, where he studied history and law 
at Downing  College. While there, he founded the Young National Front 
Students and gained a boxing blue.

He joined the BNP in 1995 and ousted John Tyndall as leader four years later.

In 1998, 
he was convicted of inciting racial hatred after he was found 
distributing material saying the massacre of six million Jews in the 
Holocaust was a hoax. He received a suspended prison sentence.
The party went on to win council seats in Oldham, Burnley  and Bradford.

The BNP 
won more than 500,000 votes at the 2010 general election, up from 
192,000 in 2005. Griffin, 55, was elected an MEP in 2009 for the North 
West of England and lost his seat in May this year.

At their 
height in 2006, the BNP capitalised on tensions over immigration in 
Barking and Dagenham in east London to pick up 11 council seats, giving 
the party a total of 46 councillors nationwide in 18 authorities. Now 
they have just two.
