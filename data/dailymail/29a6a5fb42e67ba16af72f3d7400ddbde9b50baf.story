A deaf and mute woman who was trafficked from Pakistan when she was nine could win £200,000 in compensation from a couple who kept her locked in a cellar as a sex slave for a decade.

The orphan had been brought into the UK in June 2000, when she was aged just nine or ten, by Ilyas Ashar, 84 who beat her and forced her to sleep in the basement of his home in Eccles, Salford.

Ashar and his wife Tallat Ashar, 68, were both jailed last year for their treatment of the victim, but were today at the centre of a landmark court case seeking to win compensation for the girl.

Greater Manchester Police and crown lawyers will start the action today under the Proceeds of Crime Act, hoping to win £200,000 in loss of earnings for the victim's paid domestic servitude.

Ashar was jailed for 13 years after he was found guilty of trafficking and repeatedly raping the girl, while his wife received a five year sentence for trafficking.

This year Solicitor General Oliver Heald referred the cases to the Court of Appeal as ‘possibly unduly lenient’, meaning the couple’s sentences could be increased.

As a result Ilyas’ sentence was increased to 15 years and his wife’s to six years.

The couple were also convicted of benefit fraud relating to the girl, who never went to school in Pakistan or Britain, but was taught by the Ashars to sign her name to claim benefits.

The civil hearing at Manchester’s Minshull Street Crown Court, will also be seeking to recover a further £40,000 from the couple in relation to the benefit fraud.

A judge said the girl, who can not be named because she is a victim of sexual offences, had been treated as a ‘sub human’ following the conclusion of their trial in October last year.

June 2000 The girl, then aged nine or ten, is brought to the UK from Pakistan by Ilyas Ashar. For the next decade she is used as a sex slave, and forced to sleep and work in the cellar of his home in Eccles, Salford. 

July 2005 The girl is given leave to remain in the UK indefinitely, and within two weeks the Ashars began claiming housing, council tax and income support for her. 

June 2009 Police and trading standards officers raided the Ashar family home on a separate matter and were 'shocked' to discover the girl asleep in the cold and dark cellar.

October 2013 Ashar and his wife are convicted over the trafficking of the girl. Ashar is also found guilty of rape. Ashar was jailed for 13 years after he was found guilty of trafficking and repeatedly raping the girl, while his wife received a five year sentence for trafficking.

Passing sentence Judge Peter Lakin says: 'You Ilyas Ashar and you Tallat Ashar did not treat this girl as a human being.

'To you she was merely an object to be used, abused and cast aside at will. You took full advantage of her extreme vulnerability.' 

February 2014 Ashar has his sentence extended from 13 years to 15 years by the Court of Appeal. His wife has her sentence increased from five years to six years.

October 2014 Proceeds of crime hearing in which £200,000 is being sought for the victim in loss of earnings. Police and prosecutors are also seeking to recover a further £40,000 from the couple in relation to benefit fraud

Ashar beat the victim, who is profoundly deaf and cannot speak, used her to satisfy his sexual desires and forced her to sleep and work in the cellar of his five bedroom family home in Eccles, Salford. 

She was also used to steal more than £30,000 in benefits,and had to cook, clean, sew and wash cars for the family and their friends.

The girl wanted to return to her family in Pakistan almost from the moment she arrived in the UK on a passport claiming she was 19 - but the Ashars would not allow it. 

After coming to the UK, despite her apparent young age, as a domestic servant she was allowed to remain on an annual basis on condition that she did not make a claim on public funds.

But by July 2005 she was given leave to remain indefinitely - and within two weeks the Ashars began claiming housing, council tax and income support for the girl.

She was never paid for the work she did for the Ashar family but also never received a penny of the £36,045 in benefits they claimed for her.

For nearly 10 years she had to work for the Ashars who are understood to have a number of business interests and rental properties.

The exact age of the victim is not known, but Minshull Street Crown Court heard how she was sexually abused by Ilyas Ashar from pre-puberty.

He would routinely rape the girl in the cellar and other houses the family owned - though she would try to fight him off. 

When police and local trading standards raided the Ashar family home on the morning of June 8, 2009 on a separate matter, officers were 'shocked' to discover the girl asleep in the cold and dark cellar.

They noted something was 'amiss' when she got up, went upstairs and, instead of sitting on a chair in the kitchen, sat on a plastic stool.

One officer likened her behaviour to that of an 'animal' - not allowed to sit on the furniture - and an indication of her status in the house.

She was taken from the house and is now doing well with the help of social services, the sentencing court heard. 

She was only able to detail the extent of her abuse to police after she was taught basic sign language by experts.

The girl was brought by the couple from a rural Pakistani village near Lahore in 2000 aged around nine or 10, although her exact birthdate is unknown.

The couple denied the charges they faced but were found guilty after a re-trial.

The victim gave evidence to the jury using sign language she had been taught after her release from servitude.
