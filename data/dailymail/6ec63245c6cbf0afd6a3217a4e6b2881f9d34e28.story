When Tim Sherwood met Tottenham chairman Daniel Levy last week, he gave him three specific transfer targets.

West Ham defender Winston Reid, Manchester City midfielder Gareth Barry and Chelsea striker Romelu Lukaku were the men he wanted at White Hart Lane next season.

Sherwood’s recommendations had been taken so seriously during a transfer meeting the previous month that director of football Franco Baldini went to watch Fulham play Everton on March 30, instead of travelling to Anfield to watch Tottenham.

Given the 4-0 scoreline at Liverpool, it was a wise decision.

All over bar the shouting: Tim Sherwood will be replaced as Tottenham manager in the summer

Character: Sherwood has been outspoken as Spurs boss and at times it might have been too much

This break from the norm for Baldini, who usually sits close to Levy in the directors' box at Tottenham matches, was significant.

Lukaku and Barry both played the full 90 minutes for Everton in their 3-1 victory and they were wanted men. Sherwood was desperate to get them to Spurs.

At the time he was in with a chance of keeping the job, despite the interest from Louis van Gaal, Frank de Boer, Carlo Ancelotti and Mauricio Pochettino.

Of the names under consideration at White Hart Lane, former Tottenham striker Jurgen Klinsmann is the only candidate who has not been agitating for the job behind the scenes. Big tick there from the boardroom. More on them in a moment.

Sherwood knows he has made mistakes since he replaced Andre Villas-Boas as Tottenham’s manager and it probably wasn’t a good idea to ask for the ear of the chairman after another leathering, this time at Anfield.

Goodness knows Levy has had a gutful of that this season and anybody who knows him will tell you that no-one gets away with humiliating Tottenham’s chairman in public.

This season alone he has been on the end of some hidings: 6-0 and 5-1 against Manchester City, 5-0 and and 4-0 against Liverpool, 4-0 at Chelsea, 3-0 at home to West Ham and three defeats against Arsenal.

In Levy’s world, someone will always pay the price for that.

Sherwood has certainly provided some entertainment in his 23 games in charge of Spurs, but Levy believes he lacks maturity and stature for such a prestigious position.

It probably wasn’t wise, even in jest, for Sherwood to say that he would be returning to the technical area for the Sunderland game and ‘might knock a few people out’. He knows that.

He is highly-emotional, passionate about his work and his team. There is something to be said for that, even if it is a bit much at times.

Sherwood spoke of the ‘shackles coming off’ after the team ran out 5-1 winners against Sunderland on Monday, shining a torch on his pre-match team talk with Tottenham’s players.

They have been made aware that their manager is leaving at the end of the season and will be replaced someone with vast experience in the game.

Not the answer: Southampton boss Mauricio Pochettino isn't ready to manage Tottenham

That is Levy’s wish, something he has already articulated to his board as he begins to plan for next season.

Presumably this means Southampton manager Pochettino, who has lost twice against Tottenham in the league this season, is not ready for the 14th biggest job in European football, according to the 2014 Deloitte Money League.

At 42, a man who refuses to speak English despite a near perfect command of the language, is not the answer for Tottenham at this moment in time.

Klinsmann, who is preparing for the World Cup with the USA, had been offered the position until the end of the season when Villas-Boas was fired.

Levy had tried to tempt him with the bait that he could keep a closer eye on the Americans playing in Europe if he could help Spurs out in the short term. Klinsmann said no.

Rebuilding job: Daniel Levy (front) will have to appoint yet another manager

After Real Madrid’s stunning 4-3 defeat at home by Barcelona on March 23, Ancelotti was under so much pressure at the Bernabeu he believed he could be fired at the end of the season.

His team are now third in La Liga, three points off Atletico, although they are in Friday’s draw for the Champions League semi-final after beating Borussia Dortmund.

Ancelotti has not been ruled out. The Italian remains an option if he is fired.

Then there is Van Gaal, the man who has kept Tottenham waiting after hanging out for the possibility that Manchester United could replace David Moyes.

The relative upturn in recent results, with the exception of the 3-0 defeat at home by Manchester City, has closed the door on Van Gaal’s hopes of heading to Old Trafford. Moyes is staying for the time being.

Sherwood will not remain and he will walk away from Spurs after their final game of the season at home to Aston Villa on May 11.

Beyond that, Levy will have to start rebuilding this club. Again.
