Nick Clegg was yesterday dealt a humiliating blow after his party refused to fully endorse the Government’s controversial NHS reforms.

Delegates at the Liberal Democrat conference sent a clear message they wanted the Bill to be blocked in the House of Lords.

Activists voted by 314 to 270 against calling on Lib Dem peers to support the Bill at third reading.

Divided: During his keynote conference speech the Deputy Prime Minister conceded that the shake-up was 'controversial' and 'difficult' but had 'proven the value of coalition'

Blocked: Dame Shirley Williams and Nick Clegg were pictured deep in conversation. Activists blocked a bid to make 'killing the Bill' party policy yesterday, instead opting to debate today the pro-reform 'Shirley Williams motion'

The result threw the party into fresh turmoil and leaves Mr Clegg with a political headache. The vote means Labour can now claim that even the Conservatives’ Coalition partners do not support the controversial Bill.

Although the vote is unlikely to affect how Lib Dem peers vote in the Lords, it will increase pressure on them to delay the vote until the NHS risk register is published.

The vote came just a day after Mr Clegg faced down a more substantial potential rebellion which could have seen the party oppose the Bill in full.

Deputy leader Simon Hughes told Sky News: ‘I think the conference reflected the mood of the party and the country.

‘It is not the Bill we would have produced if we had been in government on our own. The party is saying: we are reserving our judgment on the Bill as a whole until we see the final shape of it.’

Tough times: Ed Davey MP, & Chris Huhne MP looked sombre as they listened to Nick Clegg's speech

During a bad-tempered debate, supporters of the Bill were heckled by opponents. In his keynote speech the Deputy Prime Minister conceded the shake-up was ‘controversial’ but had ‘proven the value of coalition’.

‘The Bill was stopped in its tracks and rewritten because this is a coalition government,’ he said. ‘Competition will be the servant of health care, not the master because this is a coalition government.

'This is a Bill for patients not profits.

'It is not a Liberal Democrat health Bill but it is a better Bill because of the Liberal Democrats.'

But Rachel Coleman Finch, a party member from Cambridge, told the conference the politics of the Bill were ‘poisonous’, adding: ‘We need to get away from a macho fear of U-turns.’

Testing times: Nick Clegg looked jubilant as he raised his arms in front of his party but during his keynote conference speech the Deputy Prime Minister conceded that the shake-up was controversial'

Changes: Chief Secretary to the Treasury Danny Alexander (centre) indicated there could be further amendments to the Bill in the Lords

Chief Secretary to the Treasury Danny Alexander indicated there could be further amendments to the Bill in the Lords.

He
said that while there was 'strong recognition' within the party the Lib
Dems had changed the Bill, he admitted there was still a 'small 
majority' of members who wanted to see further amendments.

Mr
Clegg attempted to rally party members by using his conference speech 
to call for higher levies on the rich to fund tax cuts for 'ordinary' 
households.

He also 
vowed to 'call time' on wealthy people who aggressively avoid paying 
levies by employing lawyers and accountants to find loopholes.

Mr Clegg took a pot-shot at his former Treasury spokesman, Lord Oakeshott, who has spoken out against the tycoon tax plans

Mr
Clegg took a pot-shot at his former Treasury spokesman, Lord Oakeshott,
who has spoken out against plans floated this weekend to impose a 
so-called tycoon tax which would set a minimum level of levies paid 
based on overall income.

In
the Sunday Telegraph, the peer, who enjoyed a successful career in the 
City, called Mr Clegg's plan a 'superficially attractive measure that 
falls apart under scrutiny' which would 'do nothing to deal with 
super-rich non-doms and non residents'.

Mr Clegg said: 'The only person against the tycoon tax is one of our very own tycoons.'

Gay marriage will be introduced before 2015, Mr Clegg insisted as church leaders today ramped up rhetoric against the plans.

He
told activists: 'We are bringing forward proposals for gay marriage, 
already provoking debate. Let me just say, if you are a young gay 
person, your freedom to love who you choose is a fundamental right in a 
liberal society - and you will always have our support.'

The first elections to the House of Lords will also take place before 2015, he added.

Mr Clegg insisted the achievements secured by Lib Dems in government had proved the 'luddites' wrong about coalition politics.

And he declared the next election is simply a 'staging post' for the party.

'I
want our ambitions for education to be at the very heart of our 
manifesto in 2015. Education that delivers on the liberal promise: that 
every child can go as far as their talent will take them. That is what 
we Liberal Democrats will fight for.

'So
2015 is not the destination. 2015 is a staging post. This country will 
be a more liberal nation but we will just be beginning to tackle the 
deep problems that cramp the lives of our citizens and hobble our 
economy.'
