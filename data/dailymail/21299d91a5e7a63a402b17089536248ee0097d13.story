The father of a toddler police believe was murdered has called for 'justice for his 'little buddy''.

The boy is one of four children from the same family at the centre of a 'mindboggling' police investigation, in which two of the children are believed to have been murdered and two others were almost killed in a deliberately lit house fire.

The man's three-year-old son, who cannot be named for legal reasons, was found dead at a Moryafield home, on the Sunshine Coast on July 27 2013. His seven-month-old half-brother was found dead at the same address on September 27 2014.

Father and son: The father of a three-year-old boy police believe was murdered in a crime linked to his grandmother wants justice for the dead toddler. 

The father of a toddler police believe was murdered on July 27 last year at the birth of his son.

No one in the 'mindboggling' series of alleged crimes committed at Morayfield, north of Brisbane, can be identifed. This picture shows the father of a toddler who died in July last year. 

On February 27 2014, two other children living at the address - a nine-year-old and an 11-year-old - suffered burns and smoke inhalation when part of the house was set ablaze as they slept.

Each alleged crime occurred on the 27th of the month, prompting police to investigate the 'coincidence'.  

Police investigating the two deaths and the fire are treating a grandmother as a person of interest in what they describe as a 'mindboggling' series of crimes at Morayfield, north of Brisbane.

Until Friday, the father of the three-year-old believed his son had died of complications from a virus. Today, he was calling for justice for his boy, as well his son's half-brother and the two other boys.

'I just want to know what happened to my son,' he said. 'He was my little buddy.'

On Saturday, the man changed his Facebook profile to feature a picture of his son below the words: 'Justice for (the boy's name)'. He had also written the message: 'Justice for all 4. 3 other boys went though hell to so please dont forget about them'.

A relative of the man had posted: 'RIP my little pumpernickel I knew it would all come out in the end. Luvs ya and miss ya heaps (boy's name) xxxxx I'm so sorry I wasn't there to protect you.'

Another user posted: 'How could someone be so evil? Such a innocent little boy'

The father of the three-year-old, who had separated from the boy's mother and was not living with his son when he died, has pleaded for anyone with information to come forward and help police.

'(My son) was a really healthy little boy,' he said. 'When I got the call that night he was at the hospital, something didn’t add up - he was a healthy three-year-old boy. ‘How did my little buddy die?’

Detectives have described a grandmother as being a person of interest in the investigation into the deaths of the two boys and the alleged attempted killing of the other two children as they slept in their beds.

The alleged crimes all occurred at the same home in Morayfield and the grandmother was present during each incident. No one has been charged.

The deaths of the three-year-old and the seven-month old were initially treated as SIDS (Sudden Infant Death Syndrome) cases, police said.

On February 27 this year two boys aged nine and 11 were asleep in their beds in the same home when the house was set ablaze.

The children survived but based on a forensic recreation of the arson attack, detectives believe someone had deliberately blocked their escape pathway from the bedroom.  

Detective Acting Superintendent Damien Hansen said the crimes were horrific. 'To have it happen to defenceless children is just mindboggling,' he told reporters on Friday evening.

Supt Hansen would not identify any family members. Both children and other occupants of the burning house were treated for smoke inhalation. 

'The children were inside the room and could not exit the room,' he said. One child suffered burns to his lower limbs and was treated at Caboolture Hospital.

Police are investigating whether there is a reason why the crimes all occurred on the 27th of the month, Supt Hansen said. 

'It's a matter being investigated,' he said, although he ruled out any religious or cult links to the crimes.

The detective would not rule out the involvement of other people but said police have 'strong leads'.

'We are very confident we have the right line of enquiry with this investigation and will have a conclusion in the near future,' he said.  

The surviving children are now in state care.

Police are calling for anyone with information that could help the investigation or witnessed the house fire on February 27 and the early hours of February 28 to contact CrimeStoppers on 1800 333 000.
