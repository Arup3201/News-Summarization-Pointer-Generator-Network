Off-colour Kevin Pietersen was bowled for a golden duck in Melbourne Stars' three-wicket win at home to Perth Scorchers in the Big Bash.

Pietersen has been in prolific form for much of the competition, hitting three half-centuries, and has continued to make it clear he still harbours ambitions of an England return.

Those hopes are not shared by his former employers, however, and the South Africa-born batsman - controversially sacked by the England and Wales Cricket Board 11 months ago - missed his latest chance to demonstrate his renewed form before the World Cup.

The global tournament will begin on February 14, when England face Australia in Melbourne, and Eoin Morgan's squad are already Down Under for the tri-series against the World Cup co-hosts and India.

Pietersen took his place in the Stars side for their last match before the Big Bash knockout stages, despite a heavy cold, only to aim a big hit and miss his first ball from Yasir Arafat (four for 27) to put the Pakistani seamer on a hat-trick as the Scorchers tried to defend a total of 179 for two.

It therefore fell to others - chiefly Peter Handscomb (103 not out) with a brilliant 64-ball century, and some late hitting too from John Hastings - to complete the run-chase with three balls to spare.

The Stars' reward for their victory is a home semi-final.
