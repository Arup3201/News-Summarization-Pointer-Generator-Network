Sky News yesterday admitted hacking into the email account of back-from-the-dead canoeist John Darwin.

The news channel said it authorised one of its reporters to intercept messages before Darwin was jailed in 2008 for faking his death in an elaborate plot to secure £500,000 in pension and life insurance payouts.

The broadcaster said yesterday that it stood by its actions and insisted that its North of England reporter, Gerard Tubb, was acting in the public interest.

Revelation: Sky News has admitted that it twice authorised journalists to hack phones while they were researching stories they believed to be in the public interest

Sky News is part of BSkyB, which is 
39 per cent owned by Rupert Murdoch’s News Corporation.

Mr Murdoch’s 
media empire has been in the spotlight over claims of phone hacking by 
journalists at some of his British newspapers.

Mr Tubb was authorised by a senior 
executive at Sky News to access Darwin’s Yahoo! email account before his
wife, Anne, went on trial for her part in the scam.

Darwin, of Seaton 
Carew, near Hartlepool, had already pleaded guilty to deception before 
her trial.

The information Mr Tubb gathered was 
handed to Cleveland Police and used in the successful prosecution of Mrs
Darwin in July 2008.

The emails cast doubt on her defence that she had 
been forced to go along with the plot by her ‘domineering’ husband.

Mr 
Tubb had accessed Darwin’s email account in the name John Jones after 
discovering that Darwin had used a false identity after faking his 
death.

Intercepting emails is a prima facie 
breach of the Computer Misuse Act, to which there is no public interest 
defence written in law.

Headache for Murdoch: The tycoon's Sky News channel has admitted authorising reporters to hack emails

But any prosecution would be at the discretion 
of the police and the Crown Prosecution Service.

John Ryley, head of Sky News, said: 
‘We stand by these actions as editorially justified and in the public 
interest.’

He added: ‘The police made clear after the trial that this 
information was pivotal to the case.’

Cleveland Police, which led the 
investigation into the Darwins, said inquiries were ongoing into how Sky
News obtained the emails.

In a separate case, Mr Tubb was authorised to access the emails of a suspected paedophile and his wife.

Both instances of hacking were 
approved by Simon Cole, Sky News’s managing editor.

Yesterday Sky News 
said he was retiring after 17 years and that his retirement was entirely
unrelated to the revelations.

Mr Cole wrote on Twitter: ‘I’ve been 
planning for some time to retire from Sky News. This is unrelated to the
Darwin story. There is no linkage. Fact.’

Mrs Darwin, now 60, was sentenced to six and half years in prison. Her husband, now 61, was given six years, three months.

The millionaire owner of Wasps rugby club is a suspect in Scotland Yard’s computer-hacking investigation.

Steve 
Hayes remains on bail after being arrested in Hertfordshire in February 
by detectives from Operation Tuleta, an offshoot of the force’s Weeting 
investigation into illegal activities at News International.

The investigation into Mr Hayes, 50, is not linked to any news organisation or the activities of journalists, sources said.

The 
businessman, who made millions of pounds selling an internet loans 
business, was detained on suspicion of offences under the Computer 
Misuse Act

There have been 46 arrests surrounding inquiries into hacking and corruption under Weeting, Elveden and Tuleta.

A 
Scotland Yard spokesman said: 'On 24 February 2012, officers from 
Operation Tuleta arrested a man at his home in Hertfordshire, and a man 
at an address in Surrey, on suspicion of offences under the Computer 
Misuse Act 1990 and the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act (RIPA) 
2000.

'These arrests are not directly linked to any news organisation or the activities of journalists.

'They were taken to London police stations and later bailed to return in June and July 2012 pending further enquiries.'
