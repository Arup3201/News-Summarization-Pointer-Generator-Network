A British Army officer who was shot dead by an Afghan soldier as he played in a Remembrance Day football match has been named by the Ministry of Defence.

Captain Walter Barrie, 41, from The Royal
Scots Borderers, 1st Battalion The Royal Regiment of Scotland, was 
killed at Forward Operating Base Shawqat in the Nad-e Ali district.

Capt Barrie, from Glasgow, was shot when the traitor opened fire with an AK47 assault rifle as UK and Afghan forces took part in the kickabout.

Last night, the soldier's wife Sonia hailed her husband as a 'great man.'

She said: 'Captain Walter Barrie was great man, a doting and 
amazing father and a fantastic husband. He was much loved and will be 
missed by many.

'The family would ask that their privacy is respected during this very difficult time.'

The MoD also paid tribute to the officer, describing him as 'approachable and compassionate' and a man who 'cared deeply for 
the wellbeing of those around him and had unparalleled rapport with all 
ranks'.

Lieutenant Colonel Benjamin Wrench, commanding officer of the
Royal Scots Borderers, 1st Battalion The Royal Regiment of Scotland, 
said: 'His role as an adviser to the Afghan army was one he trained for,
looked forward to and performed superbly.

'His ability to build 
relationships and rapport has always made an impact on those who met 
him. This was down to his enthusiasm for life, for youth and humanity.

'As
can be seen from the many tributes, he enriched the lives of everybody 
he came across. His winning personality and Glaswegian wit will be 
sorely missed, as will the banter we often had as a result of his 
fanatical support for Glasgow Rangers.

'It is almost impossible to express the sadness we, as a close battalion, are experiencing at this time.

'I
know the impact of his tragic loss will be felt across our regiment, 
amongst the soldiers, officers and in particular the late entry 
commissioned officer community. But we remain committed in our role and 
mission in Afghanistan and we will do so knowing that Walter would 
expect nothing less of us all.'

Lieutenant Colonel Jim 
Archibald, Royal Regiment of Scotland, described Capt Barrie as a' fantastic, engaging and professional man' who was 'universally popular 
and highly capable'.

He added: 'Walter's cutting, 
self-deprecating wit, easy-going manner and endearing personality will 
never be forgotten by all those who had the privilege and pleasure to 
have met and worked with him.Walter's loss will be mourned across 
the Royal Regiment of Scotland. He was exceptional and I am immensely 
proud to have had the privilege of serving alongside him.'

Captain Barrie, who also leaves behind 15-year-old son Callum, has served with the army for 25 years including tours of 
Iraq, Bosnia, Kosovo and Northern Ireland.

He had been deployed to Afghanistan in late August and was playing in the game on an open 
but protected piece of dusty ground at the base which lies between the 
British part of the camp and the headquarters of an Afghan battalion.

The match took place just a few hours after UK soldiers held a Remembrance Day service to honour the fallen.

The
atmosphere was described as ‘friendly’ by military sources. But 
suddenly an Afghan soldier, named as Mohammad Ashraf, went berserk with 
an AK47 and fired at the British troops.

Ashraf was wounded after comrades of Captain Barrie chased after him and opened fire.

He was last night being treated at the British hospital at Camp Bastion, awaiting questioning.

Sources said he was not playing football and is not thought to have been a spectator.

Nato’s
International Security Assistance Force is investigating whether the 
killer’s brother was responsible for an attack which injured a Spanish 
soldier in western Afghanistan on Saturday.

Sunday’s attack in Helmand 
will add to concerns about how thoroughly the Afghan security forces are
vetted.

Yesterday the 
Ministry of Defence confirmed that two troops shot dead last month – 
female Army medic Corporal Channing Day, 25, and Corporal David 
O’Connor, 27, a Royal Marine – were also killed by a renegade Afghan 
policeman.

Fourteen British 
troops have been killed by their Afghan allies this year – almost one in
three of all fatalities. A total of 438 UK troops have lost their lives
since the war began in 2001.

General
Syed Malook Safi, of the Afghan National Army’s 215 Maiwand Corps, said
Ashraf had been posted to Helmand two months ago.

He
said: ‘They were having some kind of football match. The British and 
Afghan soldiers do this sometimes when they have finished their work. 
There is shared ground and every day the ANA and Brits mix and they play
soccer in this ground, and volleyball and cricket.’

Ahmad
Zirak, spokesman for the Helmand provincial governor, said: ‘I can tell
you it was not the enemies; the ANA soldier who opened fire was not a 
member of the Taliban. There were some private problems between him and 
the British soldiers.’

The 
spate of deaths, which have increased dramatically this year, have sown 
deep distrust between foreign forces and the Afghan forces they are 
supposed to be supporting.

At least 54 international troops have died as a result of ‘green on blue’ attacks.
