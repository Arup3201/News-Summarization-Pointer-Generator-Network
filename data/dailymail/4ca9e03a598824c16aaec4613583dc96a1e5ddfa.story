One in three rioters who brought terror and destruction to the streets of London went on to commit crimes including murder, rape and robbery, figures revealed yesterday.

Some 1,593 of the 3,914 thugs charged or cautioned following the disturbances of August 2011 have reoffended.

Among the near-6,000 fresh crimes they notched up in the three years since the riots were 12 killings, 180 serious assaults such as wounding and 151 crimes involving a weapon.

But although some rioters are still in jail for offences committed during the lawlessness, the vast majority have either been freed or given non-custodial sentences.

The statistics sparked fresh calls for the authorities to get a better ‘grip’ on young men entrenched in a life of violent crime and warnings that failing to keep career criminals under control is putting people in danger.

The figures are also likely to be echoed in other cities struck by rioting that spread from the capital, including Bristol, Birmingham and Manchester.

A breakdown of figures released under the Freedom of Information Act reveal a total of 5,878 new crimes committed by the London rioters. Of these, 1,172 were violent offences – including 314 ‘assault with injury’ crimes, 171 common assaults and 265 cases of harassment.

Along with 21 rapes, there were also 719 burglaries, 451 robberies and 1,075 thefts. Some 1,819 drug offences included 221 trafficking charges, and there were 36 frauds and 213 cases of vandalism. Incredibly, one rioter went on to commit 72 new crimes.

The data also reveals how 168 of the 1,593 reoffenders in London belonged to gangs. Some 107 people – 17 of them gangsters – committed ten or more new offences.

SELFIES and online messaging are creating a generation of youngsters who are ‘kinder’ and less likely to commit crime, Boris Johnson has claimed.

The London Mayor said concerns that smartphones and handheld games consoles were turning children into ‘lidless lizards’ could be ‘more or less entirely dismissed’.

He argued that gadgets gave the young ‘endless opportunities’ for self-expression and communication that kept them from being ‘sucked into crime’.

In a speech on technology in Boston during a whirlwind tour of the US, Mr Johnson said: ‘I would say that on the whole the younger generation are nicer, kinder, more well-balanced and more emotionally literate than my lot ever were.’

He said while young men are typically drawn into crime because of ‘anger, low self-esteem and a sense of social exclusion’, selfies, texts and shared videos provided by handheld gizmos offer ‘myriad pipette drops of self-affirmation’.

He referred to technology as a ‘liberator’ that gives voters the right to vent their feelings every day, adding: ‘I see no evidence whatever that tech is coarsening or depraving the young people of today.’ 

A total of 261 rioters, including 49 gang members, carried out between five and ten more crimes. 

London’s Deputy Mayor Stephen Greenhalgh, said urgent changes were needed to protect the public by keeping a better ‘grip’ on offenders.

He called for New York-style reforms that would put City Hall in overall control of the capital’s entire criminal justice system.

He said the figures proved that the riots in 2011 were fuelled by ‘prolific offenders rather than low-level opportunists’.

‘Even though the police have learnt the lessons of the riots, the wider criminal justice system needs to up its game and stop playing pass the parcel with these violent criminals,’ he warned.

‘We need to grip these offenders. Many have not been deterred, despite prosecuting them more quickly in 2011, and have gone on to rape and murder in some cases.’

The Metropolitan Police said it is working hard to reduce reoffending, but the responsibility for monitoring freed criminals fell mainly to other agencies.

Rioters plunged much of Britain into chaos over several days in August 2011, looting shops, torching buildings and terrorising neighbourhoods. 

The unrest began in the capital and was sparked by the killing of Mark Duggan, who was shot dead by police in Tottenham, north London, on August 4.

However, the rioting quickly spread to other parts of London and Britain, with Birmingham, Bristol and Manchester all hit by 'copycat violence' over the subsequent days.

A Ministry of Justice spokesman said: 'Re-offending has been too high for too long and we are introducing wide-reaching reforms to the way offenders are managed to tackle this unacceptable issue.

'This year, for the first time, all prisoners will receive at least 12 months rehabilitation on release to tackle their criminal behaviour. 

'This includes those on short sentences who have the highest re-offending rates and up until now have received no statutory post-prison support.

'This will be vital in cutting crime and making our communities safer.' 

 The figures, released by Scotland Yard, show that the offences were committed between the aftermath of the riots and the end of last year. The re-offenders included 168 gang members, the police figures revealed
