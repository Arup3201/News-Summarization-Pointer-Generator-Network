She wore a bright smile on her face as she arrived at LAX airport on Monday, but Paris Hilton seems to be going through a trying time.

The 33-year-old heiress - who was raised a Roman Catholic - and her father Rick Hilton have both been targeted on Instagram and Facebook by a man who has posted several abusive anti-Semitic messages to the pair.

According to TMZ, police are now investigating after the Hiltons allegedly received such posts as: 'I know ur Jew family gives nothing,' and another stated: 'KILL JEWS FOR FUN (sic)'

Trying time: Paris Hilton looks happy despite police reportedly investigating the anti-Semitic messages she has received online by a stalker

A post to Rick said: 'one month and she's dead, she's never coming home. (sic)', while another message read: 'I'll beat u and that bitch to unconscious.(sic)'

The man is also alleged to have threatened to sexually assault the 33-year-old star.

The Los Angeles Police Department has obtained a warrant to try to track down the man on the social media sites and believe they know who he is.

This is not the first time Paris has been hit with death threats. In May 2007, the hotel heiress was sentenced to a 45-day jail term and before the stretch was due to start in June that year she was said to be inundated with threats from inmates.

An insider said at the time: 'These maniacs have been writing, "We're going to get you," and, "I'm going to kill you." It's horrifying.

'One person wrote that she's going to steal Paris' shoes when she gets to jail--and if Paris argues, she'll be beaten to a pulp.'

Paris said: 'I'm very scared right now.'

She was spotted with her Chihuahua Peter Pan at LAX airport after arriving on a flight.
