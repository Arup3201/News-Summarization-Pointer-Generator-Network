The adoring parents of a two-year-old were horrified when they were told their son was a health and safety risk because he is too tall.

Staff at the Jolly Roger Adventure play centre in Swindon, Wiltshire, said Dylan Kennedy and Amanda Sparks would have to pay extra for son Oliver to attend the nursery because he is 3ft 3ins (100cm) tall.

Managers said that, at five-and-a-half inches (14cm) above the average height for a child his age, Oliver would 'wear out equipment faster' than the other toddlers.

Wrong fit: Amanda Sparks was told she would have to pay extra for son Oliver to attend the Jolly Roger Adventure play centre because he is taller than an average toddler

Mrs Sparks, 24, was told that she would have to pay a full child price of £3.60 for Oliver instead 
of the under-four admission fee of £2.20.

The youngster's angry parents have hit back at the play centre, saying their son was being discriminated against because he had grown slightly faster than most children his age.

Mr Kennedy, 30, said: 'Ollie is tall for his age but, because he is asthmatic, he has had to take steroids from a young age which has probably made him grow a bit quicker.

'To me it just seems like complete discrimination against my son for being tall.

'He is only two so he is definitely still a toddler. I would say you probably stop being a toddler at about four years old, when you start school. 

'They go there almost every week and he even had his second birthday party there last year.

Unfair: Oliver, who is 5.5in taller than the average two-year-old, is allowed to play in the same area as other toddlers but his parents must pay extra for the privilege

'On their latest visit, Amanda went to pay the normal toddler price and was told she would have to pay more.

'She paid it because she didn’t want Ollie to know she was disappointed because he was so excited. But when they queried it afterwards with the manager they were told, "If you have a tall child then it is just tough".'

Appalled: Oliver's mother was told her son was a 'health and safety risk' at 3ft 3in (100cm) tall

Mr Kennedy emailed the management team the same day and was told that the decision had been made for health and safety reasons. 

He added: 'It’s not really about the price, it is more about the attitude that we have been given.'

A friend’s daughter, who is one month younger than Oliver, was able to enter as a toddler.

Mrs Sparks said: 'Last time we measured him he was about 100cm tall, so he is quite tall for his age, but he does have these steroids, and I am quite tall too.

'When they measured him he just came right up to the line, but that was because his hair was all spiked up.

'It just seems unfair when my friend’s daughter, who is just a month younger than Oliver, is classed as a toddler.

'He can still play in the toddler area once he is inside because that is done on age, but the price is done on height, which doesn’t seem fair to me.'

On the Jolly Roger website it states that the toddlers' area is exclusively for children under four years old or 95cm in height. Oliver will not be three for another two months, but already exceeds the specified height by 5cm.

Manager John Bolton said: 'We do go by height at Jolly Roger - a bigger child would wear the equipment out quicker than a smaller child would.

'But if an older child wants to play with their younger brother or sister in the toddler area then we wouldn’t stop this, as we want the children to be happy and play together, so we can mix and match.

'We would never stop friends playing together because of their height - that is not what we are about.

'We try to be as accommodating as we can and make the play areas as safe as possible.'
