He's already been married twice.

But that didn't stop Bill Murray from giving relationship advice after crashing a bachelor's party in Charleston, South Carolina.

The 63-year-old offered some words of wisdom to the groom and his friends at a steakhouse over Memorial Day weekend, captured on a video obtained by Deadspin.

Cheeky: He starts off my asking the men, who hail from Boston College, whether they approve of their friend's bride-to-be

Sage advice: Bill Murray imparted some words of wisdom after crashing a bachelor's party over Memorial Day weekend in Charleston, South Carolina

According to the website's Concourse blog, one of the groom's friends spotted Murray sitting downstairs.

They asked the waiter to send the actor free drinks, but Murray declined. One of the friends then went up to Murray and asked if he would say a few words to the groom, whose name was EJ.

Murray initially said no, but much to the mens' delight, the star emerged and proceeded to dispense with some marriage advice.

Nice surprise! The partygoers seemed giddy with excitement at having the famous actor crash their party 

He starts off by asking the men, who hail from Boston College, whether they approve of their friend's bride-to-be.

'What do you think, thumbs up on her or not?' he asks, to which the friends laugh and answer yes.

Murray then goes on to give some sage advice, seemingly off-the-cuff. 

Good advice! Murray suggests you take your love on a trip around the world before deciding if they're the one

Having fun: Murray playfully put his head in his hands at one point while the men cheered

'You know how funerals are not for the dead, they're for the living? Bachelor parties are not for the groom, they're for the uncommitted,' he told the unmarried men.

He then explained how to figure out if the person you're with is right for you.

'If you have someone that you think is The One, don't just sort of think in your ordinary mind, "Okay, let's pick a date. Let's plan this and make a party and get married,"' he said.

'Take that person and travel around the world. Buy a plane ticket for the two of you to travel all around the world, and go to places that are hard to go to and hard to get out of. And if when you come back to JFK, when you land in JFK, and you're still in love with that person, get married at the airport.'

He then picked up the groom and hoisted him over his shoulder while the men cheered.

An auspicious beginning! Murray spoke directly to EJ, the groom, before hoisting him over his shoulder

Murray has been married twice previously, first to Margaret Kelly, from 1981 to 1996, and then to Jennifer Butler, whom he divorced in 2008 after 11 years of marriage.

Prior to their split, Butler accused Murray of physical abuse, alcohol addiction and infidelity.

She said she felt forced to move the couple's four sons to a new home as a result of his various issues.

Bill Murray is legendary for his unusual and creative interactions with the public. So much so that they have become modern day urban myths. Each story usually ends with the Hollywood actor telling his flumoxed fans 'No one will ever believe you'. Indeed, so prevalent have Bill Murray stories become that a website has been created to collect them all.

1 - Bill Seybot recounts one story when he left his laptop open at a Starbucks while he left to get a drink. When he returned, Billy Murray was sitting in front of the screen, using the computer. Stunned, Seybot says that he simply let Murray continue whatever it was he was doing before standing up, saying, 'No one will ever believe you' and walked off

2 - On another occasion a group of friends were in New York City karaoke bar, One 7, when in walked Bill Murray with a female friend. They invited the Ghostbusters actor into their booth, but he politely declined. Fifteen minutes later he walked in and bought drinks for everyone and proceeded to sing an Elvis song and then just as promptly as he arrived, left.

3 - In 2010, Bill Mrray was at Austin's SXSW festival with members of the Wu-Tang clan. He arrived at the city's Shangri-La bar and insisted on bartending. However no matter what they order he would only pour them tequila and lots of it.

4 - In 2006, Bill Murray was in St. Andrews, Scotland, for a golf tournament when he went out drinking. He bumped into Swedish student Lykke Stavnef, who invited him to a party. However, instead of dancing away the night, Murray decided to clean up all the student apartment's entire dirty plates.

5 - One New Yorker claims that he and his little brother were in Little Italy in the Bronx when they noticed Bill Murray in the same restaurant as them. He was eating pasta and had a bag of unopened chips next to him. One of the brothers was aware of Murray's unusual reputation for strange behavior so walked up to him, opened his chips, began to eat them and said, 'No one will ever believe you!' and walked away. Murray broke into raucous laughter and walked over to the men and gave them both a big hug.
