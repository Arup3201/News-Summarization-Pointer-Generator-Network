David Moyes has admitted he wants to bring in several loan reinforcements at Real Sociedad in January increasing the chances of Adnan Januzaj moving to Spain in the winter transfer window.

Asked about likely first signings as Real Sociedad coach Moyes said: 'The president has been very good with me and he is going to let me see what I can do. My intention is maybe going into the loan market to bring in a couple of players on loan. If I can boost the squad and give everybody a lift then I will try to do that.'

Moyes brought Januzaj through at Old Trafford and with the Belgian international out of favour under Louis van Gaal a move could suit all parties.

Adnan Januzaj could be reunited with David Moyes when the transfer window re-opens in January

Januzaj has made 11 appearances for United this season... but could be allowed to leave for Spain

'January is never the best time but if there are boys who could come here and help the team and we can have a look at them for six months then we'll do that,' he said after Sunday's draw with Athletic Bilbao.

A central midfielder and a striker will also be on the former United manager's wanted list. Carlos Vela has already scored four goals for his new manager but alongside him 7.5m euros club record signing Alfred Finnbogason is yet to come any where close to justifying his fee.

Moyes said: 'I have told him that sometimes the goals are the last thing to come. Everybody wants it to be the first thing but the first thing has to be what you do for the team. Hard workers are always respected. Vela was exceptional against Athletic Bilbao and we had to try to get the ball to him more in the second and we couldn't.'

Moyes is looking to add to his Real Sociedad squad in the new year

The Scot says British clubs would benefit from a winter break after the FA Cup third round matches 

Real Sociedad play a second leg Spanish cup last-16 match on Wednesday at home to third tier side Oviedo. The teams drew 0-0 in the first leg. Moyes then takes his team to play Levante at the weekend and will then experience his first winter break.

'I have always been an advocate of it,' he said. 'If you play in the Premier League then you have to accept that football is played over the Christmas and New Year period but I think we should have a break after the first game in January, after the FA Cup.

'That's when people have the least amount of cash in their pocket and when the players have just made a huge effort over Christmas so I have always thought that two weeks then would be ideal for British clubs.

'It is a different scenario here. It will be the first Christmas I have had with my family I although I imagine I'll probably end up watching a game somewhere on Boxing Day.'
