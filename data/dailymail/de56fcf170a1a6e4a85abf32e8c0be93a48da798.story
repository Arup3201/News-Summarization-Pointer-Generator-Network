A great-grandmother could become Britain's longest council house tenant after staying in the same home for the last 82 years.

Emma May Haines, 90, moved into the £85,000 house in Tipton, near Dudley, when she was just eight years old in 1931.

She originally lived with her grandparents, Ruth and Joseph Morris, her mother Emma Bradley, and her brother Thomas.

They moved into the house after her mother was widowed when Mrs Haines' father, George, died of pneumonia.

The family had to pay a 10 shilling 
deposit to secure the mid-terrace home and when she first moved in as a child the family didn’t have 
any electricity, only gas.

The family did not own a radio until she 
was 14 years old, while a television did not arrive until Mrs Haines, a retired fruit shop
worker, was
in her early 30s.

So happy was Mrs Haines in the house she moved her
husband Stanley into the property giving birth to a daughter, Carol, 
two years later. But she was to lose her mother the following year in 
1946.

Carol eventually moved out of the address when she was 21 and 
gave the couple five granddaughters, Donna, Vicky, Kerry, Suzanne and 
Laura.

They have gone onto have 12 children of their own - aged between two and 20.

Mrs Haines and her husband remained together at the house until he died 10 years ago.

Daughter Carol tragically then passed away three year later in 2005, aged 60.

May says she has continued to live at the council house because of the 'cherished memories' she has of life there.

She said: ‘I've been happy since I've been here. My husband and I had a very happy family and a very happy life.

‘I've got decent neighbours, and I never considered moving or applied for anything else.

Unchanged: Mrs Haines, pictured in her 30s, says she has a lot of cherished memories and does not want to move out

‘When
I was first here we were all poor, but we all pulled together. We had 
good neighbours then and I’ve got good neighbours now.

‘There's no-one on this estate left from when they were first built, just me.

‘There
are memories that I've got here - we've had some bad times and hard 
times when we were younger, but families work together.

‘I've had a happy life here, and hope to end my time here.’

Happy memories: Mrs Haines, a retired fruit shop worker, would like to spend the remainder of her life in the house

Council estate: The house was part of a council estate completed in 1931. Mrs Haines' family have been its only occupants since it was built

Mrs Haines added she was proud to live in an era when families spent more time with one another.

‘It was different in those days, we used to have to go and fetch the coal on a Saturday morning.

‘We
used to drag a little barrel or trolley and fetch it and if we used to 
do that our parents used to give us tuppence to go to the pictures,’ she
said.

‘There was no television in the early days - we played hopscotch and top and whip.

‘It was nice to go out and play when we were kids, it was safe, you could play in the street, we were never in the house.

‘Although
it’s all computer games that the kids are into now - I was very proud 
to have lived in an era when families spent much more time with one 
another.’
