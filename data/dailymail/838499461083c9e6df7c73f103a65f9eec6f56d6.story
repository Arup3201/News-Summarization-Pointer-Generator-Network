There’s no need to worry about being caught short on this particular walking tour of London.

The ‘London Loo Tour’ sees walkers shepherded round a selection of toilets in the capital being given the lowdown on the best places to go.

Conceived by American guide Rachel Erickson, who was so frustrated by not being able to 'pee for free', the not so bog standard tour takes curious loo finders from all over the world and guides them around a variety of toilets and areas relating to sewerage history in the capital.

The most patriotic loos ever? The Jubiloos not only have Union Jack toilet seats but attendants with Union Jack waistcoats too

Close your eyes and think of the Queen: The 'Jubaloos' success is probably down to the fact that they are so well-cared for

The tour starts at the toilets by platform 19 at WaterLOO Station (geddit?) and can accommodate up to 20 guests while Rachel also offers 'singles' and private tours.

Each tour is packed with unusual and little-known facts like brief histories on how the Romans managed their toilet, and the plumber who founded one of London’s early sanitary engineering companies, Thomas Crapper and Co.

Weaving through the streets, walkers visit such locations as the patriotic 'Juba-loos' on the South Bank.

Built for the Queen’s Diamond Jubilee and designed by architect Mark Power, the toilet costs 50p to use and has full-time attendants who are hard to miss in their Union Jack waistcoats. It also makes use of rainwater to flush toilets and wash floors.

Next the whislte-stop tour takes people to the day urinals for men in Charing Cross and pop-up urinals in Charing Cross.

The magic circle: The 'Urilift' rises from the ground in the evenings to encourage men out on the town not to relieve themselves on the streets

You're in trouble now: The men only, pop-up 'Butterfly' urinals in Charing Cross are a stainless steel design - but not so private

Just around the corner outside Embankment Garden is the mysterious 'Urilift' – one of three urinals provided by Westminster that rise up from the ground in the evenings to offer an alternative option for late-night male revellers.

The Urilift contributes to keeping 10,000 gallons of wee off the streets of Westminster, explains Erickson.

Another, more permanent example of a street urinal is the Butterfly outside Charing Cross Station. Its slick stainless steel design aims to please, with a view to prevent men weeing on the street - albeit with minimal privacy.

The guide has a wealth of stories about the history of public conveniences, for example the difficulties of providing public conveniences for women in the Victorian Era.

Toilet humour required? Rachel Erickson gives tourists the lowdown on loos in her deadpan style

Pee on earth:  Waterloo is well-catered for when it comes to the smallest room: Platform 19 ladies toilets, left, are a favourite, while The Hole in the Wall community toilets at Waterloo, right. are for those in the know

Get to the bottom of it: The enthusiastic tour guide takes interested parties through the back streets of London, dispensing historical information about the loos of London

Loo within a loo: The Cellardoor cocktail bar in Aldwych used to be a mens toilet frequented by Oscar Wilde

Female toilets were highly controversial, indeed many people thought they were an ‘abomination’ and would be used by flower girls cleaning their watercress apparently. The most successful were the ones that were discreetly located underground.

Toilets for gentlemen were far more common and the underground toilets at St. Paul’s, Covent Garden are included in the tour, as are the gentleman’s loos at the Royal Exchange - which even had a sonnet dedicated to them.

Pull up a stool: London's only Sewer Gas Destructor Lamp was a gas lamp powered solely by sewerage gas

Toilet hero: The monument to Joseph Bazelgette, who designed the first sewerage system for London on Embankment

Also on the agenda is a stop at a lamp near to the Savoy hotel which was powered by gas from the sewerage system in Central London almost a century ago.

The walk concludes at the end of the Strand at underground toilets regularly frequented by Oscar Wilde that have now been converted into a cocktail bar.

Other pub stops include a Community Loo Scheme participant; Ye Olde London is one of 75 establishments paid £600 each year by the City of London to cater for people's basic needs.

When you consider that the average person spends about an average of a year and a half on the toilet, perhaps you won't be so quick to pooh pooh the tour.
