Charlene Tyler (pictured) said she felt 'violated' after a photo of her legs was used in the sting operation

A Sunday newspaper accused of turning two unsuspecting women into 'honey traps' to ensnare sex-shame MP Brooks Newmark was attacked by a Cabinet minister yesterday.

Education Secretary Nicky Morgan said the Sunday Mirror should not have used 'selfie' photos from the internet of a Swedish model and a Lincolnshire mother of two without their consent. 

The photos were used as part of a 'sting' operation which resulted in married Mr Newmark quitting the Government after being caught sending an X-rated photo of himself.

Mrs Morgan said: 'It is not right that photos are taken without consent from anybody. 

'The paper will have to think about their conduct.'

London Mayor Boris Johnson said: 'I have a very high regard for Brooks and a great deal of sympathy and I am sure he will be coming back very soon.' 

But Home Secretary Theresa May had little sympathy, saying: 'Brooks shouldn't have done it in the first place.'

Amid a growing row over the Sunday Mirror's story, police and the new press regulator are being asked to investigate. 

There has been no further word from father-of-five Mr Newmark since he declared himself a 'complete fool' for posting explicit photos of himself to a woman he thought was an attractive blonde Conservative supporter – but who was really a male undercover reporter.

The 56-year-old MP resigned as Minister for Civil Society at the weekend after realising that 'Sophie' was in fact a fake Twitter account set up as a honey trap.

He sent 'Sophie' an X-rated photo of himself after apparently requesting 'she' send photos to him – one of which showed the legs of mother-of-two Charlene Tyler, 26, from Lincolnshire, and the other the face of Swedish model Malin Sahlen, 22.

Yesterday Miss Tyler said she felt 'violated' and feared people would think she had been a willing partner in the sting. 

She told the Mail: 'This was a violation of my privacy. I know I put photos on Twitter for the world to see but there needs to be some level of respect.'

She added: 'I don't like the fact they used one of my photos to bring someone down. 

'He's a grown man and he may be married but the only people who should be concerned about what he's done are him and his wife.'

Miss Sahlen told a Swedish newspaper she felt 'exploited' by her picture being used as the profile photo on the Twitter account.

'I have had a lot of emails, texts and phonecalls from different countries about it. It feels unreal,' she told Aftonbladet.

'I do not want to be used this way and that someone has used my picture this way feels so horrible, both for me and others involved in this.' 

She also took to her blog to inform her followers of her photo being used as the 'face' of the operation. 

The Twitter profile picture of 'Sophie Wittams', who is really a Swedish model uninvolved in the sting. The model, whose real name is Malin Sahlen, 22, said it was 'offensive' her image was used without permission

This picture of 'Miss Wittam's' legs - actually Charlene Tyler's - was used as the journalist encouraged Mr Newmark to send explicit images. Miss Tyler said the MP had nothing to be ashamed of and should not resign

She wrote: 'I feel very confused right now and still can't comprehend that what has happened has happened. I can blog more about this another day, but right now I can't bare to talk about it.

‘This thing feels really unpleasant.’ 

Lloyd Embley, editor in chief of the Sunday Mirror, last night apologised to the two women.

Anger: A photo by 'Sophie Wittams' was in fact of unsuspecting Charlene Tyler, from Lincolnshire

He said: 'At no point has the Sunday Mirror published any of these images. 

'But we would like to apologise to the women involved for their use in the investigation.'

The newspaper has defended its story as having a 'nailed-on public interest', because Mr Newmark is a founder of the Women2Win campaign group which aims to attract more women into politics.

Associate editor Kevin Maguire said: 'If you have the minister for civic society, a minister charged with getting more women into politics but seems to be [more interested] in getting them into his own bed, I think there is huge public interest.' 

But the undercover investigation – conducted by a freelancer and sold to the Sunday Mirror – also targeted other MPs and has been branded a 'fishing expedition' by critics.

Mark Pritchard – one of at least six other Tory MPs targeted – said he was reporting the newspaper to the Metropolitan Police and to the three-week-old successor to the Press Complaints Commission, the Independent Press Standards Organisation (Ipso), saying it would be 'the first real test as to whether the new body, Ipso, has any teeth'.

Lawyers and media commentators accused the newspaper of 'entrapment' and questioned whether tricking Mr Newmark into sending the photo amounted to the crime of 'causing a person to indulge in sexual activity without consent'.

Before the Sunday Mirror ran the story, it was turned down by both The Sun and The Mail on Sunday.
