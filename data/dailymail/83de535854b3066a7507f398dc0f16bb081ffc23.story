Married Lauren Silverman kept her trysts with Simon Cowell secret by telling her unsuspecting husband she was going to Miami to visit her mother, it has been claimed.

Lauren, 36, would allegedly sneak off with the music mogul by telling his friend Andrew Silverman she was visiting her mother, Carole Saland, then she would rendezvous with secret lover Cowell, 53.

A source told the New York Post: 'Interesting that Lauren used her mother as her cover story.'

Furore: The X Factor star is having a baby with Lauren Silverman, a married New York socialite

Lauren's mother has staunchly defended 
her daughter who has been labelled a 'gold-digger', and has had to 
weather claims she is only interested in X Factor boss Cowell's wealth.

Mrs Saland said: 'Lauren isn’t a gold-digger... She’s a nice girl from Miami Beach. 
Her marriage was not a marriage made in heaven and life goes on, people 
go on.'

Another source claimed that Lauren had talked to Andrew to try to save the relationship 'possibly to take them over 
the ten-year mark'  as stipulated in their pre-nuptial agreement.

But
 in June, Lauren flew to England for the final of Cowell’s show 
Britain’s Got Talent, at which time it is believed she became pregnant,
 after which there was clearly no going back.

On Monday night Cowell was believed to be on the way to the UK to visit his own mother, Julie Cowell.

As MailOnline revealed, the X Factor 
supremo, 53, flew out of Los Angeles on Friday to watch his band One 
Direction in concert in Las Vegas on Saturday night before heading to 
Europe, where he will spend the month on board the Slipstream yacht, 
touring St Tropez.

He 
is believed to want to give his lover space in order to work out her 
divorce case with her husband and is keen to avoid an ugly court battle, and keep any embarrassing secrets from being exposed.

The
 New York Post reported Lauren waited until her 10th wedding 
anniversary to break the news of her affair with Cowell to her husband 
so the terms of her pre-nup would kick in.

And
 a source again insisted today that Lauren tried to 'max out her return 
by stringing things along past the 10 year mark to increase what she 
would be eligible to receive.

He’s
 then expected to head to St. Tropez and vacation with friends on a 
yacht - as pregnant Lauren continues her uncomfortable holiday 
in the Hamptons with her son Adam, seven and her estranged husband.

The
 couple have been holed up at her family home, trying to maintain a 
semblance of normality for their son.

Yesterday, sources told MailOnline that all sides, particularly Simon -  want the divorce settled as soon as 
possible, freeing Lauren to be with Cowell.

A settlement could come as 
early as this week and she is expected to take less than the $4 million 
set out in their pre-nuptial agreement - perhaps reflecting Lauren broke a 'cheating clause'.

Bernard Clair, one of 
Lauren’s lawyers, said: 'These cheap shots aimed at Lauren and her 
family by people who believe they are supporting Andrew serve only to 
sabotage ongoing efforts by our client and her husband to settle this 
matter.

'We and Lauren continue to be committed to resolving this matter 
privately and amicably.'

A spokesoman for Andrew referred the Post to his 
initial statement, which said: 'My top priority is protecting my 
7-year-old son while working to resolve all outstanding issues with my 
wife.'

The 36-year-old
 socialite, who is expecting a baby with the music mogul, has held 
'productive conversations' with her estranged husband as they continue 
to thrash out their divorce agreement.

And
 the couple - who spent the weekend locked in talks at their rental home 
in the Hamptons - are also working on plans to share custody of their 
seven-year-old son Adam.

On Monday a source told MailOnline: 'There have been productive conversations over the weekend.

'Lauren and Andrew are intent on resolving this - and Simon also wants it resolved.'

Lauren was seen outside the Bridgehampton home yesterday where she is staying with her husband and son.

The striking brunette, wearing a sweatshirt and baseball cap, smiled as her son was picked up for summer camp.

She
 then headed to lunch with a friend in nearby Southampton, where she had
 donned a clingy striped sun dress, with a black bikini top underneath.

Lauren
 is now being represented by Bernard Clair - named as one of '10 lawyers
 you don't want representing your spouse in a divorce' - by Business Insider.

Mr
 Clair famously represented socialite Jocelyn Wildenstein in her divorce
 from Alec Nathan Wildensteain, New York designer Carolyn Roehm, and 
Republican fundraiser Georgette Mosbacher.

While Andrew Silverman is being represented Jeffrey Cohen of Cohen Goldstein Silpe. As previously revealed, his parents Eleanora and Allen refused to attend the wedding in 2003 in the fabulously elegant old-money confines of the St Regis hotel in Manhattan’s Midtown.

According to a friend, the Silvermans 'did not approve of the relationship, they didn't have a good feeling about Lauren and the relationship.'

Lauren did her utmost to take her mind off her situation over
 the weekend, as she headed out for a spot of retail therapy.

She wore a fitted yellow minidress as she was joined by her sister 
and son Adam as the group browsed the local shops in Bridgehampton, New 
York.

Lauren's outing 
came as Cowell headed to St Tropez, where he is expected to spend the 
next month alongside ex-girlfriends including Sinitta.

Laying low: Simon Cowell left his Los Angeles home on Friday night for a month-long trip to Europe

Cowell will 
tour Europe and take time to evaluate how exactly to proceed after it 
was revealed last week that New York socialite Lauren - married to his 
friend Andrew - is expecting his baby.

Ironically,
 it was on board the $458,000-a-week Slipstream that Cowell was pictured
 sharing a tender embrace with Lauren last August, in images that came 
to light last week.

A
 friend close to Andrew Silverman told the New York Post that the idea that Andrew knew about his wife's relationship with Cowell is 'ridiculous' and 'she 
knows this isn't true.'

Andrew's friend said that it sounds like a 'desperate attempt to smear him.'

The statement was in response to an earlier TMZ report that said Andrew knew about the affair all along.

Break: Cowell was spotted leaving Los Angeles on his private jet on Friday night

The
 website reported that Lauren has alleged to close friends that Andrew 
'knew what was going on the whole time and he was doing the same thing.'

While
 Lauren's pregnancy is still in early days, Cowell is said to be 
concerned about the strain the situation and the resulting publicity may put on the 
socialite.

The
 pair are in a relationship, as MailOnline revealed, but 
another friend said: 'At the moment, Lauren and Andrew need to thrash 
out their divorce - Lauren can't just go running off to be with Simon, 
as much as she wants to be with him.

'All sides want the divorce to go through as quickly as can be.'

It remains to be seen just how Cowell will cope with fatherhood. He has never 
made a secret of the fact that wasn't keen on having children.

In an interview in 2009, Cowell said: 'God, no. I couldn't have children. If I had them here drawing on the walls I'd go nuts.

However,
interestingly, in April this year, Cowell appeared to have mellowed saying: 'I haven’t ruled it out. If I knew I 
could be - how do I put this delicately - faithful, I would.'
