A couple getting married have been brought down to earth with a bang after the hot-air balloon they hired for the ceremony crash-landed.

Shortly after Jonathon and Kerin Narcisse exchanged 'I dos,' the basket began to swing like a pendulum - with the entire wedding party inside it - and the pilot was forced to bring it down in a backyard in Rancho Penasquitos, San Diego late on Monday afternoon.

The balloon crash-landed around 5 p.m. but no one was seriously injured, according to the local fire department.Â
