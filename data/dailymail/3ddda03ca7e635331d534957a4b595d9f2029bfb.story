Troubled actor Philip Seymour Hoffman had found himself in a love triangle not long before his drug overdose death, it was revealed today.

Writing in his private diaries, the 46-year-old Hollywood star talked about feeling 'caught in between' long-time girlfriend Mimi O'Donnell and another woman he had recently met.

Hoffman's journal entries suggested that his relationship with his unidentified new paramour may have triggered his split from O’Donnell, who asked him to move out of their Manhattan home three months before his death.

Law enforcement sources told The New York Post's Page Six that O'Donnell did not want Hoffman around their three young children while he was using drugs. 

In his often incoherent 'secret diaries,' Hoffman had described being troubled by 'demons,' wrote about drug deals, and his struggle to overcome his addiction with Narcotics Anonymous meetings.

Some of the entries appear to have been written while in rehab for heroin abuse, while others are scrambled and illegible, with sentences running into each other as though he was high when he put pen to paper. 

According to NBC News, New York City police who searched the actor's West Village apartment after he was found dead February 2 discovered two small diaries, one measuring about 6 by 8 inches and another approximately 7 by 9 inches.

Diaries: Philip Seymour Hoffman, pictured at Sundance in January, had described being troubled by 'demons' in his private journal in the months before his death, it emerged Tuesday

Drug deals: In the diaries, the late actor, pictured with his two daughters Tallulah and Willa, wrote about drug deals, and his struggle to overcome his addiction with Narcotics Anonymous meetings

The network's sources said the hand-scrawled contents often start off clearly and end up impossible to read.

They referenced buying drugs and his battle with his 'demons.'

The Oscar-winning actor also reportedly said he felt 'ashamed that he was going out and hanging out and drinking' after being clean for two decades.

'It's stream of consciousness and difficult to follow,' one source said. 'In one line he refers to "Frank who always owes money" and on the same page he writes about a 15-year-old girl from Texas.'

Another source told NBC: 'It seems he did at least part of it in rehab. It definitely contained some soul-searching. But there is also a fair amount of rambling that doesn't make sense.'

Hoffman entered rehab for at least 10 days in 2013, admitting that his use of prescription drugs had escalated to heroin.

News of the diaries comes after a drug dealer charged in connection with the beloved character actor's tragic death claimed he could have saved his life.

In a jailhouse interview on Rikers Island, Robert Vineberg, a jazz musician and fellow junkie, denied selling Hoffman the drugs that killed him, insisting he hadn't seen the star since October or even heard from him since December.

'I could've saved him,' Vineberg told The New York Post. 'If I knew he was in town, I would've said, "Hey, let's make an AA meeting." If I was with him, it wouldn't have happened. Not under my guard.'

Vineberg said he had known Hoffman for about a year and the pair were friends, getting together to talk about books and art.

'He was a normal guy. You wouldn’t know he was an Oscar winner,' he said.

But he said the actor was a 'hardcore addict' with a 10 bag-a-day heroin habit.

The performer, who has worked with 
Madonna, Wyclef Jean and the late Amy Winehouse, said he last saw 
Hoffman in October, when the actor was high at his Mott Street 
apartment, where police arrested him last week.

After that, things seemed to be looking up for the actor.

He went on a 28-day rehab stint before flying to Atlanta to shoot the upcoming 'Hunger Games' movie.

'He left me a voicemail in December saying, "I'm clean,"' he said of their final contact.

Hoffman
 was found dead in his bathroom a week ago with 73 bags of heroin 
scattered around his West Village apartment. He still had a syringe in 
his arm, it was reported.

But
 Vineberg, 57, denied supplying him with the drugs that killed him. When
 The Post asked if he had ever sold Hoffman drugs, he refused to answer.

He said he was 'devastated' by Hoffman's death and offered his condolences to his family.

He suggested his brief stint off the drugs may have made him more susceptible to overdose.

'When
 you're clean for that long of a time, your body can't take as much,' 
Vineberg said. 'Your body doesn't have the tolerance.'

He added: 'He was a hard-core addict.'

He is convinced that Hoffman was injecting 10 bags a day.

'How much was he found with? Seventy bags. You do the math . . . That's a one-week supply,' he said.

Charged: Robert Aaron Vineberg, pictured in court on February 5, has claimed he could have saved Philip Seymour Hoffman, who he said had a 10 bag-a-day heroin habit

NYPD sources told the Post the estimate - about twice that of an average junkie - was about right.

Vineberg was also a drug user and the pair battled with their addiction together, he said.

Vineberg managed to stay clean for a week at a time between relapses and said he and Hoffman would text back and forth, to keep one another on the straight and narrow.

But they fell out of touch late last year.

Vineberg was charged with felony drug possession and was one of three people dealers charged in connection with Hoffman's death. A young couple who lived nextdoor to Vineberg's Mott Street apartment, where cops seized some 300 bags of heroin, were charged with misdemeanor cocaine possession.

Wearing a gray prison jumpsuit, Vineberg told The Post he's 'a scapegoat' in the case.

His attorney insists there is no evidence to suggest Vineberg supplied Hoffman with the deadly narcotics and claims the pair 'were true friends who had bonded over and struggled with the dangerous use of narcotic drugs.'
