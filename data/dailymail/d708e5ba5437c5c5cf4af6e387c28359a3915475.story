A 49-year-old woman has been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a car ploughed into four people outside a kebab shop.

Two men and two children, 12 and 14, were injured during the incident in Redfield, Bristol, at around 6.40pm last night.

One of the men remains in Frenchay hospital with potentially 'life-changing' lower leg injuries while the other three are not thought to be serious.

Witnesses reported hearing a 'very loud bang' before the black Vauxhall Corsa smashed into Antalya Kebab on Marsh Lane. Â 

Three ambulances, paramedics in a rapid response vehicle, a hazardous area team and critical care team attended the casualties, and a fire engine was called to help make the building safe.

A resident, who asked not to be named, said the most seriously injured man lived on the street and had been shopping at an off license next door to the kebab shop.

He said: 'We heard a very loud bang. We rushed out of the house to see what had happened and saw a car just outside the kebab shop.

'The glass was smashed and it looked like the car had gone through the front window.'

'Two youngsters and an adult received treatment. A second adult remains in hospital with potential life-changing injuries.
