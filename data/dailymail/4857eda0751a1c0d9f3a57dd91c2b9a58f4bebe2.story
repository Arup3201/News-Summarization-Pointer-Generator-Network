Christian Benteke is close to ending his injury nightmare and could make a long-awaited return against Manchester City on Saturday.

Aston Villa have been without their talisman since March after the striker picked up a nasty achilles injury in training.

It meant Benteke - whose record stands at a goal every other game for Villa - also missed out on the World Cup with Belgium. The 23-year-old has been training with the first team for the past fortnight and manager Paul Lambert hopes to have him back imminently.

The news of Christian's Benteke's return to the Aston Villa squad will come as a huge boost to Paul Lambert

The Aston Villa boss will be delighted to call on the services of star striker Benteke imminently

‘Everyone in the team will be grateful when he is back and what he hands us is an attacking force,’ Lambert said after defeat at Chelsea. ‘I will see how he does this week. He’s been with the fitness lads for a few weeks. You have to remember he has been out for five months.’

Benteke is likely to play a behind-closed-doors friendly ahead of City’s visit to determine whether he’s able to make the bench.

Gabby Agbonlahor has led the line admirably in the star man’s absence, while Lambert believes Benteke could become one of the finest frontmen in world football.

‘He’s one of the best No 9s I’ve seen - even as a player. And I played with no slouches - three of the best strikers in the world at one time. He’s certainly up there and a lot younger than the lads I played with.’

Lambert name-dropped Henrik Larsson, who he was with at Celtic, as well as Karl-Heinz Reidle and Stephane Chapuisat - Dortmund’s front two during the Champions League final win against Juventus in 1997. Reidle scored twice that night in Munich.

‘They weren’t bad,’ Lambert laughed. ‘If Christian can have the career that those guys had he’ll be doing well for himself. He’s only 23 and has got a long way to go. He’s got a chance if he keeps at it.’
