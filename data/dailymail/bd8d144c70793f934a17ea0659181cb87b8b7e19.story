For the millions of commuters on the New York City subway with their eyes glued permanently to their smartphones they'll have something else to look at this month for a change.

An ad campaign launched earlier this month by the MTA features humorous signs displaying proper subway etiquette.

‘Clipping? Primping? Everyone wants to look their best, but it’s a subway car, not a restroom,' reads one of the signs which show an illustration of commuters using the subway car as their personal powder room.

Don't brush it off: Signs as part of a new MTA ad campaign break down subway etiquette for commuters

Not showtime: Signs instruct commuters NOT to do what these performing teens are doing in the subway car 

Another sign targeted performers on the subway who oftentimes use the poles in the car as their personal jungle gym, reports DNA Info.

'Poles Are For Your Safety. Not Your Latest Routine,' the ad reads.

'Hold the pole, not our attention. A subway car is no place for Showtime,' it continues. 

Another sign was aimed at subway passengers who sit with their legs widely spread open.

'Dude. Stop the spread, please,' said one of the signs which began popping up last Friday.

One sign had a message for the subway hoarder who likes to let their stuff sprawl out every which way.

The MTA has said that 2,600 subway cars will have the ads and they will create signs for the Long Island Railroad and Metro-North Railroad as well. 

Boundaries: This sign tells subway passengers to keep their stuff to themselves and not on top of others 

Say it don't spread it: The MTA has also taken on 'manspreading' in an effort to convince men to make room for more riders

Train not tray: Smelly, messy food is also the target of the MTA's new courtesy campaign
