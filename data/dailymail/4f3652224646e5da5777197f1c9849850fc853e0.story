Facebook and Twitter are simply the latest versions of social platforms invented by the Romans, according to a new book.

Its author claims that the internet has enabled the way people communicate with groups to return to its natural social state, as used by the Romans some 2,000 years ago.

In particular, journalist Tom Standage says that the way ancient graffiti was used to boast or complain about a variety of subjects was a key moment in the birth of social networking.

Mr Standage said modern users of social networks are the ‘unwitting heirs of a rich tradition with surprisingly deep historical roots,’ in his latest book.

In 'Writing on the Wall : Social Media – The First 2,000 Years', the Economist’s digital editor writes that it is as if the Romans and several historical figures including Thomas Paine and Martin Luther were on Facebook as they communicated in a similar style to the statuses users post today.

He justifies the idea by defining social media as 'an environment in which information was passed from one person to another along social connections in order to create a distributed discussion among a community'.

For centuries, people communicated in a similar, shared way before the arrival of mass media and the printing press began spreading news in a ‘one-way conversation', Mr Standage told Washington Monthly.

He believes it was similar to what we experience today when using social media and the internet,
 which has enabled anyone to become a publisher.

In the book, he traces the rise of social media throughout history and compares Facebook to large walls in the Forum, in Rome, where residents wrote messages about hotel reviews, political opinions and even their sexual conquests.

Sir John Harington, the inventor of the first toilet, who lived in the 16th Century, composed epigrams about life at the time which Mr Standage said bear some resemblance to the brief Tweets of today.

He cites Martin Luther’s act of pinning his 95 Theses on a church door as an example of a piece of writing going viral.

Mr Standage writes: Luther had unwittingly revealed the power of a decentralised, person-to-person media system whose participants took care of distribution, deciding collectively which messages to amplify through sharing, recommendation and copying.’

He also says that modern blogging culture is not dissimilar to the chaotic media environment of the 1640s, while ancient tablets with their flat writing surfaces and frames, look very much like modern tablet computers.

Mr Standage is an expert at drawing thought-provoking comparisons between modern technology and in the past has written books about the 'Victorian internet' and an 18th century chess-playing robot that inspired modern artificial intelligence research.
