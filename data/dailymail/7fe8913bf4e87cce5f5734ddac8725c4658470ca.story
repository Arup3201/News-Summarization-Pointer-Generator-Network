An Australian tourist in Rome has recreated the famous and romantic Trevi Fountain scene from 'La Dolce Vita' _ except it was far less elegant and the man was believed to be drunk.

Channeling Anita Ekberg in Federico Fellini's masterpiece, the unnamed and topless man plunges and swims into the most famous baroque fountain before getting arrested.

The video, posted on YouTube, captures the topless man putting one foot on the ledge before he slips and falls into the fountain. He then starts free-styling across as other tourists are seen filming the scene.

The man plunges into the fountain despite warnings to keep out the 18th century fountain.

Once he's completed his stunt, two cops are filmed running after him before eventually tackling him to the ground.

The man then gets back up and continues running before the second police officer successfully collars him and the pair start questioning him over his antics.

Police in Rome, tired of tourists using the historic fountain as a pool on hot days, are frequently handing out fines to tourists to prevent them from swimming.

The famous marble fountain was the location for the classic scene from Federico Fellini's 1960 comedy-drama, in which stars Sylvia and Marcello take a dip in the fountain after spending the evening strolling Rome's alleys.

The 282-year-old fountain was designed by Nicola Salvi, with construction started in 1732. It was completed in 1763.

The Trevi fountain is famous, not just for its Baroque extravagance, but the superstition that anyone who throws in a coin is assured of returning to Rome, and the usual method is with the right hand over the left shoulder.

An estimated $4000 is thrown into the fountain in Rome each day and the money is collected every night and given to subsidise a supermarket for Rome's needy.Â
