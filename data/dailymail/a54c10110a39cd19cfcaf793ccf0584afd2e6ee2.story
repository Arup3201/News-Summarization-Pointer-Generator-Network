Tesco triggered a tablet price war yesterday by unveiling its rival to the iPad.

The seven-inch Hudl will retail at £119 but will cost only £60 if bought through the supermarket’s loyalty points scheme.

It goes up against devices from Amazon, Google and Apple, whose iPad mini costs £269.

Tesco's 7-inch Hudl, pictured, has a quad-core processor, 16GB of built-in storage, 2MP front- and 3MP rear-facing cameras and costs just £60 when bought with Clubcard Points. It comes in four colours - black, blue, purple and red

Tesco insisted it had not cut corners to produce the budget tablet and claimed it would beat similarly priced competitors ‘hands down’.

The Hudl has 16GB of built-in memory – the same as the iPad mini and Google’s £80 Nexus 7 – and can access the internet and stream music and movies as well as on-demand TV service.

The device also features a ‘Tesco launcher’ button to access online grocery shopping and the supermarket chain’s other businesses including clothing, banking and mobile phone services.

**Currently £99 on offer

Tesco bosses said the Hudl was aimed 
at families who could not afford higher priced tablets or who felt 
intimidated by existing technology.

It has front and rear-facing cameras, 
allowing users to talk face to face via Skype, and will be available in 
four colours when it goes on sale next week.

Speaking at the launch event in London
yesterday, Tesco chief executive Phil Clarke said: ‘We feel the time is
right for Tesco to help widen tablet ownership and bring the fun, 
convenience and excitement of tablets to even more customers.’

Hudl owners will be able to buy apps, music and films from the Google Play store. In addition, owners will get special offers from Tesco-owned site, Blinkbox

The Hudl has the same basic storage options as its rivals but will only be available with dual-band Wi-Fi at launch, meaning it doesn't have the 3G or 4G options that the other tablets. Elsewhere, the Hudl has Bluetooth 4.0 and GPS, as well as a Micro HDMI port for connecting the tablet to a TV, for example, for video output

Tablets have proved hugely popular 
since the launch of the iPad three years ago and some forecasters have 
predicted they will overtake sales of traditional computers by the end 
of this year.

Three quarters of households still do not have one 
however.

Technology retailers have questioned 
whether cheaper alternatives can rival the popularity of the iPad. 
Sebastian James of Dixons said that, while there was a market for them, 
customers frequently expressed disappointment.

Speaking earlier this month, he said: 
‘We get a lot back because people use them and they say “No, what I 
wanted was an iPad” and they are not. There’s a reason why an iPad is 
more expensive, it’s just better.’

The Hudl is more costly than Amazon’s 
Kindle Fire, which is currently on sale for £99 but features less 
memory, a slower processor and no camera.
