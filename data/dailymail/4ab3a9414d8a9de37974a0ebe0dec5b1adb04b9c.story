Savers have missed out on £130billion of interest payments as a result of ultra-low rates – around £5,000 for every household in the UK – a report reveals today.

The Bank of England slashed interest rates to a historic low of 0.5 per cent in March 2009 at the height of the Great Recession.

Almost exactly six years on, figures lay bare the crippling impact low rates have had on prudent households, including many pensioners and hard-working families.

Laith Khalaf, a senior analyst at savings and investment firm Hargreaves Lansdown, which produced the report, said: ‘It’s been a gruelling six years for savers in the UK who have seen the income from their cash obliterated. The future doesn’t look too much rosier either.

‘While interest rate rises may be on the cards next year, when they come they are likely to be small and slow.’

Interest rates were 5 per cent in September 2008 – the month US investment banking giant Lehman Brothers collapsed.

But they were cut aggressively as the global financial crisis deepened, before reaching an all-time low of 0.5 per cent on March 5, 2009.

Had rates stayed at their September 2008 level, savers would have received £130billion more interest on their nest eggs, Hargreaves Lansdown found.

And according to Bank of England figures, the amount of cash held in accounts that pay no interest at all has risen from £47billion to £150billion since the financial crisis struck.

However, Mr Khalaf said that without ultra-low interest rates ‘we would almost certainly have been left in a much sorrier state by the financial crisis’.

He added: ‘There have also been beneficiaries of low interest rates, most notably borrowers, who have seen their mortgage payments fall substantially.’ Bank of England governor Mark Carney has admitted low rates ‘help debtors at the expense of savers’.

The Bank is expected to leave rates at 0.5 per cent again tomorrow, when the monetary policy committee finishes its latest monthly meeting.

Mr Carney has suggested that rates could even be cut again – possibly to 0.25 per cent or even closer to zero – if ultra-low inflation persists. But he and other senior Bank officials have also claimed the next move in interest rates will probably be up.

It is thought rates could start to rise late this year or early next year, although Mr Carney has insisted increases should be ‘limited and gradual’.

Dr Ros Altmann, a government advisor and pensions expert, said the over-65s have been offered ‘a bit of relief’ through so-called pensioner bonds. These offer 2.8 per cent on one-year bonds and 4 per cent over three years.

But she added: ‘Anyone younger than 65 is really struggling to make their savings pay.’
