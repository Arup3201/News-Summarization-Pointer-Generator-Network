Andy Murray hit the practice court at Melbourne Park on Tuesday as he prepared for his second-round match at the Australian Open.

Murray hit with Frenchman Richard Gasquet for around 90 minutes on the outside courts ahead of Wednesday's last-64 clash with Aussie Marinko Matosevic.

The British No 1 made a fine start to his campaign Down Under on Monday, beating Indian qualifier Yuki Bhambri in straight sets.

Murray trained on Court 17 under the watchful eyes of coach Amelie Mauresmo, trainer Matt Little and physio Mark Bender, as well as a crowd of around 250 spectators.

The Scot even received some advice from a compatriot amongst the crowd after he missed a volley which had clipped the net cord.

The spectator shouted in a loud Scottish accent, 'Come on Andy, keep your eye on the ball', to which Murray light-heartedly replied, 'When it hits the net, it's quite hard.'

Murray took time to chat with Gasquet's coach Sebastien Grosjean, the former world No 4 who he played at London's Queen's Club in 2008, albeit for only two games before the Frenchman retired due to injury.

He also received regular updates from Little on the first-round match between James Ward, who was his training partner during the off-season in Miami, and Fernando Verdasco which was taking place at the same time at the opposite end of the tournament site. Verdasco won in four sets. 

Murray and world No 81 Matosevic meet on Wednesday for the second time this year, with the former having won their encounter at the recent Hopman Cup event in Perth in straight sets.
