The king of character actors: Charles Durning pictured in 2008 when he was awarded a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame

Two-time Oscar nominee Charles Durning - dubbed the king of the character actors - has died aged 89.

The Tootsie star died yesterday of natural causes at his New York City home.

Durning is best known for role as a corrupt governor in 1982's The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas, which earned him an Academy Award nomination.

He was nominated a second time a year later for his performance as a bumbling Nazi official in Mel Brook's To Be Or Not To Be.

His longtime agent and friend, Judith Moss, announced today that he had died at his home in the borough of Manhattan.   

He is survived by his children, Michele, Douglas and Jeannine.

In 2008, Durning said he never wanted to stop working.

He said: 'They're going to carry me out, if I go.'

During his 50-year-career, Durning also won plaudits for his stage performances and received a Tony award in 1990 for his portrayal of Big Daddy in a Broadway revival of Cat On A Hot Tin Roof.

He was decorated in the Second World War but refused to speak of his experiences.

'Too many bad memories,' he told an interviewer in 1997. 'I don't want you to see me crying.'

He won
a Silver Star and three Purple Hearts during the Second World War and 
was among the first wave of US soldiers in the D Day Landings and was 
later taken prisoner.

Born in 1923, the O Brother Where Art Thou actor grew up in poverty in New York and lost five of his nine siblings to disease.

At school he was told he had no talent for art, languages or maths and should learn office skills.

But after seeing King Kong and some of James Cagney's films, he knew he wanted to perform.  

Durning began his career as an usher at a burlesque theatre in Buffalo, New York, when he replaced a comedian who was too drunk to go on stage.

He would recall years later that he was hooked as soon as he heard the audience laughing.

He started working on the stage and after years of minor roles, Durning gained national attention as a mayor in the Pulitzer and Tony-winning play That Championship Season in 1972.

Durning transferred to the big screen and gained fame as Dustin Hoffman's would-be suitor in Tootsie, the infamous seller of frog legs in The Muppet Movie and as Chief Brandon in Dick Tracy.

'I never turned down anything and never argued with any producer or director,' he said in 2008, when he received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.

Durning and his first wife had three children before divorcing in 1972. In 1974, he married his high school sweetheart, Mary Ann Amelio.

The family plan to have a private service and burial at Arlington National Cemetery.
