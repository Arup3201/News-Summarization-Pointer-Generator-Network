The sweltering British summer has led to an early apple harvest with fruit growers heralding one of the 'juiciest' crops on record.

As well as apples, strawberries, plums and wheat are all being harvested weeks earlier than in 2013, after basking in glorious sunshine for the past two months. 

But with predicted showers and the tail end of a hurricane on the way, farm hands are getting to work before the scorching summer becomes a distant memory. 

Heavy rain is expected across much of the country today, with downpours and thundery storms predicted in central and northern regions as the tail end of Hurricane Bertha hurls towards the south coast.

Farm hands pick Braeburn apples from  trees at Stocks Farm near Malvern in Worcestershire during one of the earliest fruit and crop harvests in living memory 

Hot temperatures over long periods of time improves the taste and crunchiness of the fruit say farm hands at Stocks Farm who promise a 'juicy and delicious' produce 

The soaring temperatures have brought the apple harvest forward by three weeks from last year with some varieties of the fruit already appearing on shop shelves 

Strawberries (Three weeks early) 

Apples (three weeks early) 

Plums and cherries( two weeks early) 

Rapeseed oil (four weeks early) 

Wheat (two weeks early)  

While shoppers will have to wait until September to see some popular varieties of the fruit on shelves, others are ripe for the picking and have already popped up in local shops across the country. 

The mild spring and warmer sunny weather has meant good news for all types of growers, with stone fruit like plums and cherries, and pears all doing well.

This summer was also the earliest oilseed rape harvest since the crop was first grown in the UK 30 years ago. Specialist grains such as Maris Otter Barley, used for real ale brewers, have also flourished. 

Adrian Barlow of English Apples and Pears said conditions had been kinder to apples than the last couple of years, which had been beset with poor weather, but it was too early to make comparison’s with 2011’s peak.

'Last year we had a very late crop, and we lost three to four weeks of varieties not being on the shelf at the supermarket so we lost that shelf space, and that made life difficult.

'But this year, all told, things are looking very promising for the coming season.

'Quality is extremely good, we’ve had a lot of sunny weather, meaning taste will be very good, and the texture and colour will be extremely good. 

English Apples and Pears said the high temperatures had been kinder to apples than in recent years but that it was too early to tell if this summer was better than the fruit's peak in 2011 

Braeburn apples at Stocks Farm in Suckley are being pulled from the trees in what is known as a 'late thinning' carried out to give other fruit a healthier chance of long-term growth

“As far as the shopper is concerned they’ll be very happy with the eating quality.

'The apples will have great crunchiness, lots of taste, and a good size.' 

Early varieties set to appear on shop shelves include Galmac, Delbar Estival, followed by Worcester Pearmain. 

Mr Barlow said chefs’ favourite the Bramley apple was also 'looking good', adding 'people will enjoy cooking with that variety this autumn'.

At Stocks Farm in Suckley near Malvern in Worcestershire, the Capper family grow 100 acres of apples some of which go to supply HP Bulmer and are also used in the manufacture of Magners cider. 

Alison Capper who runs the farm with husband Richard just a few miles from the rolling Malvern Hills, said: 'On the whole it’s looking like a really nice crop and it’s all down to the weather. 

The sun rises over  Quantock Hills in Bridgewater, Somerset, this morning after a humid night.  Temperatures are expected to drop next week across the country

Most of the country will see  showers today after a long stint of warm, dry weather with thundery storms expected later in the weekend as Hurricane Bertha approaches

'We've had lovely weather, we've had rain when we’ve wanted it,although some parts of the country have been drier than we’d have wanted.

'We've had some disease pressures which we always get with our climate, which might mean the skins aren't absolutely perfect in some cases. 

'But generally-speaking, the crunch is going to be juicy and delicious.'

While the good weather has brought about a record-breaking produce, sunny summer days will soon be a thing of the past with thrashing rain and thundery storms expected in some parts of the country this weekend. 

'Today there are yellow warnings for the southeast, the midlands, the north west and northern Ireland  for rain. We're looking at maybe 20-33ml within those areas with chances of heavy, sharp downpour and thunder and lightning because of the humidity,' said Nicky Maxey, a spokesman for the Met Office.   

'Tomorrow for most is better with areas of prolonged sunshine.'

Temperatures in London will reach the mid 20s while northern regions will remain in the high teens.

'It'll be a nice pleasant day but people need to keep an eye on the forecast for Sunday which is when the weather really moves in,' she added.

The storm could spread further north than previously expected with 50ml of rain predicted in some parts if it hits.

'It's still volatile at the moment, we're still watching and it may modify and change. It may miss us but it's very difficult to tell exactly where the storm might hit.'

Craig 
Woolhouse, Environment Agency Flood Risk Manager, said: 'Heavy rain on 
Sunday may lead to localised surface water flooding in some parts of 
England and Wales.

'On
 Sunday and Monday a combination of high spring tides and strong 
westerly winds bring a risk of large waves and spray and possible 
flooding to the south west coast of England and along the Severn 
Estuary.

'However, the forecast remains uncertain so we advise people to regularly check the flood risk situation over the next few days.

'If you're travelling to or from holiday then check your flood risk before setting off and don't drive through flood waters.'

Temperatures will lower next week with cooler nights and less humidity on the way.

'There's certainly a cooler feel next week, we're not returning to the high 20s that we've enjoyed so far.'
