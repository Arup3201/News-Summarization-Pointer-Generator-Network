President Obama was caught on a live microphone Monday telling a United Nations official that he hasn't smoked in six years because he's scared of his wife.

'I haven't had a cigarette in probably six years,' Obama was overhead telling Maina Kiai at the U.N. General Assembly in New York.

'That's because I'm scared of my wife,' he added with a grin.

When Kiai asks Obama whether he is still smoking, Obama responds, 'No, no, I haven't had a cigarette in probably six years. That's because I'm scared of my wife.'

President Obama grinned as he told Kiai that he is scared of his wife so he quit smoking

The conversation between Obama and Kiai began with the president asking about Kiai's smoking habit. 

'I hope you've quite smoking,' Obama says, according to a recording of the conversation aired by CNN. 

'Sometimes,' Kiai responds, before asking Obama whether he's kicked his habit.

The two men laughed as Obama assured he hadn't had a cigarette in six years thanks to the First Lady.

But Michelle Obama has given a different date for when Obama stopped smoking.

'It's been almost a year,' she told reporters February 2011.

Two years earlier, in 2009, Obama referred to himself as a 'former smoker,' but admitted he still struggled with the habit. 

'I've said before that as a former smoker I constantly struggle with it. Have I fallen off the wagon sometimes? Yes. Am I a daily smoker, a constant smoker? No,' he said at a press conference in 2009.

'I don't do it in front of my kids. I don't do it in front of my family. And, you know, I would say that I am 95 percent cured. But there are times where...There are times where I mess up.'

In photographs of the Obama couple, the body language makes it quite clear who is in charge.
