Ryan McGee, 19, was held by military police at his base in Germany after a nail bomb and bullets were found in his bedroom at the family home

A British soldier has been arrested on terrorism offences after a nail bomb and bullets were found in his bedroom at the family home.

Ryan McGee, 19, was held by military police at his base in  Germany after the discovery of the bomb and ammunition at his house in Salford.

Police also uncovered ‘inflammatory’ far-Right leaflets.

Army bomb disposal officers were called to remove the device and residents had to be evacuated to a nearby school.

Police also arrested McGee’s brother, Steven, 20, after images of child abuse were allegedly discovered on his computer.

Military police searching the soldier’s quarters in the barracks in Paderborn, Germany, uncovered an Army-issue thunder-flash smoke bomb normally used in training.

Rifleman McGee was flown to the UK where he was questioned at length about the nail bomb, ammunition and extremist literature.

It is understood he told detectives he knew nothing about the nail bomb. McGee was born in Oxford, but his parents Trevor, 52, and mother Vera, 55, moved to Patricroft in Eccles where he grew up.

The soldier, who is understood to have enlisted in 2010, serves with the 5th Battalion The Rifles, an armoured infantry regiment based at Alanbrooke Barracks in Paderborn.

The unit uses the Warrior fighting vehicle – one of the most potent  battlefield weapons in the infantry’s arsenal.

McGee would have had the opportunity 
to learn how to drive the  40-tonne Warrior, which has been used on 
operations including Iraq, Afghanistan and the Balkans.

Greater
 Manchester Police raided McGee’s house in a quiet suburban street in 
Eccles last Thursday after receiving information about online child 
abuse images.

While 
conducting a search of the property they found the nail bomb, ammunition
 and the extremist literature and seized a computer.

A source said: ‘The device – resembling a nail bomb – was obviously a significant find.

‘It
 is being examined by forensics to determine its readiness and whether 
it had an explosives or fuse incorporated into its design.

A counter terrorism investigation and a probe by the Royal Military Police is now taking place into the incident

‘Along with the device officers found quite a lot of extremist literature and right-wing pamphlets and leaflets at the house.’

Neighbours said they were ‘shocked’ about the discovery.

The arrest comes at a sensitive time for the Army, with two men on trial for the murder of Fusilier Lee Rigby, 25.

Tensions
 are running high, with members of far-Right groups taking to social 
media websites and chat rooms to discuss Fusilier Rigby’s shocking 
murder.

Last week Daniel 
Smith, 21, was jailed for 12 weeks for scrawling ‘EDL’ and ‘Lee Rigby’s 
killers should hang’ on the RAF Bomber Command War Memorial in London.

An
 Army spokesman said: ‘We can confirm that an individual has been 
arrested on charges linked to the  discovery of a suspicious device in 
Salford.’
