Chased: Gedling Borough Council spent £200,000 pursuing Trevor Evans for a £2000 council tax bill

A 'blinkered and aggressive' local authority spent £200,000 chasing a schizophrenic pensioner over an unpaid council tax bill after 'ignoring' the fact he was mentally ill.

Gedling Borough Council splashed out £50,000 in legal costs alone pursuing vulnerable Trevor Evans for a bankruptcy order over the unpaid bill of less than £2,000.

The Nottinghamshire local authority wrongly ignored the fact Mr Evans, 80, was schizophrenic and has dementia in chasing him over the payment, a judge ruled today.

The ruling means Gedling Borough 
Council now have to pay trustee fees of £70,000 and pay Mr Evans's legal
 costs, which solicitors estimate will amount to a further £80,000.

Those
 figures takes the total council spend to an astonishing £200,000 - more
 than a hundred times what Mr Evans owed in council tax.

A District Judge ruled the authority did not show compassion towards Mr Evans in pursuing the 'disproportionate' legal action.

District
 Judge Jane George said in her ruling that Alistair Townsend, the 
council's tax manager, had 'demonstrated a lack of understanding' when 
he said in a statement that there was 'no indication that Mr Evans was 
suffering from a mental illness' and he was 'under no duty to make 
detailed inquiries about Mr Evans' health'.

The judge added: 'The court is satisfied that it is more likely than not that when the bankruptcy order was made, Mr Evans was suffering from paranoid schizophrenia and vascular dementia and that by reason of those mental disorders he lacked capacity.

'The council could have shown compassion for him [Mr Evans] even if it did not accept the legal arguments advanced on his behalf.

'Purely on economic grounds it is not proportionate to have pursued Mr Evans for £1,909 and to have incurred what is likely to be in excess of £100,000 of costs and expenses.'

Legal representatives for Mr Evans had previously argued that Mr Evans's illness made it very difficult for him to deal with his own financial matters.

The pensioner, who lives in Bestwood Village in Gedling, Notts, was made bankrupt in 2004 after his debt problems mounted when he neglected to pay a council tax bill totalling £1,900.

Barrister Margaret Griffin, representing Mr Evans, said at a previous hearing that Gedling Borough Council showed a 'blinkered and aggressive' attitude in pursuing the debt and pushing for the bankruptcy order.

The council insists its insurance will cover the costs and the taxpayer will not be affected.

It does admit that its insurance premium has gone up, but says this is by a 'negligible' amount.

A council spokesman said: 'The council now accepts that Mr Evans lacked capacity at the time he was made bankrupt and apologises to him for any distress caused.

'At that time, the council was not aware of any issues surrounding Mr Evans's mental health, and if it had been made aware of these issues, it is unlikely that the action would have been pursued.'

The council says it has put in place measures to prevent known vulnerable people facing similar problems.

But a spokesman added: 'The council is concerned about the implications of the judgement, because it has no means to assess the mental health of debtors where it is not told that there is a problem.

'The council has been advised that there could be grounds for a positive appeal on this basis but has decided not to take this step because of the potential cost to the public purse and the further distress and uncertainty this may cause for Mr Evans.'

Matthew Hill, solicitor for Mr Evans, said: 'The council's decision to make Mr Evans bankrupt, for such a relatively small sum of money, and to carry on with this case for so many years demonstrates a worrying attitude towards vulnerable individuals.

'Mr Evans was lucky that help found him. However, I am sure that there are many other at-risk people who just slip through the net.

'This case should act as a stark warning to others, including other local authorities, who might seek to make people bankrupt.'
