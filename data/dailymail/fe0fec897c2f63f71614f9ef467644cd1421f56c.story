The beer made famous by Homer Simpson will be stripped from liquor store shevles across Australia because of its appeal to under-age drinkers.

Duff Beer will no longer be sold at Woolworths-owned liquor stores across the country, after a panel of advertisising experts deemed the packaging and marketing of the product had 'a strong appeal to children and adolescents'.

The Alcohol Beverages Advertising Code upheld complaints lodged by the Alcohol Policy Coalition - described as a 'coalition of Victorian based health and social agencies' - which had been advocating against its sale.

The ABCA agreed that the beer 'through its name and packaging has strongor evident appeal to children or adolescents' because of its cartoon-inspired origins.

The panel of three board members concluded that the Beer's packaging, colour scheme and layout had a close association with The Simpsons and for this reason would draw the 'immediate and close attention of under 18 year olds' who have grown up with the program.

'The basic point raised by the complaint is that by converting the fictional Duff beer of The Simpsons into a real product must mean that the product will have a strong or evident appeal to children,' the determination stated.

It stated that a big factor in breaching the code was the beer's direct association with the cartoon and the influence this has had on children over its lifetime.

'It is reasonable to say that if there was no Simpsons association, then simply having an alcohol product named ‘Duff’, and the packaging, colour scheme and layout used  could not of itself be said to have strong or evident appeal to underage persons.'

A Woolworths Liquor Group spokesperson said the $45 a carton sale of the beer would which began rolling out on shelves in May, will be discontinued.

She said remaining stock will still be sold. 'We respect the panel’s adjudication and will discontinue the stock,' she said.

The panel accepted in its decicion that the supplier (Woolworths Liquor Group) is committed to the standards of good alcohol beverage marketing contained in ABAC.

Ealirer this year the Australian Medical Association president Steve Hambleton said the new alcoholic beer would increase 'the social acceptability of alcohol misuse'.

'People have been watching The Simpsons for years, this is ready-made product placement and dangerous exposure to people misusing alcohol,' he said.

'We’ve talked in the past about the effects of exposing young children to alcohol advertising, here it is in spades.'

The Simpsons cartoon has been airing on Channel Ten for more than 20 years.

A pop-up bar dedicated to the beer's Australian landing is being held at Sydney's Woolloomooloo Bay Hotel for seven days and Duff also has its own Facebook page.

But the spokeswoman stressed to the Canberra Times that 'all materials have adhered to alcohol advertising codes'.

Dr Hambleton's comments come after repeated calls from the AMA to launch a parliamentary inquiry into alcohol advertising.

He said research showed underage drinking prevents young people from realising when they are drunk.

It has been quite a trial for Duff beer to even make it to Australian shores.

In the 1990s, brewers Lion Nathan were unsuccessful in trying to produce a version of the beer after the move was blocked by Twentieth Century Fox, who own the trademark to the brand, in the Federal Court in 1996.

Perth's Allstates Liquor Wholesalers were handed a 'cease and desist' by Fox in 2011 after stocking a beer called 'Legendary Duff Beer' with a remarkably similar label and logo to the one depicted in The Simpsons.
