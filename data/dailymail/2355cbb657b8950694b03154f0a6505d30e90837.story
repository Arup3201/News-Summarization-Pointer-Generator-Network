New York's largest hotel, the Hilton Midtown, will be discontinuing room service from August.

Crain's reports that hungry or thirsty guests will instead have to head down to the lobby where a self-service cafeteria called Herb n’ Kitchen opened this month.

A spokesperson for the 50-year-old establishment, which charges an average of more than $200 a night, said the move reflects the changing 'needs, wants and lifestyle' of customers.

Growing trend: New York's largest hotel, the Hilton Midtown, will be discontinuing room service from August

In 2012, room service represented just 
1.2per cent of total hotel revenue, down from 1.3per cent the previous year, according a survey conducted by PKF Hospitality Research.

Analysts suggest that high prices are to blame for the trend.

At the Hilton Midtown, located on
 6th Avenue between West 53rd and 54th street, a plate of three 
scrambled eggs for breakfast is listed at $22.50 while a Cobb Salad 
costs $24.75.

In small print, the menu also states that for each order there is an additional 15per cent service charge and an in-room dining fee of $5.50 per person. 

Henry Harteveldt, a travel industry 
analyst, explained to NBC
 that in cities where 24-hour dining and take-out services are available, room service has become obsolete.

He said that a lobby cafe at the Hilton would help it to 'win back some of the business it may be losing to outside 
establishments.'

Some also see the end of the labor-intensive amenity as a way for the 2,000-room venue to save money and more than 50 members of staff are expected to lose their jobs.

But Mr Harteveldt warned that the move could also put the hotel’s status in danger.

'There are so many hotels to choose 
from. If everyone is offering room service, I don’t know why I would pay
 the same rate with no service'

'It will be tough for the Hilton to 
call itself "full service" without room service, even though it offers 
many other amenities,' he said.

'If room service is a requirement to 
earn a four star rating from independent organizations like AAA, 
Hilton's move may put [that] rating in jeopardy, unless the hotel can 
obtain an exemption.'

For many regulars the news has come as a blow. Michael Henry, 78, an author and publisher, told The New York Times that he likes to have coffee waiting when he steps out of the shower in the morning.

'I think it’s dehumanizing the service. It’s what I call catering to the lowest common denominator,' he complained.

While Maria-Chiara Della Valle, 29, an engineer from London, said she counted on room service when she arrived late at night and was jet-lagged and would not be returning to the Hilton if it was no longer on offer.

'There are so many hotels to choose from. If everyone is offering room service, I don’t know why I would pay the same rate with no service,' she explained.
