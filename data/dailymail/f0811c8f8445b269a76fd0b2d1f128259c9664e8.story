They are being billed as '45 of the finest apartments and penthouses ever built in Essex'.

A developer is about to put a block of luxury apartments in the seaside town of Westcliff-on-Sea on the market for upwards of £1million.

A glossy brochure describes the Nirvana development as the 'ultimate living' and pictures idyllic vistas, as well as floor-to-ceiling glass walls with 180 degree views of the sea.

The only snag is that developers Dedman 
Gray are locked in a dispute with nearby residents over access to the 
underground car park.

A statement in the publicity brochure
 reads: 'With Nirvana we wanted to create a landmark development with an
 unprecedented level of quality, luxury and privileges never before seen
 in this area.

'Our idea 
was to create a lifestyle most people only dream about, with one of a 
kind apartments, ultimate finishes, details and layouts.

'All located in a perfect setting with amazing sea views.'

Mike
 Gray, managing director of Dedman Gray, told the Southend Echo his 
company has a long waiting list of people keen to look around the new 
development of 45 two and three-bedroom apartments and penthouse suites 
which come with access to a basement gym, outdoor pool and 53-space car 
park.

Much of the interest 
has come from wealthy people wanting to use the apartments as a holiday 
home during the summer months, he said.

Mr
 Gray added: 'I think there has been an increasing demand along the 
seafront generally and a lot of people are interested in this type of 
accommodation.

'We are 
seeing for the first time a lot of people spending half of the year 
abroad and the other half over here. With these sort of apartments they 
can just lock them up and go away.

'You get much nicer views from flats on higher floors as opposed to houses.'

The luxury apartments in the seaside town of Westcliff-on-Sea will sell for upwards of £1million

Developers are hoping the seafront apartments will prove popular with wealthy people wanting to use them as a holiday home in the summer months

The apartments on Chalkwell Esplanade are about to go on the 
market after developers finally managed to overcome 
economic difficulties and iron out planning problems despite permission first being approved in 2006.

Lawyers acting for the owner of the Nirvana development Mukesh Aggarwal insisted the car park dispute is not a problem.

Owners of the the 100-yard strip of land are adamant there is no agreement 
allowing residents at the nine-storey development to cross it 
so they can reach the concealed parking area.

They have appointed a legal team alleging Nirvana's developers do not have permission to cross their so-called ransom strip.

Neighbouring residents of the Nirvana development are taking legal action which could prevent owners accessing the underground car park

Ransom strips, commonly used between 
developments, are lodged with the Land Registry and prevent any 
extension or encroachment by a neighbouring property.

But Mr Aggarwal's solicitor Heather Millane said: 'We have received a letter, but there is no merit whatsoever in this claim and we will be defending any action brought. We just think it has been done for nuisance value.

'They do own the strip of land, but we have not trespassed on it. Surveys we have had carried out are quite clear about that.

'We don't cross that strip of land and even if we did we have got the right of way.'
