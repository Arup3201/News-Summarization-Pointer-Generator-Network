These incredible pictures show wild bottlenose dolphins flipping and diving in the air and frolicking in the sea off the coast of Inverness in Scotland.

They look like they’re delighted to be in British waters as they nudge and compete with each other in a playful display of animal gymnastics. 

And, they have got plenty to 
celebrate. This year, more Bottlenose dolphins have been spotted in 
British waters than at any other time since the mid-1990s.

Twenty individuals including seven 
youngsters were seen in one day by conservation officers from the Whale 
and Dolphin Conservation Society (WDCS) at the Kessock Channel near 
Inverness. Usually, only six would be seen on a summer’s day in the 
area.

Photographer and WDCS officer , Charlie Phillips, explained why dolphins put on dramatic aerial performances.

He said: ‘The dolphins are engaging in energetic behaviour. They do this as part of socialising and it can take many forms.’

‘In these pictures we see a young 
dolphin that is back flipping over the top of two adults. Youngsters 
often do this to get attention or just sheer play.’

Bottlenose dolphins are one of the 
most northerly living members of the dolphin family and there are 
thought to be about 200 living in the North Sea at any one time.

Marine scientists believe population numbers are stable or perhaps on the rise.

Mr Phillips believes that the increase in numbers could be due to the explosion in fish numbers in recent weeks.

He said: ‘The earlier part of the season was poor for dolphin sightings because of a bad run of salmon.’

‘But both the salmon and mackerel numbers have increased rapidly in the last week or so.

‘This has a knock on effect with the amount of dolphins that we see.

‘If the dolphins feed well during the 
summer and sustain this, then this will have the females in great 
condition for giving birth.

'It will also mean that the dolphins will have a bigger fat reserve to carry into the leaner, winter months.’
