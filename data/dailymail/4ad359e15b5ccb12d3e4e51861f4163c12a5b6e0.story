A couple whose £1,000 holiday was ruined by the noise of building works claim they have been offered just £30 in travel vouchers in compensation. 

Jordan Pedelty and Dee Kimmings, from Slaithwaite, West Yorkshire, say they were woken at 7am every morning by drilling and banging at the Columbus Aparthotel, Playa de las Americas, Tenerife.

When booking the week-long holiday with Thomson, the couple say they were not warned about any building works taking place at the resort during their break.

Jordan Pedelty and Dee Kimmings feel they have not been compensated for their holiday nightmare

Mr Pedelty snapped the builders in action at the Columbus Aparthotel, Playa de las Americas

Having being disturbed by the noise on the first day, they requested to move rooms, only to be told this was not possible as all other rooms were fully booked.

Speaking to MailOnline Travel, Jordan, who works for Yorkshire Water, said: 'There was banging and drilling, it was just a nightmare.  If you've had a night out you don't want to be woken at 7am.

'We couldn't even go to the pool because it was too noisy.

Mr Pedelty's anger only grew when he found other holidaymakers had received a discount due to the work

Other guests at the Columbus Aparthotel were warned in advance of the building works

'What made it worse was when we were chatting to other holidaymakers, they all said they were told about the building work and had got a reduced price because of it.

'That just made us feel even worse.' 

After contacting Thomson to complain about the noise that disrupted their stay, Mr Pedelty claims they were originally offered £30 in holiday vouchers. 

A gesture from the Thomson shop in the Kingsgate Centre in Huddersfield topped this up to £130 in total.

Around 30-40 rooms at the Columbus Aparthotel were being worked on, according to Mr Pedelty

The couple, however, have said they are seeking a full refund for their holiday. 

Mr Pedelty estimates that 30-40 rooms were being renovated during their trip - and he took photographs of the work being carried out and also took footage which captures the noise.

'I'm still not happy with what has been offered,'  Mr Pedelty said.

'It was an absolute nightmare from the start; from the first day my partner just wanted to go home. 

'We definitely think we are entitled to a full refund, or a nice gesture would be for Thomson to take me, my partner and her child away to compensate.' 

Jordan  and Dee claim they were not warned of building work going on at Columbus Aparthotel

A spokesperson for Thomson told MailOnline Travel: 'Thomson is sorry to hear that Mr Pedelty was unhappy with his holiday accommodation in Tenerife.

'Unfortunately, due to a system error, notification of the building work was not sent to Mr Pedelty prior to departure. 

'However, every effort was made to position him in a room as far away from any disruption as possible. We are in contact with Mr Pedelty directly to resolve his complaint.

'We would like to reassure customers that this hotel remains a popular choice with guests.'
