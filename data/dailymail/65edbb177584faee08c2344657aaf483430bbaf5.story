It's a nervy moment for any first time father - leaving the hospital for the first time cradling your newborn son ready to take him home and begin the daunting task of caring for him.

But for Prince William, the first moments of fatherhood had the added pressure of making sure he held the baby properly and fixed the child in its car seat in front of the lenses of the world's media.

Despite being watched by millions of people worldwide, Prince William appeared to have passed his first test as a father with flying colours.

The 31-year-old looked surprisingly relaxed as he left the Lindo Wing and cradled his son while talking to the waiting press.

Prince William spoke to the press while cradling his son carefully

He was seen moments later carrying 
the child to a waiting car in his car seat before fixing his son safely 
inside at the first attempt and even driving the vehicle away himself as the young family 
returned to their home in the grounds of Kensington Palace this evening.

The second in line to the throne 
looked to breathe a sigh of relief as he climbed into the driver's seat 
ready to leave the Paddington hospital where the Duchess of Cambridge 
gave birth just yesterday afternoon.

Both the Prince and his wife looked in good spirits as they beamed in front of the cameras as they introduced their son for the first time.

As they left St Mary's carefully cradling their precious child, the Duke of Cambridge followed in the footsteps his parents Charles and Diana took with him 31 years ago, when he was born there on June 21, 1982.

He told reporters: 'He's a big boy, quite heavy. We're still working on a name.

'Well he has a good pair of lungs on him, that's for sure.'

He confirmed that the baby kept the 
couple waiting and was overdue, adding that he will remind the child of 
that when he's older.

Ever the gentleman, with a huge smile 
the prince added: ‘He’s got her looks thankfully’ to which the Duchess 
responded ‘No, no, no I’m not sure about that.’

The Duke, Duchess and Baby Cambridge will travel home to Kensington Palace tonight, spending two weeks there while William is on paternity leave.
