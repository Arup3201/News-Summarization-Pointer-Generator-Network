Charged: Daniel Dobson (pictured), who is accused of a betting scam at the Australian Open, is the son of Detective Inspector Tim Dobson, a member of the Met police team reviewing the Maddie McCann case

The British tourist at the centre of an alleged tennis betting scam is the son of a senior Met Police murder detective investigating the disappearance of Madeleine McCann, it emerged today.

Daniel Dobson, 22, has been charged with illegal gambling by allegedly sending information about play at the Australian Open to an international betting ring, using a device sewn into his shorts.

His father is Detective Inspector Tim Dobson, a member of the Metropolitan Policeâ€™s 'Gold Group' dealing with the cold case review of missing Madeleine.

Daniel Dobson, currently being held in Melbourne, is one of six men accused of helping gambling associates beat the time TV time lag.

He is set to fly back to Britain on Monday, after paying his bail bond and agreeing to return to Australia later this year for further court dates.

Dobson, of New Malden in south-west London,  was arrested after a match where he allegedly used a device to wirelessly send points information to an international betting agency before the action reached TV screens.

Dobson was said to have used the advantage of the 10-second delay between action and live TV to send the data and affect the betting odds.

Melbourne Magistrates Court was told that Dobson had 
allegedly had the device built into his shorts and linked to his mobile 
phone.

Police are searching 
for two other Britons in relation to the alleged offence, known as 
'courtsiding', following Dobson's appearance in court earlier this month.

At
 a previous hearing, police prosecutor Josh Diemar told the court: 'He 
sent the agency the results before they could get them through the 
official channels.

'That data has been sent quicker than the official results can get posted, and had the ability to affect betting odds.'

The Met Police team reviewing Madeleine's disappearance believe she may have been abducted during a bungled burglary after conducting a review of the case.

Earlier this month, the Daily Mail 
exclusively revealed that Scotland Yard had identified three local 
burglars as 'prime suspects' after an extensive trawl through mobile 
phone records.

They are now mounting pressure on their Portuguese counterparts to give them access to the suspects.

Madeleine,
 who was then nearly four, disappeared from her family's holiday 
apartment in Praia da Luz in the Algarve on May 3 2007 as her parents 
dined at a nearby restaurant with friends.

It is now known that between January and May 2007 there had been a four-fold increase in the number of burglaries in the area.

Police
 said in October that in the 17 days before she disappeared there was 
one burglary and one attempted burglary in the block where the McCann 
family were staying.
