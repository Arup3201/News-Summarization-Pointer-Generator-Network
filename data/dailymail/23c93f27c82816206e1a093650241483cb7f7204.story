Looking at these pictures of Harvey the kitten, you’d think he was distinctly uncomfortable.

But this is actually the best way for the four-month-old rescue cat to get around – and he’s perfectly happy with it.

He was born with bones missing from his front legs, but that has been no handicap for the youngster, who has instead learned to walk on his ‘elbows’ and even move along on his back legs.

Floppy feline: Four month old rescue kitten Harvey was born with bones missing from his two front legs

Resourceful: Harvey's foster carer says the kitten's rare condition doesn't slow it down

Harvey, who has a rare condition 
called radial agenesis, was spotted when his owner put him up for sale 
on the online advertising site Gumtree.

An X-ray revealed that Harvey’s ulna and radius bones, which connect the upper half of his front legs to his paws, were missing.

He is now waiting for an operation to replace the bones with metal pins thanks to the efforts of animal charity Cats Protection.

In the meantime he is enjoying 
life at the home of his ‘foster carer’ Liz McCulloch, 50, who said: 
‘He’s a lovely little thing.

‘Because Harvey was born that way he 
doesn’t know there’s anything wrong with him so he runs around on his 
elbows and happily plays with my other cat and dog.

‘He’s OK at the moment but if he doesn’t get the operation he’ll start to damage his spine when he gets bigger.’

A well-wisher acquired Harvey from Gumtree in November and handed him in at a Cats Protection branch in Glasgow.

Workers, who thought he had simply 
been born with dislocated legs, took him to a vet, where the X-ray 
revealed he had radial agenesis, which occurs when an animal’s leg bones
 fail to develop.

The condition can be corrected by 
implanting metal pins between the paw and upper bone, but an operation 
can be carried out only on cats over six months old to give the existing
 bones time to harden and take the weight of the pins.

Cats Protection has raised more than 
£3,000 in only three days so Harvey can have the life-changing operation
 when he is six months old.

Rare condition: Only four cats have been born with radial agenesis in Scotland in the past 30 years

Lorraine Currie, co-ordinator of Cats
 Protection’s Glasgow branch, said: ‘A friend of the branch spotted him 
on Gumtree. It said in the advert he had two broken legs but when she 
got there he had no bones at all. She felt sorry for him and took him 
home but it became clear he needed a lot of treatment and that’s when we
 got involved.

‘Once Harvey has had the operation, his future looks very bright.’

A spokesman for Gumtree, which lets 
sellers post adverts for free,  said: ‘We have a very strict policy 
regarding the sale of sick or injured animals on the website.

‘We apologise that someone was able 
to post an advert for Harvey despite him having medical problems and we 
will do our best to make sure similar incidents do not occur in the 
future.’
