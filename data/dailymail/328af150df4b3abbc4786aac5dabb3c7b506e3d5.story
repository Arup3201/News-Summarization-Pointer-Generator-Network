As head of Strictly Come Dancing’s panel, Len Goodman is a rigorous judge of posture and technique.

But the ballroom dancer admitted he has not always been so focused, smoking cannabis as a teenager in the 1960s.

The 70-year-old also confessed, at the start of each series of Strictly, he is at a loss as to who some of the contestants are.

Len Goodman told US chat show host Jimmy Kimmel that he used to smoke cannabis, but grew out of it

He told US chat show host Jimmy Kimmel: ‘Listen, I grew up in the Sixties, when I was a teenager, so I know all about wacky backy.’

Talking about actor Tommy Chong, a pro-marijuana campaigner and contestant on Dancing With The Stars – the US version of Strictly which Mr Goodman also judges – he added: ‘I grew out of it as I got older. Tommy still likes a spliff but good luck to him.’ 

The dance expert said he has often never heard of the celebrities who appear on the programmes.

‘It is not a problem as you get to know them as the shows go along,’ he said.

‘You know that I live in England so we don’t get General Hospital or whatever your shows are called. 

'It’s the same in Britain … I look at the list and I think, “Who the hell he is he?” But what I love is that they always get an interesting cast.’

Mr Goodman also spoke about his childhood, telling Mr Kimmel: ‘My sayings come from my granddad … The roughest part of London is the East End, Bethnal Green. That is where we were brought up with an outside toilet.’
