Suspect: Police in Pakistan consider Muzaffar Hussain the chief suspect in the double killing

The father of a woman gunned  down with her Scottish businessman husband was last night named as the chief suspect in what is thought to have been an ‘honour killing’.

Glasgow-based Saif Rehman, 31, and Uzma Naurin, 30, from New York, were shot dead on a trip to Pakistan, when their car was ambushed in the north-eastern city of Gujrat.

Police in the country say Miss Naurin’s taxi driver father, 58-year-old Muzaffar Hussain, is being viewed as a chief suspect in the shootings.

Mr Hussain, from New Jersey, was in Pakistan at the time of the killing but has now returned to his U.S. home.

In an exclusive interview, he told 
the Scottish Daily Mail: ‘I had no idea this might happen; everything 
seemed fine. If it turns out this was an honour killing, it would be 
horrific.’

The
 Mail reported yesterday that a group of four gunmen stopped the car 
carrying Mr Rehman and his wife on November 1 before killing them.

Tragic: The couple were  murdered in Pakistan during an ambush on their taxi

The couple had been about to start a new life together in the U.S. after their trip to Pakistan for Mr Rehman’s brother’s wedding.

They were married in Manchester three 
years ago but another, fuller ceremony involving both sides of the 
family took place in Glasgow in June.

The
 driver of the car in which Mr Rehman and his wife were travelling was 
uninjured in the attack and is said to have been an associate of Mr 
Hussain’s. Named only as ‘Adeel’, he was last night in police custody.

The couple were accompanied in the car by Mr Rehman’s sister and her two-year-old daughter, who were also unharmed.

Detectives in Pakistan are probing claims
 that the couple’s marriage had caused upset among some members of Miss
 Naurin’s family. Police sources in Gujrat last night said they had been
 told she had been married previously to another man in England.

Committed: The couple had been in a long-distance relationship, but had made it work

A friend of hers in Scotland last night said the marriage had been ‘approved’ by her family – but her first husband, who has not yet been identified, is said to have killed himself.

She was later told to marry the dead man’s brother in another arranged match but refused to do so as he was too young.

Last night, Pakistani police spokesman Nasir Butt said the deaths were being treated as an honour killing and Mr Hussain was chief suspect.

He said: ‘Muzaffar Hussain came to Pakistan soon after he was informed that Mr Rehman and Uzma had arrived from Scotland to attend the wedding of Mr Rehman’s brother, Qari Shakir. Mr Hussain was also invited to this wedding.

‘Afterwards, he went back to his family home – where he is originally from – near Gujrat.

‘In the meantime, after staying for a day, he called his daughter Uzma and told her that he was not feeling well and was going to hospital.

‘Uzma rushed to the hospital along with her husband and started taking care of her father, who complained of severe chest pain.’

While in hospital, Mr Hussain is said to have asked his driver – ‘Adeel’ – to take her daughter and son-in-law to Gujrat for a shopping trip. At around 5.30pm, Adeel received a call on his mobile phone, he stopped the car and got out – then moments later the gunmen pounced.  

Police investigating the killings later found Mr Hussain was no longer in hospital. Officers say he drove to the port city of Karachi in a rental car and boarded a flight for the U.S.

Mr Hussain, who lives in a £250,000 house in Jersey City, New Jersey, with his wife Munir Begun, 55, insisted he did not know who had killed their daughter and her husband.

He said: ‘I can’t get over it. I had no idea this might happen. Everything seemed fine. She was looking to start a family with Saif and have children together. Now they’re gone. All we can do is pray.’

In Gujrat, Mohammad Zakir, Mr Rehman’s father, said: ‘My son was a respectable person. He lived in Glasgow for over six years with grace and honour. We are waiting for the final result of the police investigation.’

A friend of Miss Naurin’s, who asked not to be named, said:  ‘In September, the visa application for Saif came through and he was going to join her and live in New York.

‘They were basically looking forward to starting their new life together. For it to end like this is just awful.’
