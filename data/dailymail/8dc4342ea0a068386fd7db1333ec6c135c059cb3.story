A few hours after Marcus Arceneaux was pictured carrying his bloodied niece Bethany to safety yesterday, the young woman's family have revealed how they tracked down and took on her kidnapper in a deadly confrontation.

Two days after the 29-year-old mother was abducted by her ex-boyfriend Scott Thomas, her family found her being held hostage in an abandoned Louisiana house.

In the violent confrontation that followed, Miss Arceneaux was stabbed by Thomas who was then apparently shot dead as her rescuers took justice into their own hands.

'We kicked doors down. It was like a movie unfolding,' Miss Arceneaux's brother, Ryan, told the Advertiser. 'If we would have waited, she would have been dead.'

Ryan was part of a search party made up of family and friends who were helping police try to find Miss Arceneaux after Thomas, the father of her two-year-old son, grabbed her on Wednesday evening.

At around noon on Friday the group were investigating an abandoned house, barely visible through the sugar cane fields surrounding it.

The house, on Anderson Road, was close to where Thomas had ditched his car on Wednesday night.

Marcus Arceneaux, who helped rescue his niece, told KLFY 10: 'Everyone came running from the building and when I ran that way I saw my son was coming with Bethany. He had discovered her and got her out of that house.'

Kaylyn Alfred, another of the victim's brothers, said they heard screams for help as they entered the desolate building.

As the search party confronted Thomas, who was the subject of a restraining order, he allegedly began to harm Miss Arceneaux.

In the tussle that followed Thomas was shot and Marcus Arceneaux was able to grab his niece and carry her to safety.

'She’s shook up, she’s sliced up, but she’s alright, Ryan said. His sister was believed to have been stabbed but is recovering in hospital and has been reunited with her son.

Captain Kip Justice of the Lafayette Parish Police Department confirmed that 29-year-old Thomas died as a result of injuries received in the confrontation.

Captain Judice said the family were 
acting in defense of Miss Arceneaux and it is unclear at this time if 
charges will be brought against anyone in her family.

In June Bethany Arceneaux filed a protection order against Scott Thomas, after he locked her inside their home and made threats to harm her.

Thomas was barred from coming near his ex-girlfriend or son, and was ordered to stay away from her home and his child's daycare center.

In the order she claimed Thomas had choked her, dragged her by her hair and 'held a knife to my throat countless times'.

During the final episode before she left him she said he made threats to kill her. 

She
 added: 'Since then Scott has been riding around my mom's house and my 
work looking for me. I am afraid for me and my son's life.'

Thomas abducted Miss Arceneaux as she collected her son from daycare on Wednesday, November 6.

'The
 man began harming her. He [Arceneaux’s family member] did what he 
needed to do to stop that aggressive behavior from Mr Thomas,' Captain 
Judice said.

Police, who 
were also searching for the victim and were close by when shots were 
fired, are now trying to piece together what happened.

The
 search for Miss Arceneaux began when witnesses saw Thomas bundle her 
into a car at 5.20pm on Wednesday as she collected their son from a 
daycare center.

The
 29-year-old was seen forcing his victim into a Buick LeSabre before 
driving off with her, leaving the victim's child abandoned in her car.

Miss Arceneaux had filed a protection order earlier this year against Thomas, claiming he had locked her and their young son in the family home and threatened to kill her.

The protection order had barred Thomas from coming close to his ex-girlfriend's home or son's daycare center after the threatening episode.

'After we called cops on him he grabbed our son from me and shoved him into the car,' Miss Arceneaux wrote on the order.

'He then got on his knees in front of the cops and said "I swear to God on all my children I will kill you.'

She added: 'Since then Scott has been riding around my mom's house and my work looking for me. I am afraid for me and my son's life.'

Hostage: Scott Thomas grabbed Bethany Arceneaux, the mother of his child, on Wednesday evening

The
 getaway car was found later that day in Anderson Road, Duson, but it 
wasn't until Friday that Miss Arceneaux was rescued from an abandoned 
house on the same street.

Lafayette
 Police Corporal 
Paul 
Mouton told MailOnline that after her rescue a swat team entered the 
house, and found the 'suspect was deceased' at about 3pm (CST) on 
Friday.

Captain Judice said the victim's family found her after hearing her screams.

'Family members are walking through a pasture with an abandoned home ... and heard a yell from inside the home,' he said.

Relatives first told KATC TV-3 that gunfire was 
exchanged between the family and the alleged kidnapper.

Mr
 Arceneaux, the victim's uncle, said: 'We found my niece Bethany, she's 
OK. I'd like to thank everybody who came out and helped us search.'

'Friends and family actually came 
into contact with the victim and the suspect in or out of the house,' Corporal Mouton told KPEL.

'There was a confrontation at that point. During that 
confrontation, the victim was freed,' he said, adding that Miss Arceneaux was said to be in 'good condition other than some injuries that she had received'.

The couple have a violent history revealed in several police reports, according to KATC 3. She had filed several reports alleging domestic abuse and also filed a restraining order against Thomas.
