Bikers opposing a Muslim rally took over Washington DC Wednesday morning.

Thousands of motorcyclists roared into the nation’s capital for the Two Million Bikers rally - as the nation observed moments of silence to honor the victims of the 9/11 terror attacks - intent on drowning out an event originally titled the Million Muslim March.

The Million Muslim March changed its name to the Million American March Against Fear (MAMF), but that did not change the bikers’ minds.

Denied a police escort, the group took more than an hour to move through Washington DC

Starting from a Harley Davidson store just outside the city at 11am, groups of 50 motorcycles made their way into the capital, according to the Washington Times.

Denied the necessary permits to have a police escort through traffic and stopping for traffic lights, the massive assembly took just over an hour to move out. Aerial footage showed bikers choking traffic on both highways and local roads.

The bikes rolled through the city for 50 minutes for heading to the Beltway.

Riders told the Washington Times they believed the denial was for political reasons.

‘We’re here for 9-11,’ national ride coordinator Belinda Bee told the paper. ‘We are going to have a peaceful ride... but there are people who are sick and tired of their rights and liberties being taken away.’

With no definitive route, the groups spun around the city, flying their flags and calling out tributes

The event was designed to drown out another titled the Million Muslim March. Although this was later changed to Million American March Against Fear (MAMF), the bikers were undeterred

Authorities denied the accusations, noting that permits are not needed to rally in the capital.

‘This is a God event,’ a commenter said on the motorcycle rally’s Facebook page.

‘I believe America has been in a 12-year funeral. But I’m a Christian man and not a Muslim. I believe in the resurrection! God bless America!’ The commenter added.

MAMF, the rally opposed by the bikers, began on the National Mall just after 12pm – right as the bikers began to circle the area.

With many streets surrounding the rally closed off to traffic, the bikers were not able to get to the rally of their disdain.

‘A historic event for solidarity of humanity to establish peace, harmony and justice,’ is how MAMF’s Facebook page described their rally, organized by the American Muslim Political Action Committee (AMPAC).

The rally, which started outside of the city, took over some of the main entrance points to Washington DC

The riders did make their presence felt though, with clusters of motorcycles circling the surrounding blocks like hawks as MAMF’s speakers and organizers tried to rally.

Explaining that American-Muslims ‘stand with America against terrorism,’ speaker Ruby Sous said ‘we want to stand here in solidarity with the American people against hate and violence,’ according to the Times.

Christian protestors who showed up to protest against the Muslim rally – in addition to the motorcycled masses – shouted back ‘you picked the wrong day!’

Throughout all this, motorcycles could be heard circling, coursing and revving their way around the rally. 

Another speaker, Princeton University professor Cornel West preached social justice and peace, while condemning violence, said the Times.

Attendees tried to hold a moment of 
silence, but all they heard were revving motorcycles, MAMF chief 
organizer Isa Hodge told the Times.

Though not quite as large as the name would suggest, there were several thousand motorcyclists in attendance, stretching at least one-third of a mile long as they rumbled down suburban highways, according to reports.

MAMF also did not exactly live up to its name, with only a few dozen supporters showing up, according to the Times.

Several speakers also railed against conspiracy theories, American soldiers in the Middle East and other ‘fringe topics,’ according to the Times.

They were outnumbered by the throngs of park police and counter-demonstrators on hand, according to reports.

A number of motorcyclists were involved in an accident on the ride into the capital, but no severe injuries were reported.

The bikers’ Facebook page thank everyone for coming, wished everyone a safe ride home and said they’ll see each other next year.

MAMF’s website was down when MailOnline tried to access it, and its Facebook page offered no indication the rally would happen again.

The phone number listed on AMPAC’s website went directly to a Sprint voice mailbox that was full.
