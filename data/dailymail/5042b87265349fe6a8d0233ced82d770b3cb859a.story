Hasbro says it will soon reveal a gender-neutral Easy-Bake Oven after meeting with a New Jersey girl who started a campaign calling on the toy maker to make one that appeals to all kids.

McKenna Pope,13, of Garfield, New Jersey, got more than 40,000 signatures on her online petition at Change.org and the support of celebrity chefs including Bobby Flay, who backed her call for Hasbro to make a gender-neutral oven and to include boys in the ads.

She was prompted to start the petition after shopping for an Easy-Bake as a Christmas present for her four-year-old brother, Gavyn Boscio, and finding them only in purple and pink.

Too girly: McKenna started the petition when she went to buy an Easy-Bake Oven for her four-year-old-brother, but discovered it comes only in purple and pink

Hasbro invited McKenna and her family
to its Pawtucket, Rhode Island, headquarters to meet with its Easy-Bake
team today.

During the meeting, Hasbro executives showed off a prototype of their newest Easy-Bake: one that's black, silver and blue.

Hasbro has been working on the new 
color scheme and design for about 18 months, and decided to invite 
McKenna to see it and offer her thoughts, said John Frascotti, Hasbro's 
chief marketing officer.

McKenna said the company is doing everything she asked, including putting boys in the ads.

'I think that they really met most or
even all of what I wanted them to do, and they really amazed me,' she 
said, adding that Gavyn thought the new design was 'awesome.'

Frascotti pointed out that the 
classic toy has had about a dozen different color schemes, from yellow 
to green to teal to silver, since first being introduced in 1963. The 
most recent iteration, introduced in 2011, is mostly purple with pink 
accents.

Leading the charge: Chef Bobby Flay said last week he agreed that Hasbro should make an oven in other colors to appeal to boys

He said it's sold well since then, 
and that prompted the company to look for a way to update it and to 
broaden the consumer base by doing it in different colors.

'It's actually a product that's 
played with by both boys and girls,' he said. 'We will continue to offer
the existing product too because it's so popular.'

Hasbro plans to introduce the new 
color scheme at the industry's Toy Fair in New York in February. 
Frascotti said people are likely to see it on store shelves next summer.

As for McKenna's Christmas present 
for her brother, she said the TV show Inside Edition gave the family an 
Easy-Bake Oven after learning of her campaign. For Christmas, she said, 
she'll probably buy him some mixes to bake in it.

McKenna was prompted to start an online.after she wanted to buy an Easy-Bake Oven for her four-year-old brother, Gavyn Boscio,and found them only in purple and pink.

The petition quickly amassed more than 40,000 signatures and top
chefs including Manuel Trevino of TV's Top Chef and Michael Lomonaco of
Porterhouse New York applauded McKenna's cause in a video posted via YouTube.

Lomonaco is known for his TV appearances and was executive chef at 
Windows on the World atop the north tower of the World Trade Center at 
the time of the September 11 terrorist attacks. In the video, he and other 
chefs root for McKenna.

'We signed your petition McKenna! You get Hasbro to change that 
packaging! Little boys and little girls can all be chefs,' he says to 
cheers from the rest of his kitchen.

Laurent Tourondel, who has started restaurants around the world, says 
cooking is for girls AND boys, while New York chef Spencer Rubin asks: 
'Hasbro, please make an Easy-Bake for dudes.'

Joshua Whigham, of The Bazaar by Jose Andres in Los Angeles, says he supports making an Easy-Bake that's more friendly for boys.

'I can understand not wanting to cook on a pink oven,' he says.

'Ask 
Hasbro for a steel, or a black or a something really cool oven.'

Brad Spence of Amis Trattoria in Philadelphia says he has young children at home.

'My son, I cook with him every Sunday, so I'd love to see something like that happen,' he says.
