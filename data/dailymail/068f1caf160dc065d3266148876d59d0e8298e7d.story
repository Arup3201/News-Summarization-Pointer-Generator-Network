Mountain bikers and cross-country runners are at risk from the deadly stomach bug E.coli  if they get splashed with mud, doctors warned today.

Medics at Aberdeen Royal Infirmary say they treated a 23-year-old cyclist for an E.coli 0157 infection after he was admitted to the hospital suffering from vomiting, abdominal pain and bloody diarrhoea.

The man - a vegetarian - said he had not eaten undercooked meat or vegetables, nor had he spent time with livestock or visiting farms before falling ill.

But eight days before his symptoms began the man had competed in a cycling event along wet, muddy tracks in eastern Scotland.

He, along with other competitors, had removed the mudguards from his bicycle to reduce weight, and mud and water had splashed on his face during the race. 

It is thought this was how he became infected with the bug, which can be found in animal faeces and farm slurry.

The man said he had taken part in a 'Tough Mudder' event, which involves a 10 -12 mile race with obstacles such as climbing vertical walls and plunging through ice pools.

The cyclist, who has not been identified, recovered - but the doctors have highlighted his case in the Journal of Infection Prevention.

Writing in the research paper, the doctors warned: 'Sporting endeavours such as cycling and cross-country running events often take participants through such high-risk areas and may be an important cause of contact with E. coli 0157.

'This case highlights such exposure and should alert clinicians to the possibility of E.coli 0157 infection and the importance of individuals presenting with bloody diarrhoea with a history of participation in similar sporting or other events.'

Escherichia coli, often known as E. coli, are bacteria found in the digestive systems of many animals, including humans. 

Most strains are harmless but some can cause serious illness.

Most cases of E. coli food poisoning occur after eating undercooked beef (particularly mince, burgers and meatballs) or drinking unpasteurised milk.

The incubation period for food poisoning caused by E. coli is usually 3-4 days, but it's possible for symptoms to take longer to appear (up to two weeks).

Dr Robert Laing, consultant physician in Infectious Diseases and Internal Medicine at Aberdeen Royal Infirmary and co-author of the journal article, said: 'We know that E.coli 0157 survives well in cattle faeces.

'This case highlights the possible risk to participants in sports that expose them to mud that may have been contaminated by animal faeces.

'Splashes to the face are likely to be particularly hazardous and efforts should be made to protect yourself from these as far as possible.'

E.coli 0157, which lives in the gut of animals, is usually associated with food poisoning or drinking contaminated water.

Scotland has a particularly high incidence of the strain, with more than twice as many cases than other parts of the UK. 

In 2012, three people contracted E.coli 0157 infection following a 12-mile 'Tough Mudder' event at Drumlanrig Castle, Dumfriesshire, which involved immersion or contact with mud.

Also in 2012, a study of one of the world's largest mountain bike races, the 95k Birkebeinerrittet in Norway, which annually attracts 19,000 participants, found that when mudguards were attached to bikes, there were fewer cases of gastrointestinal illness.  

Health Protection Scotland warned anyone taking part in outdoor sports such as running or cycling and  crossing areas that might contain animal faeces are at risk of picking up E.Coli (pictured in a petri dish)

A Health Protection Scotland spokesman said today: 'Anyone taking part in outdoor sports such as running or cycling - and events that cross areas that have recently been occupied by animals such as cattle or sheep - should be aware of the risks of picking up a gastro-intestinal infection such as Vero cytotoxin-producing Escherichia coli (VTEC), more commonly referred to as E.coli.

'One of the main risks to humans is from coming into contact directly or indirectly with contaminated animal faeces. 

'Our advice would be to follow common sense principles and if you have contaminated hands or face, take care that this material does not get into your mouth and wash as soon as possible and before eating.'
