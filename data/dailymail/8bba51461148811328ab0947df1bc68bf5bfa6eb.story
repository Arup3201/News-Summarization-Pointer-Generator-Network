At least four people have died after a flash flood swept revellers at a village festival in Italy into a river.

A furious torrent carried off cars, kiosks and villagers, who were celebrating the traditional 'Feast Of The Omens' in Molinetto della Croda, near Venice.

Around 200 people had taken shelter under a tent when 'an avalanche of water' struck, leaving more than 20 people injured, four badly, authorities said.

Survivors described a five-foot wall of water carrying away everything in its path.

Heavy rains swelled waterways, causing the river to overflow at the hamlet, popular with tourists for its ancient windmill.

Head of Civil Protection in the Treviso area, Mirco Lorenzon, said it was 'a surreal and terrifying scene'.

'A sea of mud engulfed everything. Many were saved only because they clung to tree trunks and branches to avoid being dragged away.

'Nobody had ever seen anything like it. There was two metres of water.'

'There was an hour-and-a-half of rain so heavy that you couldn't see anything,' added Luca Zaia, governor of the Veneto region, during a visit to the site of the disaster on Sunday.

'Within the hour, I will sign papers declaring a state of emergency for the area,' Zaia said in a television interview.

Deadly floods and mudslides are not uncommon in Italy. Last November storms in Sardinia caused floods that killed 18 people.

Central Europe is bearing the brunt of a wet and thundery summer that is submerging towns and emptying beaches.

This week flooding has turned deadly in several European countries.

Two people died in Romania when the Gilior river burst its banks, and thousands have been evacuated from their homes after tornadoes in the Balkans.

Rescue teams evacuated over 500 people overnight from the small Bulgarian town of Mizia after torrential rains caused flooding that claimed at least one casualty, an interior ministry official said on Sunday.

Rescue teams with boats and helicopters were still evacuating stranded people on Sunday. One man was found dead in his flooded home, said Nikola Nikolov, head of the ministry's fire safety and civil protection unit.

Over 50 houses have collapsed after the Skut River, which runs through the town, burst itsbanks. Hundreds of houses remain under water. Another town and several villages in the northwestern area, which is close to the Danube, were also hit by floods.

'It was terrible, terrible. The water kept coming and coming. My home is under water. Luckily I have an aunt who lives in the higher parts of the town. I think we will be at least 30 people in that house tonight,' Valia Mircheva, a farmer from Mizia, told BTV television.
