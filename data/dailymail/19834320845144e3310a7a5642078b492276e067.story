A boy with a shaking voice made the first distress call from a sinking South Korean ferry, three minutes after the vessel made its final turn, it has been revealed.

The boy was put through to the fire service after calling the emergency 119 number, before being forwarded to the coastguard two minutes later.

His call was followed by about 20 others from children on board the ship, a fire service officer has told Reuters.

The Sewol ferry sank last Wednesday on a routine trip south from the port of Incheon to the traditional honeymoon island of Jeju.

Of the 476 passengers and crew on board, 339 were children and teachers on a high school outing. Only 174 people have been rescued and the remainder are all presumed to have drowned.

The boy who made the first call, with the family name of Choi, is among the missing. His voice was shaking and sounded urgent, a fire officer told MBC TV. It took a while to identify the ship as the Sewol.

'Save us! We're on a ship and I think it's sinking,' Yonhap news agency quoted him as saying.

The fire service official asked him to switch the phone to the captain, and the boy replied: 'Do you mean teacher?'

The pronunciation of the words for 'captain' and 'teacher' is similar in Korean.

The captain of the ship, Lee Joon-seok, 69, and other crew members have been arrested on negligence charges. Lee was also charged with undertaking an 'excessive change of course without slowing down'.

Several crew members, including the captain, left the ferry as it was sinking, witnesses have said, after passengers were told to stay in their cabins.

President Park Geun-hye said on Monday that instruction was tantamount to an 'act of murder'.

A 22-year-old female crew member however has been hailed a hero after she stayed behind to help students off the boat.

Park Jee-Young handed out life jackets to students on the boat in a bid to help them escape while the ferry was sinking, even though she wasn't wearing a life vest, South Korean media reported.

Witnesses told Yonhap news agency that she told students that crew members must stay on the ship until everyone else leaves, and that she would follow them after helping passengers.

Her body was one of the first to be recovered after the ferry sank and now lies in a funeral home in the city of Incheon.

Floral tributes left at the memorial room contained messages including 'We will always remembers your sacrifice' and 'Hero', it has been reported.

An aunt of the 22-year-old, who did not want to give her name, told CNN: 'This is so unfair that our Jee Young had to die while the captain ran away.

'Jee Young was so responsible, and the captain just ran away.'

Park is reported to have left college to work for the ferry company in order to support her family following the death of her father two years ago.

Other members of the crew are also reported to have given their lifejackets to passengers as the ferry sank.

Others worked from rescue boats to break windows with hammers and pull people trapped in cabins to safety.

At least seven of the 29 crew members are missing or dead, and several of those who survived stayed on or near the ship to help passengers, Associated Press has reported.

Four crew members appeared in court on Tuesday and were briefly questioned by reporters before being taken back into custody.

One unidentified second mate said they had tried to reach the lifeboats, but were unable to because of the tilt.

Only two of the vessel's 46 lifeboats were deployed.

Two first mates, one second mate and the chief engineer stood with their heads lowered and it was impossible to tell who was speaking.

One said there had been a mistake as the boat made a turn. Another said there was an eventual order to abandon ship. He said the crew gathered on the bridge and tried to restore balance, but could not.

'Maybe the steering gear was broken,' one said.

Media said the ship lost power for 36 seconds, which could have been a factor.

Public broadcaster KBS, quoting transcripts of the conversation between the crew and sea traffic control, the Jindo Vessel Traffic Services Centre, said the passengers were told repeatedly to stay put.

For half an hour, the crew on the third deck kept asking the bridge by walkie-talkie whether or not they should make the order to abandon ship, KBS said.

No one answered.

'At the time, we could not confirm what the situation was on the bridge,' KBS quoted a crew member as saying.

'We kept trying to find out but ... since there was no instruction coming from the bridge, the crew on the third floor followed the instructions on the manual and kept making "stay where you are" announcements. At least three times.'

Lee was not on the bridge when the ship turned. Navigation was in the hands of a 26-year old third mate who was in charge for the first time on that part of the journey, according to crew members.

In a confused exchange between the sinking Sewol and maritime traffic control released by the government, the crew said the ship was listing to port.

'Make passengers wear life jackets and get ready in case you need to abandon ship,' traffic control said.

The Sewol answered: 'It's difficult for the passengers to move now.'
