Americans are notoriously incompetent when it comes to locating foreign countries on a map - even those where the world's superpower is waging war.

But it seems the deficiency cuts both ways, with many foreigners unable to identify where the 50 states of the union can be located, research has found.

When asked to click their mouse on where they thought a state was located, most foreigners were only able to recognise New York, California, Florida and Texas, with most of the rest a mere blur.

Many foreigners are unable to identify the 50 states of the union, particularly mid-West states like Wyoming

Real-estate listings site Movoto used an online game to ask 400 people from outside the U.S. to hover their cursor over each state as its name popped up.

While the four states which appear most in Hollywood films and exported U.S. television programmes were well recognised, and many knew at least whether a state was in New England, when it came to the rest of the western, mid-western and southern states, results were abysmal.

'Colorado, Wyoming and Utah were all frequently confused with one another, while the placement of Ohio stretched from Indiana all the way to Kansas,' said Chris Kolmar, Movoto's 'chief armchair economist'.

'Kansas itself was often placed in Utah, or even Arkansas. And almost nobody was able to locate Georgia correctly.'

He said that most respondents, whether or not they were right, seemed confident in their choice 'even when they were placing Virginia somewhere around Nebraska, or relocating Pennsylvania to South Carolina.'

The results will be pleasing for Americans, who have been globally mocked for their lack of knowledge of the world beyond U.S. borders.

A poll of about 500 young Americans aged between 18 and 24 conducted for National Geographic in 2006 found that 6 per cent were unable to even locate their own country on a map of the world.

It also found that only just more than a third were able to locate Iraq on a map of the Middle East, despite the U.S. staging a full-scale occupation of the country at the time.

A study published in the European Journal Communication in 2009 which compared knowledge of international affairs among Britons, Danes, Finns and Americans found U.S. citizens came consistently last.

Just 58 per cent of Americans knew who the Taliban were, compared to three quarters of Britons. However it did find that Americans were most likely to be able to identify Nouri al-Maliki as the prime minister of Iraq, with three in ten answering correctly, compared to just more than one in five of Britons.

More recently, a Newsweek experiment which set 1,000 Americans the challenge of completing their country's citizenship test found 29 per cent could not name the current vice president and almost three quarters did not know what the Cold War was about.

In 2003 a U.S. Strategic Task Force of Education abroad report warned that Americans' ignorance of world affairs was so bad it amounted to a threat to national security.

Mr Kolmar concluded his report on foreigners' knowledge of the 50 states by saying: 'Whether at home or abroad, it seems like just about everyone could stand to brush up on their geography.'

However, some have more work to do than others.
