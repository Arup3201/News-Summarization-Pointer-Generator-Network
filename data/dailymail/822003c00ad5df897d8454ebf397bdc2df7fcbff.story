A top cricket coach has been jailed for six years for abusing young boys.

Michael Strange was a respected scout for Durham County Cricket Club, tasked to seek out and train talented young players.

He was also employed as a club captain and coach at Bill Quay Cricket Club in Gateshead.

Michael Strange was jailed for six years and the court said he had been leading a 'double life' while being 'admired and respected' for his cricket career

Newcastle Crown Court heard the 52-year-old, who was regarded as an expert by many, used his position as a trusted mentor to subject three boys to sickening sex attacks.

He was convicted of seven charges of indecent assault and one of indecency with a child after a trial, during which his victims had to re-live their experiences in court, earlier this year.

Judge Roger Thorn said Strange had been leading a 'double life' while being 'admired and respected' for his cricket career.

He gave Strange a lifelong sexual offences prevention order which bans him from attending cricket matches involving male youths.

Strange must sign the sex offenders register for life and will be banned from working with children for life.

The judge said: 'The jury clearly found that you had lied and lied and lied.'

The court heard Strange, of Wardley, Gateshead, had been well liked and respected by those who knew him and continues to deny any wrongdoing.

Prosecutor Julian Smith told the court: 'He was a mentor and guide to all three complainants and he was a man with some influence and would have been seen as important by these young men.

'With each complainant Strange befriended them, complimenting then on their cricketing prowess.

The judge at Newcastle Crown Court said: 'The jury clearly found that you had lied and lied and lied.'

'He would, when they were alone, show them pornography and would give them alcohol.

'He would get them on their own, either in his car after offering them a lift

home, or stopping at his own home as he was taking them home. Once they were on their own he would sexually assault them.'

The court heard the three victims were aged around 12 and 13 when they were abused by Strange in the 1990s.

A spokesman for the Bill Quay Cricket Club said: 'Our sympathy goes out to the victims.'
