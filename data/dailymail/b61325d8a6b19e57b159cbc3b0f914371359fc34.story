The outer shell of a building on Manhattan's West Side that was under demolition has partially collapsed Wednesday afternoon, injuring a construction worker and raining debris on a school bus below. 

Fire department spokesman Brian Norton says the worker rode down the collapse by standing on scaffolding or part of the three-story midtown Manhattan building as it crumbled.

'He actually was on the third floor, and when the floors pancaked down and collapsed, he rode the three stories down and walked out of the building. He was very lucky,' Fire Chief Dan Donoghue told reporters at the scene.

Dangerous job: Construction crews were using heavy equipment to bring down the three-story brick building at 57th Street near 11th Avenue when the materials between the second and third floors collapsed

Raining debris: Rubble from the building damaged a yellow school bus parked on the street

Norton says the worker has been hospitalized with non-life-threatening injuries. He says all other workers are accounted for.  

Rude awaking: School bus driver Daniel Campbell was awaiting the return of elementary school students from Ridgewood, New Jersey, when falling debris fell on the roof of the bus 

About 16 construction workers were using heavy equipment to bring down the three-story brick building at 57th Street near 11th Avenue when the materials between the second and third floors collapsed just before 2.40pm, City Councilwoman Helen Rosenthal told reporters at the scene.

Workers say the collapse sounded like an explosion. 

Scaffolding around the construction site also collapsed and the refuse cascaded onto the roof of a parked school bus, smashing its windshield.

That jolted awake driver Daniel Campbell, who was napping inside the otherwise empty bus while awaiting the return of elementary school students  from Ridgewood, New Jersey, who were having lunch at Hard Rock Cafe in Times Square, reported the New York Daily News. 

'It was like a nightmare,' Campbell said. 'It was a whole bunch of things that fell.'

Demolition permits were properly obtained by the construction company, Councilwoman Rosenthal said.

Inspectors from the city's Department of Buildings were checking the safety of the site so that firefighters may conduct searches for anyone who may have been trapped.

Lucky to be alive: The injured construction worker rode down the collapse by standing on scaffolding or part of the three-story

The school bus was parked outside the three-story building while a group of elementary students were having lunch at Hard Rock Cafe in Times Square 

The startled driver of the school bus likened the building collapse to a nightmare  

A half dozen firefighters were being lifted by cherry-picker trucks and were using power tools to saw through the collapsed scaffolding.

The building, which was reportedly built in 1920, has been closed since September 30, 2014.  

The collapse happened a day after a construction worker at the Barclays Center in Brooklyn was crushed to death when several steel beams fell on him.
