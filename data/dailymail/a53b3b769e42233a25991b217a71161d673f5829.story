Police learned the nonagenarian had been alone inside the truck for a number of hours after her son left her in the parking garage and disappeared inside just before 2pm.

The woman is confined to a wheelchair and is unable to care for herself, police told WBAL.

The only food or drink that appeared to be in the car was an empty can of soda. The air temperature in the vehicle was 81F and only one window was partially cracked open.

The lady was initially incoherent when spoken to by police officers but eventually was able to help them locate her son.

The woman was given water and found not to be in medical distress after being examined by emergency services.

Police managed to have the elderly woman's son pick up his cellphone at 7.15pm. He was arrested when he came back to his car ten minutes later. 

The Department of Social Services has been contacted.
