'we also plan to raise a memorial in the memory of the dead children inside the school.' arsal khan khichi is accused of paying. a cook, mohammad rafiq, 50,000 rupees ($500) to poison food at his. rival's home on june 9, dogar said. nearly 50 people became sick and. were taken to the hospital, and 22 died. jehanzeb khan khichi was not at. home when the incident occurred, dogar said. rafiq has confessed to poisoning the. food, dogar said. police waited to arrest him until they received. medical reports that confirmed the dead had been poisoned. arsal khan. khichi is still on the run, and a murder case has been registered. against him as well, dogar said. it comes as it was claimed the. headmistress of the school is on the run, as police. claim she forced a reluctant cook to serve up the food. authorities say the cook had warned. meena devi, head of the rural school in the eastern state of bihar, that. the cooking oil may have been contaminated. she had complained that the oil looked strange and gave off a foil smell when heated, but her concerns were dismissed. grief: women mourn the death of their children who died after consuming the contaminated meals. family members of a school girl (not pictured) mourn her death: twenty-three youngsters died after eating the food, and dozens more remain in hospital after suffering sever poisoning. 'the headmistress said \"continue cooking and serve the food to the children\",' said police superintendent sujeet kumar. it is thought that many of the children who ate the meal may have been saved had the headmistress tasted the food before it was served, as required under the rules of the midday meal scheme. children are said to be far more vulnerable to this type of poisoning than adults as they have low body weight. soon. after the potato curry and rice was served at the school in rural. chappra, bihar, one of india's poorest states, pupils started. complaining of stomach cramps, then began to vomit and collapse. ninety. minutes later, the first victim, named as four-and-a-half year old anshu kumar, died on the way to hospital. death came. so quickly for some that they died in their parents' arms while being. taken to hospital. dozens of other children are being treated for food poisoning. authorities. discovered a container of pesticide in the school's cooking area next. to the vegetable oil and mustard oil, but it wasn't yet known if that. container was the source, said amarjeet sinha, a top official in bihar. villagers stand next to mass graves of the schoolchildren who died: authorities discovered a container of pesticide in the school's cooking area next to the vegetable oil and mustard oil. a villager walks past the graves: more answers are expected on friday, when a forensic laboratory is to issue the results of its tests on the dead children, the food and the uncooked grain stored by the teacher in her house. the clothes and shoes of a victim, placed by her family members on her grave: post-mortem reports on the children who died have confirmed that insecticide was either in the food or cooking oil. abandoned: a villager looks back towards the locked house of the headmistress of a school, who fled with her family after children started dying. the cooks said that the teacher controlled the food for the free daily lunch. 'it's. not a case of food poisoning. it's a case of poison in food in a large. quantity, going by the instant deaths,' mr sinha said. more answers are expected. when a forensic laboratory issues the results of its tests on the. dead children, the food and the uncooked grain stored by the. headmistress in her house, he said. police were searching for the principal, who fled after the students started falling sick, sinha said. local farmer ajay kumar's 5-year-old daughter was among the victims. he was in his house, which is about 100 metres from the school, when he heard screams from neighbours saying the children had fallen ill. 'i rushed there and all the kids were on their backs or clutching their stomachs or vomiting. i picked up my girl and took her to the local hospital right away,' ajay said. parents hitched rides or took public transport to get to the hospital, which is about nine miles from the village, he said. medical staff told them they had no medicines to give them. his daughter died shortly afterwards, writhing in pain on the floor. when reuters visited the village, there were at least 18 burial mounds, many in a large field opposite the school. some contained multiple bodies and villagers could not agree on how many children were buried in them. many parents said they buried their children's toys and clothes in the graves. the. cooks, manju devi and pano devi, told the associated press that the. principal controlled the food for the free daily lunch provided by the. government at the school. she. gave them rice, potatoes, soy and other ingredients needed to prepare. the meal for tuesday lunchtime and then went about her business. as the. children ate, they started fainting, the cooks said. the two cooks were not spared either. manju devi, 30, ate some of the food and fainted. her three children, ages five, eight and 13, fell ill as well. all were in stable condition thursday. while pano devi, 35, didn't eat the tainted food, her three children did. two of them died and the third, a four-year-old daughter, was in the hospital. 'i will stop cooking at the school,' she said. 'i am so horrified that i wouldn't grieve more if my only surviving child died.' mr sinha said one of the cooks told authorities that the cooking oil appeared different than usual, but the principal told her to use it anyway. doctors treating the children said they suspected the food had been contaminated with insecticide. media reports said the cooking oil may have been stored in an old pesticide container, but there was no independent confirmation of this. 'the minute the children were brought in, we smelled this foul odour of organophosphorus,' said dr. vinod mishra, a doctor in the medical team treating many of the children at patna medical college hospital in bihar's capital, patna. organophosphorus compounds are used as pesticides, which are widely available and are sold under a variety of different brands. dozens sick: schoolchildren receive treatment at a hospital after falling ill soon after eating free school meals. treatment: the meal was cooked in the school kitchen, but school authorities stopped serving it as children started vomiting. the free midday meal was served to the. children in gandamal village in masrakh block, 50 miles north. of patna, the bihar state capital. those. who survived the poison were unlikely to suffer from any serious after. effects from the tainted food, said patna medical college hospital. superintendent amarkant jha amar. 'there. will be no remnant effects on them. the effects of poisoning will be. washed after a certain period of time from the tissues,' mr amar said. he. said that the post-mortem reports on the children who died confirmed. that insecticide was either in the food or cooking oil. he said. authorities were waiting for lab results for more details on the. chemicals. horror: a father mourns as he holds his dead daughter today inside an ambulance, outside a hospital in patna, in the eastern indian state of bihar. location: it was not immediately clear how chemicals ended up in the food in a school in masrakh, near patna in bihar, although one official said the food may not have been properly washed before it was cooked. the mid-day. meal plan is one of the world's biggest school nutrition programs. state. governments have the freedom to decide on menus and timings of the. meals, depending on local conditions and availability of food rations. it. was first introduced in the sixties in southern india, where it was. seen as an incentive for poor parents to send their children to school. since. then, the program has spread across the country, covering some. 120million schoolchildren. it's part of an effort to address concerns. about malnutrition, which the government says nearly half of all indian. children suffer from. although. there have been complaints about the quality of the food served and the. lack of hygiene, the incident in bihar appeared to be unprecedented for. the massive food program.\n",
