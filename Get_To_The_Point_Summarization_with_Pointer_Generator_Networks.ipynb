            "new york (cnn) -- the u.s. population is expected to top out at close to 312.8 million people just around the time crowds gather to watch the ball drop on new year's eve, according to new census data released thursday. the figure represents a 0.7% increase from last year, adding 2,250,129 people to the u.s. population since the start of 2011, and a 1.3% increase since census day, april 1, 2010. the agency estimates that beginning in january, one american will be born every eight seconds and one will die every 12 seconds. u.s.-bound immigrants are also expected to add one person every 46 seconds. that combination of births, deaths and migration is expected to add a single person to the u.s. population every 17 seconds, the census bureau said. meanwhile, millions are set to ring in the new year. in new york, authorities are preparing for large crowds in manhattan's times square, where lady gaga is expected to join mayor michael bloomberg to push the button that drops the waterford crystal ball at 11:59 p.m. et on new year's eve. \"and i'm so looking forward to performing on nye+dropping the ball with mayor bloomberg!\" the pop star posted on twitter. \"what an honor as a new yorker.\" past guests have included muhammad ali, rudy giuliani, colin powell and bill and hillary clinton. on thursday, officials conducted new york's annual \"airworthiness test\" -- a process in which confetti is tossed by handfuls above times square -- in preparation for the annual city tradition of dumping one ton of confetti over revelers in the iconic square. the big apple this year edged out las vegas for the first time in seven years as the top travel u.s. destination for those celebrating the new year, according to a december travel booking website poll. seven new york neighborhoods made the top 10 list, with two districts in las vegas and one in new orleans making up the other three, according to the priceline poll. \"it appears that new york city will be helped this year by a weather forecast that calls for warmer than usual temperatures over the holiday weekend,\" said company spokesman brian ek.\n",

            "(cnn) -- barack obama touched hearts during an impassioned speech to a 200,000-strong crowd in berlin, german newspapers agreed, but suspicions remain about the white house contender's motives for courting a european audience. barack obama addressed a huge and friendly crowd in berlin on thursday. berlin's der tagesspiegel wondered whether so many young people had ever gathered for a political event in germany and said that obama's address -- which echoed speeches by former u.s. presidents john f. kennedy and ronald reagan when the divided city was in the cold war frontline -- could only have been made in the german capital. \"barack obama's address might not have been statesmanlike and it definitely wasn't worldly-wise. but with its symbolism and the message of this 46-year-old, it certainly was the signal of a new era for a new generation on both sides of the atlantic,\" the newspaper said. \"what better thing could have happened to us than the potential next president of the u.s. sending this message to the world from here?\" obama moved on from germany to france on friday where he was due to hold talks with president nicolas sarkozy. he is also slated to meet british prime minister gordon brown and opposition leader david cameron in london later friday. german tabloid bild said obama had articulated his version of the american dream -- the idea that politics can change the world: \"unlike george w. bush, he wants to do this in cooperation with others, especially europe. that's his message from berlin: let's try this together!\" but bild warned that an obama presidency would place fresh demands on traditional allies such as germany, which fell out with washington over the war in iraq and has refused to contribute combat troops to nato operations in afghanistan. ireport.com: view photos from the scene. \"he didn't say what he expects, but it's not hard to figure it out. he'll call for more german participation during international crises; he'll call for more german soldiers,\" said bild. but it concluded: \"no matter how you might feel about this: a president obama would be germany's friend -- and a fan of berlin!\" munich's sueddeutsche zeitung sounded a more cautious note, warning that an obama presidency would be \"expensive for germany.\" \"he explicitly called for german soldiers for afghanistan -- he did not say 'more soldiers' but that was what he meant,\" said commentator reymer kluever. \"and obama also indicated this: he will want support as president to wind up the iraq adventure.\" the paper noted too that the speech had been intended less for the crowds gathered in berlin's tiergarten park than for \"hesitant white voters in ohio and pennsylvania, colorado and virginia\" and said that obama had proved himself to be a clever tactician, capable of shifting positions to suit his audience. \"he wants to convince (voters) that the world will also listen to a black president... and there's one other thing one shouldn't forget when talking about obama: he easily reworks even positions that have been written in stone and adjusts to new requirements.\" but nobody in the german press appears to have been quite as smitten by their visitor as bild reporter judith bonesky, who had the opportunity to work out with obama in the gym of the ritz carlton hotel earlier in the day. \"obama (with toned arms and a strong back) puts on his headphones for his ipod to listen to pop music. he hums quietly. then he jumps on a fitness bike. he pushes three times on the pedals -- but then can't be bothered with it. \"he picks up a pair of 16 kilo weights and starts curling them with his left and right arms, 30 repetitions on each side. then, amazingly, he picks up the 32 kilo weights! very slowly he lifts them, first 10 curls with his right, then 10 with his left. quickly i ask: \"mr. obama, could i take a photo?\". \"of course!\" he answers, before asking my name and coming over to stand next to me. \"my name's judith\" i reply. \"i'm barack obama, nice to meet you!\" he says, and puts his arm across my shoulder. i put my arm around his hip -- wow, he didn't even sweat! what a man!\"\n",
