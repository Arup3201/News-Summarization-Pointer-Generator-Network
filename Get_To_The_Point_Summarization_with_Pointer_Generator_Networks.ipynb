            "One of the CNN articles: (cnn) -- jerry yellin has spent most of his life trying to forget about the stench of death on the island of iwo jima 65 years ago. yellin was a p-51 fighter pilot who had turned 22 a few weeks before he touched down on the island march 7, 1945, amid some of the bloodiest fighting of world war ii's pacific campaign. \"to one side, there were mounds and mounds and mounds of bodies of japanese soldiers being pushed around by bulldozers into mass graves. and right behind our squadron area was the marine mortuary, where they'd lay out the bodies, check their dog tags and fingerprint them for identification,\" recalls yellin, an 87-year-old retiree who lives in vero beach, florida. \"i've lived with those memories all of my life and it was not something i ever wanted to go back to.\" nevertheless, yellin was back on the island last week for the first time since 1945 to attend a ceremony commemorating the battle's 65th anniversary. about 22,000 japanese soldiers died defending the island, along with more than 6,000 americans, in a battle that was memorialized in the iconic photograph of five u.s. marines and a navy corpsman raising the u.s. flag atop mount suribachi, the island's dormant volcano. the americans secured the island on march 26, 1945, marking the u.s. military's most significant advance in its island-hopping strategy to reach japan. but the battle proved to be longer and deadlier than planners had anticipated, depleting much of the u.s. military's resources. the u.s. abandoned its plan to invade the japanese mainland and turned to the atomic bomb to end the war. since 1995, the japanese and american associations of iwo jima have met on the 8-square-mile island, now known as iwo to, to commemorate the 35-day battle with a \"reunion of honor.\" yellin and several other veterans made the day-long trip to iwo jima from guam on march 3 with the tour company, military tours. each man had his own reason for going, but all left united through the shared experience of an event that only a few can understand, says cyril \"cy\" o'brien, a marine correspondent who covered the battle of iwo jima, who also made the trip. \"in a way, it's reliving something that happened so long ago that was probably what i would consider some of the most ennobling moments of our lives. i am a writer, too, so going there this time, looking at the terrain and seeing this hill, this cliff, this gorge, opens a whole new page to the memory,\" he says. o'brien, a retired newspaper reporter who is working on a book about his experiences as a war correspondent, has been back to iwo jima for the reunion of honor four times. but the sense of awe never diminishes as the first sight of the island from the plane, he says. \"when we approached iwo jima and saw suribachi, you would be amazed what happens. everything became as quiet and as solemn as if we'd entered a cathedral. you could tell the island had captivated everyone, the island had brought them back to their youth. the first moment was a very stirring moment. always is,\" he says. for yellin, it has been a longer journey back to the battlefield where, as a young airman, he left behind 11 comrades, sparking years of bitterness and racial prejudice. yellin recalls passing over the flag each time he and his brothers flew a mission to support the marines on the ground, who faced the formidable task of taking the island from a military force on its last stand. \"i never thought of the people on the ground as people. you can hate somebody so much that you don't see them as people,\" he says. \"i had no desire to go back to japan. why the hell would you want to visit the place where your enemy was? who wants to visit the people you fought against and hated?\" the healing began in 1988, when his son married a japanese woman whose father was a pilot in the japanese imperial army air service, who also flew missions in iwo jima. yellin's son's future in-laws opposed the marriage until the men met and shared their experiences in iwo jima. \"i hated him and he hated me. we met for the first time three days before the wedding. and he said, 'any man that could fly a p-51 against the japanese and live must be a brave man, and i want the blood of that man to flow through the veins of my grandchildren.'\" he says. \"then, my son got married and started having children and my whole life expanded. i saw that human beings were killed in the war, and they were kind people, they were bright people, and now they're my family.\" through the marriage, the two wartime enemies made peace, a process that yellin documented in a novel published last year, \"of war & weddings.\" but he still never considered visiting iwo jima until he was offered an opportunity to commemorate his fallen brothers -- 11 in combat and five in training -- from the 78th fighter squadron in a ceremony during the reunion of honor. upon learning of his plans, yellin's 18-year-old grandson expressed interest in seeing the place where his grandfathers had once fought each other. \"i just didn't want to relive all that, but because i have a japanese grandson and because he wanted to go, i had to go,\" says yellin. \"and i'm happy, delighted, thrilled that i went. i cried most of the day, from the moment we landed. many memories came back, and we did a memorial for the 16 guys. it was like closing the circle.\"\n",

            "One of the Dailymail articles: (cnn) -- jerry yellin has spent most of his life trying to forget about the stench of death on the island of iwo jima 65 years ago. yellin was a p-51 fighter pilot who had turned 22 a few weeks before he touched down on the island march 7, 1945, amid some of the bloodiest fighting of world war ii's pacific campaign. \"to one side, there were mounds and mounds and mounds of bodies of japanese soldiers being pushed around by bulldozers into mass graves. and right behind our squadron area was the marine mortuary, where they'd lay out the bodies, check their dog tags and fingerprint them for identification,\" recalls yellin, an 87-year-old retiree who lives in vero beach, florida. \"i've lived with those memories all of my life and it was not something i ever wanted to go back to.\" nevertheless, yellin was back on the island last week for the first time since 1945 to attend a ceremony commemorating the battle's 65th anniversary. about 22,000 japanese soldiers died defending the island, along with more than 6,000 americans, in a battle that was memorialized in the iconic photograph of five u.s. marines and a navy corpsman raising the u.s. flag atop mount suribachi, the island's dormant volcano. the americans secured the island on march 26, 1945, marking the u.s. military's most significant advance in its island-hopping strategy to reach japan. but the battle proved to be longer and deadlier than planners had anticipated, depleting much of the u.s. military's resources. the u.s. abandoned its plan to invade the japanese mainland and turned to the atomic bomb to end the war. since 1995, the japanese and american associations of iwo jima have met on the 8-square-mile island, now known as iwo to, to commemorate the 35-day battle with a \"reunion of honor.\" yellin and several other veterans made the day-long trip to iwo jima from guam on march 3 with the tour company, military tours. each man had his own reason for going, but all left united through the shared experience of an event that only a few can understand, says cyril \"cy\" o'brien, a marine correspondent who covered the battle of iwo jima, who also made the trip. \"in a way, it's reliving something that happened so long ago that was probably what i would consider some of the most ennobling moments of our lives. i am a writer, too, so going there this time, looking at the terrain and seeing this hill, this cliff, this gorge, opens a whole new page to the memory,\" he says. o'brien, a retired newspaper reporter who is working on a book about his experiences as a war correspondent, has been back to iwo jima for the reunion of honor four times. but the sense of awe never diminishes as the first sight of the island from the plane, he says. \"when we approached iwo jima and saw suribachi, you would be amazed what happens. everything became as quiet and as solemn as if we'd entered a cathedral. you could tell the island had captivated everyone, the island had brought them back to their youth. the first moment was a very stirring moment. always is,\" he says. for yellin, it has been a longer journey back to the battlefield where, as a young airman, he left behind 11 comrades, sparking years of bitterness and racial prejudice. yellin recalls passing over the flag each time he and his brothers flew a mission to support the marines on the ground, who faced the formidable task of taking the island from a military force on its last stand. \"i never thought of the people on the ground as people. you can hate somebody so much that you don't see them as people,\" he says. \"i had no desire to go back to japan. why the hell would you want to visit the place where your enemy was? who wants to visit the people you fought against and hated?\" the healing began in 1988, when his son married a japanese woman whose father was a pilot in the japanese imperial army air service, who also flew missions in iwo jima. yellin's son's future in-laws opposed the marriage until the men met and shared their experiences in iwo jima. \"i hated him and he hated me. we met for the first time three days before the wedding. and he said, 'any man that could fly a p-51 against the japanese and live must be a brave man, and i want the blood of that man to flow through the veins of my grandchildren.'\" he says. \"then, my son got married and started having children and my whole life expanded. i saw that human beings were killed in the war, and they were kind people, they were bright people, and now they're my family.\" through the marriage, the two wartime enemies made peace, a process that yellin documented in a novel published last year, \"of war & weddings.\" but he still never considered visiting iwo jima until he was offered an opportunity to commemorate his fallen brothers -- 11 in combat and five in training -- from the 78th fighter squadron in a ceremony during the reunion of honor. upon learning of his plans, yellin's 18-year-old grandson expressed interest in seeing the place where his grandfathers had once fought each other. \"i just didn't want to relive all that, but because i have a japanese grandson and because he wanted to go, i had to go,\" says yellin. \"and i'm happy, delighted, thrilled that i went. i cried most of the day, from the moment we landed. many memories came back, and we did a memorial for the 16 guys. it was like closing the circle.\"\n",

            "(cnn) -- tom de la hunty took dutch bobsledder edwin van calker to the whistler sliding center track one last time tuesday and asked his driver if he could do it. he wasn't asking him to win; he was asking him whether he could compete. the coach and his pilot walked the course, and de la hunty told van calker to think about it, giving him an hour to make a decision. time offered no healing. van calker told his coach he just couldn't drive this track and so on wednesday the four-man no. 1 sled from the netherlands pulled out of the olympics. because their driver was terrified. \"i've never seen someone get to a major event and not compete because they're scared. you keep your inner fears to yourself and do it,\" de la hunty told reporters at a news conference. \"that's why it's such a popular sport in the military. it's that kind of macho sport. you go over the top together.\" van calker, ranked 11th on the world cup four-man tour, crashed on his first run during two-man practice on saturday. that and the memories of other crashes, including one that resulted in two teammates in the hospital, were too much for van calker. he never felt comfortable on the track during the two-man competition when he and teammate sybren jansma finished 14th. he and the rest of the four-man team were absent from two training runs on tuesday, as he struggled with what to do. it didn't help that eight sleds crashed on that first day of training. and so that night, he made the decision to give up. \"i have to look after my boys and can't close my eyes to that,\" he told reporters. \"for me, it's not about performing. it's about surviving.\" it was a split decision among the team to quit the games, said de la hunty, who talked about how he told his driver he was making a choice he would regret forever. \"i've told him that to his face,\"de la hunty said, \"but as a coach i have to support it because i'm responsible for him sending his team down the track in the right frame of mind.\" for timothy beck, who wanted to continue, it was a heart-wrenching outcome to his last olympics. the man who carried the dutch flag in the opening ceremonies said there was no tension on the team, but he wasn't the one looking out for three teammates. \"if you ask me if i want to slide i'd say, 'yes'. but i don't have to steer; i just get in the back and go down. i don't have the responsibility,\" said beck. but he also said he was upset that he'd come to his third olympics and would not get a chance to compete. \"this was my last chance to do something special,\" said the 33-year-old, who competed in the 2002 winter olympics and the 2004 summer olympics on the track team. jansma said he was frustrated because he wanted to show the world the progress the netherlands has made in bobsled, but safety was paramount. arnold van calker, the fourth member of the team, supported his brother's decision, pointing to the difference in the size of the two- and four-man sleds. the two-man sled is smaller and easier to control. arnold van calker, who had his doubts about the safety of the track, worried his brother had lost his nerve and wouldn't be able to steer the big sled through turns 11, 12 and 13. not even changes to the track on tuesday could help reassure the brothers. \"it was a lot better, but for us it was maybe too late,\" arnold van calker said. de la hunty pinned some of the blame on arnold's wife, saying that she had been worried about her husband's safety ever since georgian luger nodar kumaritashvili had crashed and died on the same track during the first day of the games. \"when arnold is scared and upset, obviously it has influence,\" he said. but arnold van calker said the death had no influence, and edwin van calker agreed that the track was not to blame for his decision. \"it's a challenging and exciting track. you have to deal with it as a pilot. that comes with the job. sometimes you deal with it less good,\" he said. \"it's nothing to do with the track, just my lack of confidence at the moment.\" competition in the four-man competition starts friday with the medals decided on saturday after the last of four runs.\n",

            "new york (cnn) -- the u.s. population is expected to top out at close to 312.8 million people just around the time crowds gather to watch the ball drop on new year's eve, according to new census data released thursday. the figure represents a 0.7% increase from last year, adding 2,250,129 people to the u.s. population since the start of 2011, and a 1.3% increase since census day, april 1, 2010. the agency estimates that beginning in january, one american will be born every eight seconds and one will die every 12 seconds. u.s.-bound immigrants are also expected to add one person every 46 seconds. that combination of births, deaths and migration is expected to add a single person to the u.s. population every 17 seconds, the census bureau said. meanwhile, millions are set to ring in the new year. in new york, authorities are preparing for large crowds in manhattan's times square, where lady gaga is expected to join mayor michael bloomberg to push the button that drops the waterford crystal ball at 11:59 p.m. et on new year's eve. \"and i'm so looking forward to performing on nye+dropping the ball with mayor bloomberg!\" the pop star posted on twitter. \"what an honor as a new yorker.\" past guests have included muhammad ali, rudy giuliani, colin powell and bill and hillary clinton. on thursday, officials conducted new york's annual \"airworthiness test\" -- a process in which confetti is tossed by handfuls above times square -- in preparation for the annual city tradition of dumping one ton of confetti over revelers in the iconic square. the big apple this year edged out las vegas for the first time in seven years as the top travel u.s. destination for those celebrating the new year, according to a december travel booking website poll. seven new york neighborhoods made the top 10 list, with two districts in las vegas and one in new orleans making up the other three, according to the priceline poll. \"it appears that new york city will be helped this year by a weather forecast that calls for warmer than usual temperatures over the holiday weekend,\" said company spokesman brian ek.\n",
