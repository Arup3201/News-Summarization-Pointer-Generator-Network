lingers for last look . 1 . rebuild infastructure . cherry davis , who has been struggling in the los angeles job market for the past couple of years , believes she knows the best way for the president to create jobs , taking inspiration from president franklin d. roosevelt . davis thinks rebuilding the nation \\'s infrastructure , part of what she terms \" a modern new deal , \" would be the best thing obama could focus on in his new term . she voted for obama this election . \" i believe that our country is behind and it \\'s because we are not rebuilding our infrastructure , \" she said . \" instead , we are using the same methods that took place after the great depression . we need to rebuild our infrastructure from energy to roads to bridges . \" \" this would get america back to work building a larger tax base and bringing the middle class back . we need to keep up with technology from a nationwide high speed rail , to our power grid . updating our nation will create jobs . \" davis said that she would take a job to help rebuild the country \\'s infrastructure if one became available . cnn.com commenter \" leftcoastrocky , \" agreed . \" our infrastructure has been neglected for a full generation and is making our economy less efficient and more expensive . \" a tale of two terms : unfinished business and battles ahead . 2 . improve education in the united states . education ranked fourth on our list of top issues during the election as voted by cnn.com readers and ireporters , so it was less of a surprise to see obama voter and rising east carolina university student tyler stocks mention this topic . stocks said he relies on financial aid for his education , as increasing college tuition and textbook prices have been a strain . costs have risen as much as 8.3 % at public universities , according to a 2011 u.s department of education study . \" i plan to transfer to a university in the summer but am worried about how to pay for it , \" he said . \" even with financial aid , education has become a matter of affordability and the whole idea of following your dreams is difficult when you ca n\\'t afford to . i am hoping that the president can work to ensure that students such as i are afforded with the opportunity to receive a good education . \" as david evan karasek put it in cnn.com \\'s comments , \" educating our young to compete

to death . a nurse in texas catches ebola ; her dog is fed , taken away and put into quarantine . the stark difference in treatment illustrates the lack of solid protocol on what to do with ebola victims \\' pets -- and highlights what little is known about the risk . why are we even talking about this ? focusing on the cases of two dogs can seem trivial compared to the 4,000 people in west africa who have died from ebola this year . but cnn \\'s anderson cooper notes that concern about animals can have a broader impact on human health . \" we \\'ve seen this in disasters before , people not wanting to leave their homes because they could n\\'t bring their animals to a shelter , \" he said . \" the fear among health care workers and cdc officials and others is that if people are afraid that their dogs are going to be killed , they might not come forward if they \\'re starting to show some symptoms . \" so , can pets get or spread ebola ? \" at this time , there have been no reports of dogs or cats becoming sick with ebola or of being able to spread ebola to people or other animals , \" the centers for disease control and prevention says . some studies have shown that dogs may experience asymptomatic ebola infections , the cdc says -- meaning they may have the virus but do n\\'t get sick . also , the agency says , human infections have n\\'t been linked to dogs . \" the risk activities that lead to human infections are direct contact with infected human body fluids , or through bats or consumption of infected wild meat . \" but it \\'s not yet clear whether a pet \\'s body , paws or fur can pick up and spread ebola to people or other animals . biology professor david sanders said some animals , like fruit bats , can carry the virus without showing any symptoms and could infect others . \" the concept that viruses in animals can be transmitted to humans and can have potential harmful consequences , that \\'s obvious , \" said sanders who teaches at purdue university . \" so infected animals that are not showing signs of infection can potentially be capable of transferring virus to humans . \" do we really need to worry about pets getting ebola ? not at all , said dr. william schaffner , chair of preventative medicine at vanderbilt university . \" it is not a danger . we \\'re not concerned , \" schaffner told cnn \\'s state of the union with candy crowley . \" we know that this virus can circulate in animals , but pets have not been a feature of ebola spread , whether in africa and certainly not here in the developed world , \" he said . \" we all thought that the attention in spain to the dog of the person who was ill was ill - advised and was a distraction . \" so why did the dog in spain have to die ? more than 400,000 people signed an online petition asking spanish authorities to spare the life of excalibur , the dog of nursing aide teresa romero ramos . romero is in critical condition after helping treat an infected spanish missionary . but madrid health authorities insisted they had to euthanize excalibur in case the canine had ebola . critics said the dog should have been quarantined , just like romero \\'s husband has been . what about the nurse \\'s dog in texas ? bentley , the dog belonging to infected texas nurse nina pham , is now safe with dallas animal services and adoption center and was taken tuesday to hensley field , a decommissioned naval air base that \\'s now owned by the city . he \\'ll be monitored at the former military complex where he \\'s been given bedding and toys to keep him

. california lt. gov. gavin newsom is publicly asking the san francisco 49ers to bench mcdonald pending the outcome of his felony domestic violence investigation . \" ( t ) he 49ers \\' continued insistence on playing ray mcdonald during his ongoing criminal investigation is a painful affront to every victim of domestic violence and sends a troubling message to our community and especially our children that \\' zero tolerance \\' are empty words , not real actions , \" newsom and his wife said in a message on facebook . mcdonald was arrested on august 31 on suspicion of felony domestic violence after he allegedly got involved in an altercation with his fiancee , who was 10 weeks pregnant , a police source told the sacramento bee . the fiancee showed police minor bruises on her neck and arms , the newspaper said . after mcdonald posted bail , he said he could n\\'t say much about the case . \" the truth will come out , \" he told cnn affiliate ktvu . \" everybody knows what kind

\\'s actions . after public outcry over a two - game suspension for rice , the nfl established a six - game unpaid ban for personnel who violate the league \\'s policy on domestic violence , goodell said thursday . a second incident would be punished by a lifetime ban from the league , goodell said in a letter to the owners of the league \\'s 32 teams . other players have been disciplined over the past week . minnesota vikings running back adrian peterson was deactivated after he was indicted by a grand jury last week on a child abuse charge . he allegedly whipped his 4 - year - old son repeatedly with a \" switch . \" but his attorney said peterson is \" a loving father \" who was disciplining his son . \" he used the same kind of discipline with his child that he experienced as a child growing up in east texas , \" attorney rusty hardin said . and on sunday , the carolina panthers announced just before game time that defensive end greg hardy would not be playing against the detroit lions . in may , authorities say , hardy choked his then - girlfriend , dragged her by her hair and threatened to kill her . he was sentenced in july to 18 months of probation and a 60 - day suspended sentence for the misdemeanors he was charged with . hardy said he is innocent and has appealed a guilty verdict . in his post-game remarks sunday , panthers coach ron rivera alluded to the controversy looming over not just hardy , but over the entire league . \" the climate has changed , \" he said . \" we really do have to get this right . believe me . i understand that . \" tough

allowed by the faa up to 400 feet , and within sight of the operator . if they are going to fly within three miles of an airport , they have to let air traffic controllers know . flying unmanned aerial vehicles is illegal for most business purposes ; however , governments and public entities such as police departments can apply for permission to operate them . the faa has been working to setup new rules and to safely integrate the use of unmanned aircraft into the national air space , and last year opened an \" unmanned aircraft systems integration \" office .\\x1f\\x11\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\n\\x9c\"\\n\\x85\\x02\\n\\x08abstract\\x12\\xf8\\x01\\n\\xf5\\x01\\n\\xf2\\x01<s> congress passed major parks and wilderness legislation . </s> <s> it \\'s the largest expansion for the national park service in decades . </s> <s> while the bill had bipartisan support , it underwent some turbulence by conservatives . </s>\\n\\x91 \\n\\x07article\\x12\\x85 \\n\\x82 \\n\\xff\\x1ftucked inside the defense authorization bill that the senate passed friday was an unrelated public lands package that \\'s set to bring the biggest expansion to the national park service in decades . despite some conservative opposition \\xe2\\x80\\x94 a chorus that skewered the legislation as a pork - barrel land grab \\xe2\\x80\\x94 the measure also establishes thousands of acres of new wilderness areas . the bill designates seven sites as official national park units , many of which place a special emphasis on history , such as manhattan project work sites in new mexico , tennessee and washington state . grand canyon , other national parks could cost more . sites in new york related to harriet tubman \\'s life will be added as a park unit , and parts of the underground railroad in maryland will be formally named a part of the national park service . tule springs fossil beds outside of las vegas is set to become a national monument , preserving its thousands of fossils that show traces of ice age mammoths , bison , and american lions . \" this legislation clearly demonstrates that congress and the administration are making national parks a national priority , \" said clark bunting , president of national parks conservation association . untamed wilderness in the tetons . the legislation also expands nine national park sites \\xe2\\x80\\x94 such as the apostle islands , oregon caves national monument , and gettysburg national military park \\xe2\\x80\\x94 and extends funding for 15 national heritage areas . all told , roughly 120,000 acres will be newly managed by the park service , and the number of official park units will jump from 401 to 408 . that many acres may not sound like a lot - alaska \\'s denali national park alone is six million acres - but it \\'s the single largest package of park units approved since an omnibus parks bill in 1978 that authorized 14 new units . in addition to new park units , the bill also establishes 245,000 acres of new wilderness land , nearly half of which was already being managed by federal employees . summer in the park : great smoky mountains . while the bill passed with bipartisan support , it did not come without drama . thirty - two republicans voted against the defense authorization package in the house last week , in part because of its inclusion of park and wilderness provisions . on the senate side , just hours before the final vote on friday , sen. tom coburn , r - oklahoma , took to the floor to call for the public lands provisions to be stripped from the defense bill , saying the expansion was a \" disastrous idea \" because any new funding needs to go towards improving the current parks system . \" our parks are falling apart . there \\'s $ 12 billion backlog on our most pristine , greatest national monuments and parks , \" he said , referring to the national park service \\'s coffers . \" we should preserve what we \\'ve already invested in . \" sen. mike lee , r - utah , argued in a floor speech wednesday that drafters of the legislation \" egregiously \" forced the public lands provisions in the package through a \" distorted legislative process . \" sen. ted cruz , r - texas , called it an \" extreme \" land grab and urged the house and senate not to pass it . \" with the military \\'s shrinking budget , it is offensive that this bill would be used to fund congressional pork , \" he said in a statement last week . kristen brengel , senior director of legislation and policy , at the npca , argued that much of the parks land is already owned by the government and is merely changing management . millions flocked to national parks last year , despite shutdown . the bureau of land management , for example , oversees tule springs , but will soon be run by the national park service . the department of energy owns manhattan project sites . and the federal government owns valles caldera national preserve but the location is currently managed by a special trust . the legislation also includes some concessions for republicans , including 110,000 acres of federal land being released into private or state control through conveyances , exchanges or sales .'\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["How BufferReader class objects
