'he seemed to have a little bit more about him than the typical kid who plays computer games so i tossed him an 11-inch piece of elm for a wagon wheel hub and he nailed first time on the lathe , ' said mr rowland .

' watson said that means prosecutors would have to prove howard intentionally caused her son 's death . 'they have to show that by duress she intended to bring about his suicide as opposed to failing to get him medical care when she should have reasonably assumed that he had ingested her medication , ' watson said . 'that 's what intentionally means under indiana law - that her intent was to bring about a specific result . ' similar charges have been rejected by courts over the last decade . in 2006 , the connecticut supreme court overturned the conviction of a connecticut woman who prosecutors said kept such a messy home that it endangered her 12-year-old son 's safety and mental health . the boy , daniel scruggs , killed himself in 2002 , and the case sparked a national debate over what responsibility a parent holds for a child 's suicide . concerned : family of the teen say he was depressed over his mother 's drug use and her reluctance to quit that drove him to also attempt suicide in january . the court in the scruggs case found prosecutors could n't identify objective standards to determine when a messy house becomes a risk to a child 's mental health . in howard 's case , prosecutors may still be weighing whether to proceed with the causing suicide charge , watson said . messages left for the delaware county prosecutor were n't immediately returned tuesday . jail records listed no attorney for howard . according to the probable cause affidavit , howard told officers on july 10 that she thought her son had taken her pills - including 30 xanax and 26 lortabs - when she found him on the couch . in an interview with police days later , she said she confronted her son about 8.30 am on july 10 about drugs that were missing . she said he denied taking them but she suspected otherwise because he had slow speech and was 'groggy acting . ' ignored : hours before his death the mother said she confronted her son on her couch about taking her pills and though he denied it she told police he appeared groggy . 'sabrina even told charles that what he consumed could kill him , ' the affidavit says . but howard allegedly did not seek medical help for her son . she told police she instead checked on him periodically during the day as he slept on a couch to make sure 'he was still breathing . ' howard called 911 about eight hours later , at 4.45 pm , after she checked on charles and found him not breathing and with a grayish/white skin color . according to the affidavit , howard told officers that she was a former intravenous morphine abuser . but officers said in the document they noticed what appeared to be 'fresh track marks on her left wrist/hand area ' and relatives told them 'she is still using . ' a relative who answered the telephone on tuesday at howard 's parents ' home said the family has been devastated by the charges and did not want to speak to media . stephanie mcfarland , a spokesman for indiana 's department of child services , said the agency had contact with howard 's family 'recently .

'' after a heavy defeat in their opening confederations cup game against nigeria , etaeta declared their dream had come true -- solely because they found the net in a 6-1 reverse . there was to be no goal this time round as they were put to the sword by spain who completed a 10-0 victory to all-but secure a semifinal berth . that represented the biggest in the history of the competition that pits the champions of each fifa confederation against each other and acts as a precursor to next year 's world cup in brazil . but tahiti 's squad were afforded a standing ovation from the 71,000 crowd , who backed them throughout the match . before the game there was a heavy police presence outside the ground in rio in response to the ongoing protests in brazil . `` tahiti set an example in terms of fair play and went forward whenever they had the opportunity , '' spain coach vicente del bosque said . `` we did n't score more goals because they did n't let us . this game has n't damaged football in any way . in some ways it 's made it even stronger . '' after handing over pendants to their opponents prior to kickoff , tahiti maintained parity for less than five minutes as chelsea striker fernando torres beat goalkeeper mikael roche at his near post to put the `` la roja '' ahead . any tahiti foray into spain 's half was roared by the crowd but del bosque 's side soon fired two goals in the space of two minutes as david silva and torres found the net . david villa grabbed a goal either side of the break before torres sealed his hat-trick just before the hour mark -- making him the first player to do it twice in the tournament following his three against new zealand in 2009 . villa 's treble followed soon after , and juan mata then got number eight . torres missed the chance to claim his fourth , sending a penalty over the crossbar after ricky aitamai was adjudged to have handled the ball . but he made amends a minute later as he rounded roche to slot into an empty net . silva then got his second , firing home from inside the area . the crowd were willing tahiti forward but the closest they came to scoring was when lorenzo tehau narrowly failed to latch onto marama vahirua 's pass , but the offside flag had gone up . upon the final whistle , tahiti gave spain a guard of honor as the world champions left the pitch before the minnows took the applause of the crowd . however , the battle for semifinal places will go to the last round of group b matches , following uruguay 's 2-1 victory over uruguay in thursday 's late match . veteran striker diego forlan celebrated his landmark 100th international appearance -- becoming the first uruguayan to do so -- by scoring the winner six minutes after halftime . the 34-year-old finished off a fine move involving strike partners edison cavani and luis suarez , ending his run of 12 games without a goal for the south american champions . it was his 34th goal for his country , putting him ahead of suarez in the all-time list . captain diego lugano gave uruguay the lead in the 19th minute but chelsea midfielder john obi mikel equalized eight minutes before the break . if uruguay beat tahiti on sunday , then nigeria 's super eagles would have to inflict spain 's first defeat of the tournament in order to qualify .\"\n"," b\"by . snejana farberov . a wisconsin couple has filed a wrongful death lawsuit against a popular caregiver website they had used to hire a nanny accused of killing their infant daughter . a lawsuit filed by nathan and reggan koopmeiners in kenosha county circuit court names both the company , care.com , and nanny sarah gumm as defendants . gumm , 35 , is jailed in lake county , illinois , where she is charged with first-degree murder in the 2012 death of 3-month-old rylan koopmeiners . caregiver : nanny sarah gumm , 35 ( left ) , has been named in a wrongful death lawsuit while awaiting trial on a first-degree murder charge in the 2012 beating death of 3-month-old rylan koopmeiners ( right ) finger of blame : the parents ' lawsuit alleges that care.com failed to reveal that gumm had a record , including two citations for drunken driving and a battery incident . the woman stands accused of causing a head injury that resulted in the baby 's death at her home in waukegan , illinois . the koopmeiners allege care.com , based out of waltham , massachusetts , failed to reveal that gumm had a court record , including two citations for drunken driving and a battery incident -

'he seemed to have a little bit more about him than the typical kid who plays computer games so i tossed him an 11-inch piece of elm for a wagon wheel hub and he nailed first time on the lathe , ' said mr rowland .
