*Used the Pointer Generator Network for coming up with this summarization technique which turns out to give better ROUGE score than the simple encoder and decoder model. Using Pointer also improved the UNK tokens which appeared a lot and to cover up the problem of repetation in the summary I employed coverage mechanism.*

**MORE TO BE ADDED IN THE FUTURE**
